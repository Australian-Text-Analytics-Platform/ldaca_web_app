1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],195,David Trippier,Con,False,"The House has been patient for the last few weeks in waiting for this debate on housing. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) and we, too, have been patient in waiting for it. Now that the moment has arrived, I welcome the opportunity of emphasising the Government's strategy on this important subject. The Government's aim in housing is no different from that of any post-war Government. We want decent, affordable and suitable housing to be within the reach of all families. We differ from other Governments, and certainly the Opposition, on the best way of achieving that aim. Immediately after the war, there were three main policies to restore a decent standard of housing in Britain: first, a huge public sector programme of housebuilding; secondly, restrictions on private house-building to give priority to the public sector programme; and, thirdly, controls to keep rents down in the private rented sector. With about 2 million fewer houses than households, that crash programme approach was fairly understandable. As a direct comparison, today we have more houses than households-in fact, 300,000 more-so circumstances are very different. The post-war approach to housing worked by putting bureaucratic controls in place of market forces. One can do that for a while, but, in the end, market forces will have their revenge. If market forces and the resources of the private sector are suppressed, we will produce less, we will produce goods that people do not want, and it is certain that we will produce the wrong amount in the wrong places. Sadly, the post-war housing policies of big public sector building programmes and controls of private sector rents trundled on unchanged through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, long after the crisis of housing shortage everywhere had given way to a much more varied pattern of local needs that could not be solved by that blanket approach. As a result, we now have the largest state-owned or public housing sector in western Europe and the smallest private rented sector. Other countries have been far more successful in maintaining investment in the private rented sector by encouraging private investment, and by using public money to supplement private money rather than to replace it. For example, despite the war's devastation and massive immigration from East Germany, Germany managed to bring demand and supply for rented accommodation back into balance more quickly and effectively that we did. It did that by encouraging private investment. Today, 60 per cent. of German housing is rented, over 40 per cent. of the total is provided by private landlords, 13 per cent. by bodies similar to housing associations, and only 3 per cent. by municipalities. But here in this country, by insisting that subsidised housing had to be built for the public sector, be public sector-owned and have public sector landlords, we also helped to create the major economic problems that were fuelled by the excessive public expenditure which characterised the 1960s and 1970s.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,1,housing,490

The Labour party still does not seem to realise that the old approach carried the seeds of its failure and of that Government's destruction. In private renting, the fixing of rents at levels that could barely cover the cost of repairs has led to a catastrophic decline. Private renting provided 50 per cent. of the total stock of dwellings in the country immediately after the war. The figure is now only 8 per cent. That is in stark contrast to 30 per cent. in France and 40 per cent. in Germany. That 42 per cent. of the private rented stock is in poor condition is a direct consequence of the interference in the market that prevented good landlords from making a modest return and encouraged disreputable landlords- I thought that the hon.

1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],215,David Trippier,Con,False,"This is a short debate and I have already allowed perhaps half a dozen interventions. I have tried to be fair to the House, but I now must press on. The first of our policies is to put the consumer first. We believe that people can, should and want to take personal responsibility for their housing. State resources should be concentrated on those people who are genuinely in need and who are not able to compete in the market. But they, too, should have far more choice than they have had in the past, including the right to change their landlords if they do not get a decent service. The lack of response by the state-directed system of housing supply has meant that, although countryr j 3-8wide there are enough houses for everybody, there are severe local shortages in some areas. In areas of shortage, the most vulnerable households could suffer severely if Government support were cut off. So we intend to maintain a major programme of subsidised housing, but we cannot do that unless we make every penny of public money count. The second part of our policy is good housekeeping in the use of that public money. Because public expenditure must be limited, choices have to be made. The old approach, with its insistence on the exclusive use of public sector resources, while rents were often kept low for local political reasons, entailed a huge amount of waste and inefficiency. If we can get private investment to add to investment by the public sector in housing, why not do so and build more houses? If better-off people can afford to pay higher rents, why hold their rents down and so reduce the money available to support poorer people? Why should taxpayers, many of whom are not well off, pay subsidies to people who do not need them? Why should we use public investment where private investment will do the job? We should focus public resources on those who need them most-the poor, the elderly, the chronically sick and the handicapped. That approach of consumer choice, good housekeeping and focusing support on those with the greatest needs, has shaped the Government's housing policy since 1979. We started with the expansion of home ownership, but the Labour party attacked our right-to-buy policy.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,21,housing,382

Would he like to say something about tight planning controls and their effect on the price of building land? Is he aware that during the 1960s agricultural land was being released at almost three times the rate it is today and during the 1970s at almost twice the rate, and that the price of building land is going through the roof? In the north-west prices increased by 90 per cent. in 1987 and are likely to have more than doubled in 1988. There will be a great effect on the price of housing. Figures issued only last week show that the price of housing in Southampton went up by 50 per cent. last year.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,22,housing,148
1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],217,David Trippier,Con,False,"I have sympathy with my hon. Friend's remarks. That is precisely why my hon. and learned Friend the Minister for Water and Planning recently announced measures that will help to ease the position. I was saying that the Labour party viciously attacked the right-to-buy policy. The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) said that it would not work. But it has worked well; in fact, it has been an astonishing success. Well over a million council tenants have bought their own homes since 1979, which is bringing in billions of pounds of private resources to ease the strain on the public purse. They are taking the management of their housing into their own hands. There have been 4 million first-time buyers since we came to power in 1979. Two out of three households in England own their own homes. Now we are tackling the rented sector. First, in the rented sector, new tenancies at market rents will encourage existing landlords to continue renting. The tax incentives in the business expansion scheme will accelerate that process. Secondly, in the housing association sector, a 70 per cent. increase in public resources will be supplemented by extra private money to give it new impetus. Thirdly, the financial system for councils' housing will be changed so that they cannot hide poor performance by subsidies from the rates. If they do not operate efficiently, the results will be only too visible to their tenants. When authorities like Southwark can allow properties to remain vacant between relets for an average of 24 weeks, or nearly half a year, it cannot be denied that better management is badly needed. Just nine Labour-controlled inner London boroughs, and Liverpool, account for 38 per cent. of the national total of rent arrears, at Â£86 million between them. Large amounts of arrears, sometimes running into four figures, are owed by individual Labour councillors. It cannot be denied that better accountability is vital.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,23,housing,323

1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],219,David Trippier,Con,False,"I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am well aware of his estates. He knows that because of my frequent visits to Liverpool. My interview on Radio Merseyside this morning with Keva Coombes resulted in the leader of Liverpool city council admitting that it was totally unacceptable to have arrears at the level they are in Liverpool and that it adversely affected those who were paying their rents as well as the ratepayers, because the council has been taking money from the general rate fund to subsidise the housing revenue account. Council tenants who feel unhappy with the service that they are getting from their landlords will be able to opt out and accept a new landlord, often a housing association. Whether they go or stay, their freedom to choose will act as a stimulus to efficiency and service. Indeed, it is already doing so. There are plenty of examples of deathbed repentance by councils who are trying to win back the affections of their tenants. In addition, a new system for allocating resources for investment by councils would ensure that resources for renovation are much better focused on the areas of real need, rather than on areas that have the most receipts. Opposition Members should welcome such a change, if only they understood it, for many of the areas that they represent will benefit. In the recent Second Reading debate, the hon. Member for Hammersmith seemed to understand so little that he appeared to be quite scandalised by a reform that would help the poorer areas. Alongside these policies, we are also introducing new arrangements for improvement grants, so that they are concentrated on those people who most need support, while maintaining a level of expenditure that in real terms is almost double the level of that it reached under the Labour Administration. Twice as much money will be available, and it will be better targeted on the less well off. I should have thought that Opposition Members would welcome that; but they would not recognise good news if it jumped up and hit them in the face. When combined, these new policies will have a much more effective impact on the most severe forms of housing need, including homelessness. Housing provided with the help of public sector funds will correspond much more closely with what the tenants themselves want. That is why they will no longer be entirely dependent on their local councils. That is why the Opposition are so agitated. Homelessness is one of the most bitter legacies of the old approach to housing that is still espoused by the Opposition. It really. is amazing that with 300,000 more houses than households there should still be more than 30,000 homeless families in temporary accommodation. There can be no clearer demonstration of the misallocation of resources that always results from a State-directed approach to housing. As the Audit Commission's report on homelessness pointed out, if the average period taken to re-let a vacant local authority property could be reduced by three weeks outside London and six weeks in London, the number of vacant properties could be reduced to such an extent that an extra 17,700 relets would become available. I know that the Housing Act 1988 has been debated exhaustively but there is one topic that needs to be dealt with now-the Opposition's misleading and irresponsible propaganda. All over the country, material is being produced and circulated to tenants on tenants' choice and housing action trusts, which is full of untruths. I am naturally constrained, Madam Deputy Speaker, to use parliamentary language. But it is full of untruths and half-truths and economical half-truths and terminological inexactitudes. Elderly tenants are terrified by leaflets suggesting that their properties are to be handed over to the reincarnation of Rachman. What deceit. The hon. Member for Hammersmith is party to that deceit. He undertook to condemn misleading propaganda about tenants' choice. He will recall giving me and the House that undertaking when we were considering the Housing Bill last November. The hon. Gentleman seems to have forgotten that promise. I wrote to him on 19 December, enclosing a leaflet produced by Nottinghamshire county council, which is full of complete distortions of the truth. I shall give just one example. It says that rents will go up to market levels under tenants' choice. There was no mention of the fact that the only landlords allowed in tenants' choice will have specifically signed up to charge rents that those on low incomes can afford. There was no mention of the fact that rent levels and arrangements for reviewing them will be one of the matters on which tenants vote.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,25,housing,775

Member for Hammersmith should not open his mouth at this precise time because I am about to refer to other things that he said he would do but has not done. Having sent two letters to me within one week prior to Christmas, he has not yet replied to my latest letter. It was probably lost in the Christmas post. When he challenged me to debate these issues in public-I cannot think of a more public place than this-in the media or on television, I was happy to accept. I repeat that acceptance now. I am happy to debate the issue with him or with any of his colleagues anywhere, at any time. I think that the hon. Gentleman has realised his mistake. I call on him seriously to condemn unreservedly the literature which is going round. If he does not wish to be associated with it-he clearly does not-let him condemn it, say what is wrong in it, and spell out to the House what he does not agree with so that the House and the country may know. The hon. Member for Hammersmith does not accept that some tenants may vote to pay slightly higher rents in return for better management and repairs. A recent survey by Glasgow university showed that almost 40 per cent. of tenants would be prepared to pay higher rents for a better service. Some may not, but it is their choice. It is not the Official Opposition's choice. It is not the Labour council's choice. It is not the choice of the wider Labour party or any one of its many divisions, and it has many divisions. It is not even the choice of the National and Local Government Officers Association. It is the tenants' choice. They, and they alone, should decide. But when fantasy, imagination, and deception fail him, the hon. Member for Hammersmith has recourse to amateur theatricals. It would be laughable were it not clearly intended to prevent legitimate debate. The way that he and his hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) tried to sabotage the wind-up speech in the recent Second Reading debate of my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) was a disgrace. I fear that it was all too typical of the way some Opposition Members are bringing on to the Floor of the House the deceitful scaremongering tactics used by their Left-wing activists against tenants. But in truth they resort to those tactics because they have nothing else to say, and because they are desperate to appease the bully boys who are no doubt crucial to their own reselection. Behind the Labour party's banner stand those who want to scare tenants into believing that only the council can provide for them; those whose power is threatened by tenants' freedom; and those whose inefficiency will be exposed by tenants' choice. The Labour party protests so much, as it has throughout my speech, because it is frightened at the prospect of competition for its municipal fiefdoms-",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,31,housing,548

Every time the Government try to duck it by referring to the past or to individual local authorities or councillors, they bring shame on themselves because they cannot face up to the problem. What is it? It is a crisis of mortgage rates and market rents. It is a catastrophe of escalating homelessness. It is a lack of low-cost accommodation for rent or sale. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's disastrous reliance on interest rates has clobbered home owners with a vengeance.

If the Minister looked at the figures and other evidence held by the BSA and other organisations, they would tell him something that he should already know. When house prices begin to stabilise after house price inflation as a result of interest rates remaining high over a sustained period, homelessness goes up owing to mortgage repossessions. The fastest growing area of homelessness is now due to mortgage repossessions. One in every 10 families is going to the local authority and asking for housing under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. They have been made homeless because they cannot pay their mortgages. The Minister makes the mistake, as he shouts from his sedentary position, of supposing that the problem relates only to individual mortgage companies such as the Nationwide Anglias of this world. However, it does not, because it affects many other lenders, including banks and other organisations. Many people have mortgages on which their payments are more than six months in arrears. I shall give the Minister the figures. In 1979, the number of mortgages that were more than six months in arrears-the Minister is fond of talking about arrears, and I shall return to that point-was 8,420. In 1986, the figure was 66,930.

Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) and I conducted a survey which showed that almost all banks and building societies were worried about their customers' ability to pay and were trying to find ways of making it easier for them.

If, as suggested, it is ultra vires, and the council has to freeze its position, it will walk away with Â£13 million profit. There will be no loss to the council-the figure in The Independent is wrong. The council would gain Â£13 million. But it pales into insignificance in the face of the problem that the Secretary of State has created for the Labour and Tory boroughs that have carried out such activities, by his refusal to introduce a proper system of local government finance. He tells local authorities to use business practices. Hammersmith and Fulham used them successfully and made Â£13 million profit. It is questionable whether it is illegal. We know one thing for sure: if a private company had acted in the same way, everybody would pat it on the back and say how well it had done. It would have been strictly legal in the private sector; it is only local authorities who must not trade in that way. I must stick to the point about which the Government are increasingly worried. The Government are blind to the problem being caused by those seeking to buy. A couple of weeks ago the Economic Secretary to the Treasury said: "" Mortgage rates show no correlation with difficulties over arrears or repossessions"".- Let him tell that to the people who are being made homeless, or those 20,000 people whose payments are in arrears. Do the Government think that money grows on trees for those people? The dream of home ownership is turning into a nightmare of bed-and-breakfast accommodation for increasing numbers of people, and the Government know that. The other day, The Daily Mirror presented the case of Mr. Soussa-one of the many growing examples of the Rachmanite and Hoogstraten-type experiences about which we have warned the Government. The Daily Mirror said that a family of three-two adults and a child-paid rent of Â£161 per week for one room and a shower which they shared with 10 other families. Their meal times were limited to half an hour a day in the dining room and there was no fire escape. When that story appeared in The Daily Mirror, Mr. Soussa gave the family two hours notice to quit and put them in the street. The council-which was not Labour-had to use other bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Other local authorities-including Conservative-controlled Southend-told the Minister that they could do nothing other than resort to bed-and-breakfast accommodation for such people because of the Government's housing cuts.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,54,housing,426

1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],250,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"The incident occurred in Windsor. The Minister does not understand that the accommodation is in Windsor and other local authorities use it. The argument is not about which councils place such families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Is the Minister really saying that Conservative councils do not use bed-and-breakfast accommodation? The argument is quite simply that local authorities-whether Labour, Tory or Liberal-are forced to use inadequate and inappropriate bed-and-breakfast accommodation because of the Government's policies. The leader of the Conservative group in Hammersmith, Councillor Peter Prince, has some interesting suggestions. He says that there is nothing wrong with paying Â£100 rent per week for a two-bedroomed flat-and that it is all right. Can hon. Members say how ordinary people on average incomes are supposed to pay Â£100 per week rent for a two-roomed flat? He said something far worse, which I should like the Minister to think about. In Hammersmith and Fulham, 19 people from Belfast who were threatened by the Provisional IRA have suddenly turned up. Two of the children had been kneecapped, one in both knees, with similar treatment to elbows and ankles. Quite rightly, Hammersmith and Fulham council put those people into bed-and-breakfast accommodation. It had experience of other cases, knew the dangers of sending them back and realised that it must help them. However, Conservative Councillor Peter Prince said they should he sent hack to Belfast. That was not only inhumane but also seems effectively to be saying to the Provisional IRA that it can carry on policing Northern Ireland because it is doing a good job. That is what the Conservative party is saying. I have encountered people in Hammersmith who are not in council accommodation but are running from both the Provisional IRA and the Unionist paramilitaries. What do I get from the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office? He says: "" Hence, while I have every sympathy for the problems faced by local councils"" in cases of this kind, he cannot help. As a result of the crisis in Northern Ireland, local authorities in Britain must either provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation, send the people back or provide housing out of their own stock. What will the Minister do about that? I have argued for many years that the Northern Ireland Office needs a policy to deal with people who are driven out in that way. I have every sympathy with Southend council, which has the same problems as Windsor, Slough and others. Indeed, Southend and the Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association and Association of District Councils say that they cannot cope without using bed-and-breakfast accommodation-because of the Government's policy. How does the Minister think that a family copes with education, health and family stress when they have to live in bed-and-breakfast accommodation and when the Government have no policy on homelessness? In 1978, a total of 53,110 homeless families were accepted. In 1987, the figure was 118,710. The sharp end of the problem is something that I never dreamt I would live to see in this country: men, women and children sleeping in cardboard boxes in the streets and parks of our towns, in both Tory and Labour areas. If the Minister and his hon. Friends really believe that that is the Labour party's fault, let me tell them that no one else believes it. Other people know that the housing crisis has been caused by the present Government. The Minister should not try to dodge that by blaming local authorities for the existence of empty properties. Let us get the figures nice and clear. At present 2Â·5 per cent. of local authority properties are empty, compared with 3Â·1 per cent. of housing association properties. Both those figures are pretty good, and should be treated with a degree of flexibility. The figure for the private sector is 4Â·2 per cent. And who is the worst offender of all? The Minister. Nearly 6 per cent. of properties owned by the Government are empty. Houses and flats with three, four and five bedrooms, valued at Â£150,000 to Â£200,000, have been empty for up to nine years. The Government, who have known about it for years, are to knock them down to make way for car parking and landscaping around Wormwood Scrubs prison. One in five police houses is empty, as are prison houses, defence houses and houses owned by London Regional Transport and other regional organisations. What the Minister likes to do is blame local authorities-to starve them of cash, undermine their morale and erode local democracy and to try to pretend that that solves the problem. He knows very well, however, that the problem lies at the Government's door. Horsham council actually gave an empty council house to none other than the Horsham constituency Conservative party to use as an office. I understand that it had to offer something because this was part of an improvement area-but an empty council house as an office?

Admittedly the junior Minister said that we could use four of them on a short-life basis, and a housing association is trying to do that, although it will be difficult to use four properties on such a basis. The other properties are not going to be used at all. Unfortunately, the examples that we give-including some that I have given about the Government-are irrelevant to the main cause, which is a drastic drying-up of the supply of low-cost accommodation for rent or sale. When the Minister opened the debate he revealed his naivety and inadequate grasp of the problem by saying that the country now contained more houses than people. In a technical sense, what he said was true, but it nevertheless showed a complete misunderstanding of the mismatch of properties to people. Having said that he recognised the problem of linking people and properties, the Minister did not go on to say how he would deal with it other than through the private market. The Government are saying that the private sector will provide, whereas local authorities cannot. What they are doing constitutes one of the nastiest forms of bullying that I have seen for many a long year. I attend meetings up and down the country which are packed out, with up to 400 people present. Many are very elderly-in their sixties, seventies and eighties. They go to the meetings because they are scared. If they are scared, it is not because of me. I attended meetings organised by people from the Minister's own council. Rochester upon Medway council in Kent has put out a leaflet. People who went to a meeting in the area wanted to know what would happen to them, as the leaflet mentioned no agreement other than one that might result at the end of the day. They were worried because they were being told to vote for an arrangement under which they would have no contract. I beg the Minister to recognize that many elderly people do not understand that housing associations are not just like any old private landlord.

When I read it, my knowledge of such matters led me to believe that what the organisers meant-and I suspect that their intentions are quite good-was that they would try to make it the same by drawing up a legal contract, but there is no legal contract here. If the hon. Lady took the leaflet along to a solicitor and asked "" Should I buy this?"" would he advise her to sign? Of course he would not. What is so wrong with her approach is that bullying and frightening people is unnecessary. The Minister talked about Nottinghamshire.

Gentleman to pick out any inaccuracies. I would say to him that at the time it was written it was basically accurate.- Since then, the Bill has gone through Committee and has been changed thanks to our amendments. We want to know also from the Government whether they intend to change the rigged voting system that has so frightened people that they know that their only solution is to group together as tenants and community groups to fight the Bill. One good thing, however, about that wretched Housing Act is that it has managed to create a sense of community in those areas, because they are so appalled by what is happening. I ask the Minister whether the Government will spend the money that they promised on the housing action trust areas now that they know that they have lost the argument there, too. Effectively, all the tenants have said no to their proposals since they rumbled the Government's other dishonesty. They discovered that the real aim of housing action trusts, according to the report prepared for the Government, was "" to successfully transfer the properties to the private sector."" That was something that the Government never told the tenants. That is the dishonesty and the deceit which causes the tenants to be fearful and makes me say that the Government are guilty of bullying tenants. What will the Government do about the new towns? The new towns will not even get a proper vote until in some cases they have waited two years to see how the new system works. Terrific: we will have a new government now; see how it works and then we will have a vote on it. How about that? Wht sort of democracy is that? Even some cheap dictator would riot accept that as a form of democracy. The housing statistics tell the grim story. In 1987 there were 30,000 fewer completions in all sectors compared to 1980. I warn the Minister of that, because that is what he was talking about when referring to public sector investment. Throughout the 1970s, housing investment was high when compared to European standards. Even investment in our worst year, which was 1979, was good compared to other European countries. What is significantly different now is that we are at the bottom of the heap-as we are with the National Health Service. Next year there will be a decline in the private building sector again, because of interest rates. The Government know that. In 1975, local authority completions were 103,000, in 1988 they are estimated to be 15,000 and in 1992 they will be 6,000. The Government have suddenly turned to housing assocations as the way out, but housing association completions are only about 2,000 above what they were in 1975. Somehow the housing associations are supposed to swallow local authority housing and build more at the same time. The management implications of that are appalling. In addition, there is the disaster of market rents in the private sector. We must remember that the rented sector has declined by 1Â·2 million houses, more than half of which are from the private rented sector. That decline has been caused by the Government's public expenditure. The Minister dodged my question about mortgage income tax relief. If he is prepared to accept someone on Â£7,000 per year getting a subsidy of about Â£300, but someone on Â£25,000 per year getting about Â£760, he had better work out where his priorities lie with Government expenditure. That is now up to nearly Â£6 billion. The nightmare about market rents is that they will approximate to what people pay to buy, which is why the private rented sector is declining. Mr. Rachman, Mr. Soussa-not really Mr. Soussa-and Mr. Hoogstraten are not really bad landlords; they are bad property developers. They want to sell with vacant possession, which means getting tenants out, and that is what the 1988 Bill is designed to make much easier.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,72,housing,690

They move in with relatives or wherever they can find accommodation in towns. Of course, in many areas they cannot find accommodation, and they end up sleeping rough. We are moving towards having ghettoes in our city areas where there will be the sort of crime and vandalism which the Government try to pin on local authorities. People have died behind their cast iron doors, which prevented the fire brigade from gaining access. The House should remember that those people installed such doors out of fear. People have to take such measures because the Government will not give local authorities the money needed to provide a good 24-hour concierge system. They starved my council of money for the Edward Woods estate almost long enough to push out of the annual programme the system that was designed to come into effect, but the council managed to keep it in. If the Government really cared, they would make sure that they helped good management. The Government's problem is that they do not understand that housing is about supply and management. If there is bad management, whether in the private or public sectors, something must be done about it. It is no good picking one or two councillors one does not like and putting the boot in. A housing problem must first be acknowledged and then the solution sought. That means more building, renovating and repairing. It also means that something must be done about bad management. The Minister said that he thought that people should have a choice of landlord, but he does not believe that. He believes that local authority tenants should be able to vote once only to change their landlord. But a tenant of Mr. Hoogstraten, Mr. Sonssa or Mr. Rachman would not have that choice. Let me give the House a commitment. The next Labour Government will give tenants of non-resident landlords the right to change their landlord, and, by God, we shall see some landlords changing then.

1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],282,James Spicer,Con,False,"I shall abide by your ruling to be brief, Madam Deputy Speaker. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) referred to holiday accommodation in Dorset. I hope that in the near future as a result of Government legislation much of that will cease to be holiday accommodation and become permanent accommodation. Landlords have holiday accommodation not because there is more money in it but because in the past they could not get the right sort of tenancy agreement to ensure repossession. I want to see more people living permanently in west Dorset rather than have the place flooded with holiday accommodation which is empty in the winter months; that is bad news. It is right that the debate should focus primarily on housing problems in the urban areas, but, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith said, there are problems in the rural areas, too. The scale is different, but there are unhappy people in rural areas just as there are in the towns. It is in that context that I welcome the statement made by my noble Friend the Minister for Housing, Environment and Countryside the other day that there would be an increase in the rural allocation for rented accommodation in 1990-91 and 1991-92. No one would deny that that increase is a drop in the ocean. A figure of 900 extra houses in 1990-91 is small. That figure goes up to 1,100 in 1991-92. That is nothing in the rural areas unless it is supported and enhanced by the activities of housing associations. Just a few months ago in my constituency a debate was organised by the Dorset county council which set out clearly our involvement with housing associations. I have set a personal target for west Dorset of 500 new housing association houses to rent or buy by the end of 1990. That target is achievable, but only under two conditions. The first and most important is that land should be given to housing associations, or at the very worst, provided at low cost. One may ask where that land will come from, but I can tell the House that in Dorset and Somerset many landlords who are members of the Country Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union, are perfectly prepared to give half an acre or an acre of land towards that end. They want to see local housing for local people at reasonable rents. That will come about, but not unless one particular area of mistrust is cleared up, and that is whether land given to a housing association for that purpose might be deemed at increased value for capital gains. This worry has not yet been cleared up. Everybody says that the point is being addressed, but why on earth does it need to he addressed? If people of their own volition are prepared to make a gift of land or to let it go at one tenth of the sum that such land would make on the open market for housing, why cannot the Treasury say that that is in the interests of the community and those who need houses and give a categorical assurance that there will be no such tax? Secondly, there is the matter of planning. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment was right to make it clear the other day that he hoped that local authorities would look more sympathetically at planning approval for housing association schemes for local people at low cost and to rent. I pay tribute to West Dorset district council which is implementing that policy. It is a dangerous policy, because a few starter homes may be included in the hope that approval will be given for a larger scheme. That is not what this is about. I hope that planners will significantly bend the rules for housing association schemes to help small villages. We are not talking about an estate of 200 or 300 houses but about a block of six or eight houses at the most for small villages in my constituency. If such housing does not come about, we shall see the continuing depopulation of our rural areas, along with the closure of sub-post offices and pubs, which is the last thing that I want to see. My plea to the Government is: please obtain that assurance from the Treasury. If we get that, we shall be able to get on with our building.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,88,housing,738
1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],283,George Howarth,Lab,False,"After 10 years in office the Government have managed to land themselves in one enormous mess on their housing policy. The Minister laughs, but if he looks at what is going on sector by sector, the evidence is plain for anybody to see. One principal cause of that is the Government's market philosophy, which has been demonstrated not to work in housing matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) has given some examples of that and I shall give some further examples. The truth of the matter is that housing policy does not lend itself to a non-interventionist policy. The Government should recognise that they must continue to engage with local authorities, housing associations and others in order to do something about housing. The more one disengages, the greater the problems are. The truth of what I say becomes more and more apparent when the situation is looked at sector by sector. For example, the owner-occupied sector, for which there is all-party support- There may be the odd exception but, broadly speaking, all parties' official policy is to support owner-occupation. High interest rates are now putting property, particularly for first-time buyers, out of their range. People simply cannot afford to get into the owner-occupier market- That might happen in the long term but it has not happened across the board yet. We find that people cannot enter the market. Indeed, some people are having to leave that sector because of the problems of high interest rates. The hon. Member for Langbaurgh (Mr. Holt) seems to think that there is something wonderful about high interest rates and mortgage costs. Perhaps I could summon up in support of my argument no less an authority than the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit), who writes in today's Evening Standard as follows: "" High mortgage rates are very unpopular but it is mortgage rates in the year before an election, not the second year after one which affect the general election result.""

The burden of my argument is that, as a direct result of high interest rates, there are people who are being prevented from entering the market and, equally, there are people who are being forced to leave the market because they cannot sustain their mortgage repayments. That is a simple fact of life at present. Whatever the long-term effects on that of macroeconomic policy, as matters stand that is what is happening. The other problem, which I have mentioned before in the House but which bears repetition, is that we have consistently falling standards of construction, space arid materials. I make it a practice to go on a fairly regular basis and look at new properties that are being built, some of them co-operative-in which I am heavily involved En my constituency-and some in the private sector. We are seeing properties which in 20 years time will be slums which are either put on the market or rented. That is because of the great pressure on people to get into the market at almost any cost. People do not have the kinds of choice that the Government would have us believe exist and consequently are forced either to rent-or in some cases, tragically, to purchase-properties of an appalling standard which will be real problem properties in 20 years' time.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,91,housing,242

1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],287,George Howarth,Lab,False,"I will cover that later in my speech. While there is disagreement between the Minister and me, he will accept that I understand the sort of problem that he is talking about. Another part of the problem in connection with owner-occupation currently is the whole mess of subsidy. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith mentioned that mortgage income tax relief costs about Â£6 billion. No one is against the idea that people who need help to get into the market should be given it through tax relief or by some other means. But what we have now is a totally unselective subsidy that does not serve any housing policy of which I know. Furthermore, for a Government that seem so obsessed with targeting other benefits, it is very strange that this very general policy should be sustained. I suspect that that reflects a little of the cynicism of the right hon. Member for Chingford because there is a definite electoral sweetie or bribe in that housing policy. That has to be sorted out if something is to be done about housing. I do not intend to go into the question of the private rented sector at any length. The Minister deplores the fact that only about 8 per cent. of the current stock in this country is private landlord stock. He might try and look at some of the causes of that. The Government have been in power for 10 years and that figure has not dramatically increased, but has declined, in that period. There are very real barriers to that market developing and one is that people do not trust it. Many of my constituents are familiar with the history of the Rachman era and are very cautious indeed about seeing that as a means of finding satisfactory housing. Other barriers have to do with the economics of housing in general, and the House will be familiar with the arguments which my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith adduced. The 1988 Act, which was supposed to deal with that, will not change the situation at all, because it did not deal with the root causes of the problem; it dealt with a series of rather fancy measures that will not change the situation at all. I suspect that the Minister already knows that it has failed to reinvigorate the private rented sector as they had hoped. That being the case, that policy has failed even on the Government's own terms. The Minister referred with some accuracy to some of the problems that exist in the borough of Knowsley, part of which I represent. I accept, and the Minister knows that my local authority accepts, that some of the problems connected with council housing in Knowsley stem from the difficulty of managing and maintaining a very large council stock. Originally, in 1974, there were, I think, 39,000 council houses in Knowsley, but with a combination of right to buy and some demolition and so on, the figure is now down to some 24,000. My local authority accepts that there is a problem in managing and maintaining a stock of council housing on that scale, so the policy of the borough of Knowsley is not to build any more properties. It feels that the policy for the foreseeable future should be concentrated on correcting the problems with the stock it already has and that any new housing needs should be met through housing co-operatives and associations, which it supports very well and vigorously. I accept that it is not necessarily always the case that local authority housing is the only way forward. On the other hand, even in the borough of Knowsley-the Minister is aware of these figures-and even with that policy, we currently need, to put the 24,000 properties with which we are left into some sort of reasonable order, Â£20 million a year. I use this as an example to illustrate the problems of local authorities. The housing investment programme allocation, even though it has recently gone up slightly, is still only about Â£4 million. With the use of capital receipts and other devices, perhaps that can be raised to Â£10 million, but that means that Â£10 million which needs to be spent on those properties every year is not being spent. Therefore, there will be an even further deterioration in the quality of life of the people who live in council houses, brought about not by the mismanagement of the local authority but by the scarcity of resources. The Government's solution to that is to introduce market conditions through the provisions in part IV of the 1988 Act. I will not go through all the arguments that my hon. Friends make, but I know, the House knows and anybody who takes an interest in housing knows, that those provisions will not work. What they have done is spread fear and concern among council tenants. What is quite staggering about this is that in many areas people who did not rate the council very highly as a landlord before this Act was put on the statute book are now saying that their local authority is wonderful. The Government hoped that they had denigrated local authorities, but they have succeeded in some areas in making the tenants appreciate the local authorities. In the housing association and housing co-operatives sector, in which I take a great interest, with the changes in mixed funding, in areas where the cost-value relationship is wrong-and that includes London and the whole of Merseyside-the very device that the Government said would increase the supply of money to housing associations and co-operatives will simply mean that the schemes will not get off the ground. The financial institutions will not engage in that kind of arrangement where the cost-value relationship is wrong, as it is in many parts of the country. I suspect that, once we reach the end of the first year of this new mixed funding arrangement there will be a massive underspend because the scheme cannot be applied in many parts of the country. That is something of which the Government have also made a mess. So after 10 years, in every sector imaginable, the Government have made an absolute hash of housing policy. They have done nothing to deal with the needs of people, nothing to create new housing for people in need. They have just let the market rip, and the market simply is not working.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,93,housing,1074

I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier) on his excellent speech and his grasp of the subject. I wish to broaden the debate a little. It is worth pointing out that we have a record number of homes in this country. The housing stock now stands at 23 million dwellings, an increase of about a third since 1961, and as a result we have a lot more property of all kinds. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) mentioned that there were about 20,000 families in difficulties. What he forgot to do was to put that in the context of 14Â·5 million owner-occupiers, some 9 million of them with mortgages; 25 per cent. of those people own their properties outright. In council housing, the subject of some of the speeches from the Opposition Benches, we have now about 6 million properties. If we compare that with 1961, we find that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is in charge of a hell of a lot more council housing than her Conservative predecessors. I looked at the number of council house lettings and was surprised to find that the figure is still running at some 450,000 a year. That is also a very high level. I do not know whether my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is aware that she has one of the best records in charge of council housing of any Conservative Prime Minister since the war. I am not sure that that was her objective, but it is true. The accusation by the Opposition that fewer houses are being built will not stick either. I listened with the greatest care to the hon. Member for Hammersmith. He talked about some of these little leaflets being incomplete. I hesitate to suggest that he is a bit incomplete, Madam Deputy Speaker, because you might rule that that was a little unparliamentary, but he certainly picked some incomplete statistics. His figures, for example, for the number of houses being built started at 1980. If we start at 1979, when we took power, we find that the number of public starts was 81,000 and the number of private starts was 144,000, giving us a total of 225,000 starts. In 1987, the number of public starts was 32,000 and the number of private starts 191,000, giving virtually the same total, 223,000.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,94,housing,418

Member for Hammersmith may shake his head, but I got these figures not from the Government but from the House of Commons Library. My hon. Friend who will answer the debate may have more up-to-date information, as the figures in the Library are for only the first nine months of 1988, but if we gross up those figures for the whole year, we arrive not at 225,000-the figure for 1979-and not 223,000-the figure for 1987-but 240,000 in a full year for 1988. The simple fact is that we are not building fewer houses. Taking the two together, public and private, we are building roughly the same number. It is certainly true to say that public sector new build has fallen. It has been falling for years-and a jolly good thing too. In 1979, there were 81,000 public sector starts; in 1987, there were only 31,000. But if we go back to the first year of the Labour Government of which I believe the hon. Member for Hammersmith was a very proud member, 1974, the figure was 146,000, an enormously larger number than they finished with in 1979. We all had the pleasure tonight of watching him standing there wriggling, a little embarrassed, a little ashamed, at the Dispatch Box, saying that he was not too proud of the housing record of the last Labour Government-and absolutely right. There are three reasons why the Labour Government did not build council houses-whatever their policy was, they did not do it. First, they could not afford it. Secondly, it was not needed. The slum clearance programmes of the post-war period were coming to an end. We had shifted 1Â·5 million households and it was no longer necessary to do that kind of clearance. Thirdly, it was not wanted. People do not want council housing. They want their own houses, and the Labour party now belatedly recognises this. Nobody has mentioned tonight the quality of the housing stock. There is a lot more of it, and it is a lot sounder than it has ever been in the nation's history. I am told that there are five basic amenities-an inside loo, a fixed bath in the bathroom, a wash basin, a sink and hot and cold water at three points. If we take the number of properties in England and Wales that lack those amenities, we find that over the past 20 years, despite a widening of the definition of these basic amenities, the proportion of the dwelling stock lacking one or more such facilities has fallen from 25 per cent. to under 3 per cent.-that is, fewer than three homes in 100. I would like to bet that most of them are in the areas covered by Labour councils. Renovation of property is something that I was very keen to do in the city of Birmingham. We had enveloping schemes and we did our best to ensure that people could live where they wanted, in the homes that they wanted to live in, and that those homes were in good order. In the live years under Labour, 1974 to 1979-these are not incomplete statistics, and I have taken them again from the Library-over 160,000 houses a year on average were improved. In the past five years, an average of over 440,000 have been improved every year. Our homes are i n better nick than they have ever been and that is because people want to stay in their own homes and they want advice and assistance and support to improve them. That is what we have been doing. Of course, the hon. Members on the Opposition Benches used to build their council houses. They are welcome to them. The fact is that they built dismal, damp dumps-they have already been called "" concrete jungles"" twice-more tatty tenements, more miserable places, more tower blocks named after the Labour chairmen of the housing committees-and people do not want them. They did not want them then and they do not want them now. Nobody wants to live in those grotty estates that were built in those years. People want to live in modern, private houses, put up by private builders who have an eye to the: market, an eye to the customers and what the customers want. When people had no choice, Labour built them junk. They expected them to be grateful. Now people have some choice and they do not want to live in those houses any more.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,96,housing,745

I look forward to the day when more councils will do what Solihull has just done and pull those properties down. That is what the tenants really want. I want to make two more points, the first of which concerns mortgage rates. Again, I went to the Library and looked up the figures. Incidentally, as has been mentioned, this is something of a re-run debate. The first one was supposed to be held in Opposition time. I happened to see the original motion in the Table Office-it just happened to be lying there when I went in one day. The people who worded it cannot spell "" mortgage""; the Table Office had to put it right. Anyway, I looked up the interest rates at the time the Labour party was in government and hon. Members opposite were Housing Ministers. In only one year, very briefly in 1978-what about this for cynicism?-was the mortgage rate in single figures. Almost the whole time the Labour party was in power the mortgage rate was over 11 per cent. Indeed, it stood at 12 per cent. in May 1979, just before the election. In those days it was a fixed rate; there was no shopping around. The banks were not giving loans to ordinary people, and borrowers did not have the opportunity that now exists to shop around for the best bargain or for whatever suited them. I give the Chancellor my full support in his efforts to stabilise the housing market. The rapid house price inflation that we saw last year was unhelpful to everyone. No one could support or argue in favour of it. And it was aggravated by lower interest rates. Heaven only knows why, the moment interest rates go into single figures, everybody in this country thinks that it is a green light. Nobody in West Germany thinks that an interest rate of 9 per cent. is low. People there do not behave like that, but we in this country do. Well, so long as we think that as soon as the interest rate reached 9 per cent, we should borrow enormous amounts of money that we cannot afford, interest rates will have to stay where they are. The Labour party should come clean about one topic that it has mentioned. The hon. Members for Hammersmith and for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) talked about mortgage interest tax relief, did they not? They talked about how much it costs, did they not? They should tell us whether they are going to abolish mortgage interest tax relief. They should come clean and say, "" We do not like mortgage interest tax relief, and we are going to abolish it."" They should say that that will be in their manifesto for the next election.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,102,housing,497
1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],297,Edwina Currie,Con,False,"The hon. Gentleman has already had a go; it is my turn now. The Labour party should come absolutely clean about mortgage interest tax relief. Hon. Members opposite should say that they do not like it and that they are going to abolish it, and that should be in their manifesto. If, however, they recognise that mortgate interest tax relief helps many people to get on to the housing ladder for the first time, and that it is welcomed by those people, particularly by people in constituencies like mine, they should stop criticising it and admit that it is a good thing. My final comment concerns a thought for the future. As my hon. Friend the Minister will have realised by now, I am totally in favour of the Government's housing policies. We in this country are extremely lucky to have a Government who run the economy in such a way that we can all afford to buy our homes, a Government who are organising planning legislation in such a way that land will be released. That is happening in areas such as mine, and we are seeing growth. But I offer my hon. Friend one thought for the next 10 years of Conservative Government, the next 10 years we will be in power. One quarter of all households consist of single people, most of them elderly. Nearly 3 million old ladies live alone. Another third of all households consist of two people, mostly older couples whose children have grown up and gone away. We are talking about a large number of old people. When we think ahead and take into account the fact that single person households are expected to increase from the current total of 5Â·25 million to over 7 million by the year 2001-and that will be nearly one third of all households-I wonder whether it is right that so many builders are continuing to build three, four and five-bedroom houses with double garages and no granny flat. For certain, by the end of another 10 years or so we will find that the crying shortage, unless there is a response to this need, will be in property that is suitable for elderly people, particularly those living alone. We will know that we have made progress on this issue when the price of bungalows is lower than the price of houses, not higher, as at present. However, I shall leave that thought for my hon. Friends. I congratulate the Government on the tremendous improvement that we have seen in the nation's housing, and I look forward to further progress.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,103,housing,432

Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) has managed to trump it. In preparing for this debate, I took the trouble to read not various statistics-we all know how statistics can be juggled-but the debate that took place on 23 May 1988. The comments that were made then have been repeated today, and I am very sad that it should be so. On both occasions, despite the smugness of what the Government had to say, the message that came through-it is a message which must not be lost among the arguments about the Local Government and Housing Bill and about mortgage interest rates-was that the devastating impact of the continued policy of restricting expenditure on the development of public housing in all its forms is having an immediate and sustained effect on those people in most need of help with housing. I rang both local authorities in my area-Carrick and Restormel-a few weeks ago, and the message from them was abundantly clear: "" Allow us to spend our money to house our homeless."" Not only are local authorities not given that freedom; they are now hampered by rising land prices, even in areas that are relatively poor, such as my own. If a district council like Restormel owns very little land, there is no way in which, with current restrictions, it can outbid private investors. In a recent sale of some land in Newquay, a private developer was able not simply to outbid the local authority by a small amount but actually to double what the council could afford to bid. That local authority has very little land of its own and is therefore hamstrung in attempting to meet the needs of its people. Another message has started to come through from my county, and it is echoed in many other parts of the country, not only by councils but by people who come to my surgery and, no doubt, people who consult other hon. Members. They are asking what the point is of a housing allocation list. I understand that councillors in Caradon have gone so far as to suggest that their housing allocations sub-committee should be wound up because there is no longer any such thing as an empty property. As soon as a property in council hands is vacated it goes straight to a homeless family because, as a result of the right to buy, the council no longer has properties for families at the top of the housing allocation list. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, South said-I think that I quote her exactly-"" People do not want council housing.- I think it is fair to say that people's ultimate ambition is probably to own their homes, but in the case of very many who come to see me, it is not a question of their "" not"" wanting council housing but of their desperate need for any kind of roof over their heads. When they are told that they will have to live for years in caravans that are damp, smelly. small, unclean and unhygienic, and where, when they are in the bathroom, they can see the land outside, between the floor and the walls, it is no surprise that they are unable to understand why the Government will not put money into providing houses for them.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,105,housing,574

I allowed her to intervene, because she has not done so before, but I shall have to rein in other right hon. and hon. Members, because time is short. The Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association says that the Government should relax current restrictions on the spending of local authority capital receipts. It comments: "" the fundamental requirement is to increase the supply of permanent housing."" Seen in that context, the fact that the Secretary of State presides over a housing budget that is the only departmental budget to contribute to the Treasury is one of bitter irony for the homeless. All that profit has been made possible by council house sales and at the expense of the homeless. People are making their beds out on the streets tonight, as they did last night, and will do again tomorrow night, and the night after that. People are out on the streets because they have no housing. For the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South to say that people do not want council housing is painful for them, and shows no understanding of the conditions that people must endure. It speaks volumes about middle class, suburban ambitions, but nothing about the reality of the very many people who cannot hope to realise those ambitions. The recent report of the Audit Commission, "" Housing the homeless: The local authority role"", made many recommendations, and one point that comes through loud and clear is the continuing need for local authorities to play a role. I hope that Ministers accept the report's argument that there is a strong case for taking greater account of homelessness in the allocation by the Government of resources to local authorities. Many of the areas hardest hit by homelessness are not in inner cities but in rural areas. One reason for that is that wealthier, luckier people are fulfilling their ambition to own property and to retire to what, to them, is a lovely part of the country-but to others it is their home and was their parents' home, but can no longer offer them work and, as a result, they cannot afford to buy houses. I refer also to areas where people are buying second homes in beautiful and lovely countryside. It is a pity that people wishing to move to them do not see the poverty of the families living next door, because families who have lived in those villages for years cannot now afford homes there. I give as evidence of that the almost ideal example of a young couple in Cornwall, wishing to make a start on the housing ladder. If they both work, both receive the county's average wage for their sex, and have no children-one can hardly imagine a better scenario for first-time buyers-they can, according to local building societies, afford just 2 per cent. of the housing stock that is for sale at any one time. Needless to say, that stock is not in the areas where they want to buy, even if they are lucky enough to track it down before it is sold. That 2 per cent. of the housing stock is to be found in the larger conurbations, in the more rundown areas of high unemployment. Young couples living in villages scattered throughout my constituency and others have no chance of buying a home in their birthplace or workplace. A prime example of the Government's response has been the transfer of council stock. For us, one of the most glaring examples is Torbay. Giving council tenants a greater say in what happens has potential, but when the Government exploit that situation, and cloak it in a rigged electoral system of secrecy and misinformation, council tenants naturally grow suspicious and do not feel that they have been made a genuine offer. The only convincing argument for the negative voting system is that under it the constituency of the Secretary of State for the Environment-Cirencester and Tewkesbury-would have fallen to the Liberals at the last election. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would not think that such a system would be appropriate if it were to have that result for him. When that rigged electoral system for Torbay was overthrown by the Secretary of State under pressure from local Democrat councillors-who collected a petition showing that most people were against the transfer, despite the negative voting claim to the contrary-it was not just an attack on the Tory councillors who attempted to implement that system but, above all, a clear and visible attack on the negative voting system itself. Basically, the Secretary of State told the Tory councillors in Torbay that they had run the system as he had told them to do, but that the system was not right. It is only a shame that the right hon. Gentleman does not recognise the value of extending his decision more generally. Council tenants throughout the country are concerned about who will manage their homes. There is great anxiety among tenants of the Commission for the New Towns about the future ownership and management of their homes. I cite Basildon as one example. Can the Minister give an assurance that there will be a ballot for CNT tenants on the future ownership and management of their homes before any changes occur? That is what tenants are pressing for.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,107,housing,891

1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],303,Matthew Taylor,LibDem,False,"I reject absolutely the hon. Gentleman's remarks. Our councillors and supporters have tried only to inform, and to argue that tenants should have a genuine say in the transfer of their housing stock. I may add that they have not supported the Labour party in seeking ballot after ballot, because they would like to see matters properly and independently conducted. Will the Minister consider giving CNT tenants wishing to buy their own homes the same level of grant and subsidy that he intends giving any housing associations that are interested in CNT stock? If so, that might provide a fair balance and proper choice. The young are among those most affected by Tory housing policy. In April 1988, the Government introduced income support regulations that created different levels of income support for 16 and 17-year-olds, for 18 to 24-year-olds, and for 25-year-olds. Household levels of income support were abolished, with the consequence that benefit levels no longer reflect the additional costs involved when a young person has no choice but to live away from his or her parents' home. Earlier, I spoke of middle-class suburban values. Another is the assumption that parents can always be relied upon to support their children. For too many young people, that is not the case. Due to the alignment of income support allowances and housing benefit allowances, young people not only receive less help in meeting their personal costs but, if they are on a YTS or are unemployed, receive less help than older people with paying their rent and rates. I have never heard a convincing argument for why that should be, other than that which the Government does not like to articulate, which is that parents are always there, ready and willing to pick up the tab. That is not the case. Since April 1988, income support has been payable two weeks in arrears, and the Department of Social Security no longer provides deposits to help people to secure accommodation. People needing money in an emergency must now apply for a discretionary loan, which young people in particular are not guaranteed to obtain. Linked with those changes was a Government promise of a YTS place for every young person who wanted one. The Government have been unable to keep that promise. On 9 November last year, the Government admitted that more than 13,000 young people looking for a YTS place had not been found one. As the Government should be aware, that means that those young people are ineligible for any form of benefit support. They increasingly face homelessness and the risk of destitution. They do not even appear in the figures of the homeless, but go unwanted and unrecognised. Recently, I received a letter from a Methodist minister who picked up on those changes, and who wrote asking how such a thing could be. He wrote: "" Whilst my wife was in St. Austell this morning, she came across a young woman begging outside Tesco, displaying a sign reading, 'I have no work and no money-please can you spare 10p?' This young woman-she is around 18 to 20-had left a catering course after two years and had come to this area seeking work. She has accommodation in a `bed-sit', but is caught in some sort of 'waiting period' until she becomes eligible to draw benefit. She is actively seeking work but, meantime, has no means of support-hence her begging. No doubt this will concern you as it does me, the more so with the temptations which may well come the way of a young woman in this situation. If the present Social Security regulations really are causing such a situation, then they urgently need amending."" They are causing such situations, especially for those who are not even offered a YTS place or who are without a family to turn to. The smug, complacent attitude of the Minister and the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South shocked me. It showed no recognition not only of the political propaganda that the Minister has to face in the House, but of the political reality of young people who have no hope of a house of their own or the Minister who wrote to me describing the young lady begging in the street in St. Austell. That attitude does not recognise the people who cannot afford to pay the mortgage on the houses for which they have scraped together the money to buy on the Government's recommendation. It does not recognise the people in pleasant towns and villages who see the devastating impact that neglect is having on those who have always lived there. If the Minister had said that the Government were trying to do what they could, but that they recognised the failings and that more needed to be done, that would be one thing. But the Minister gives the impression that he honestly believes that there is nothing wrong, that no more needs doing, that everything about the Government's policy is right, that there is no omission and no improvement possible. That makes me angry because it shows a fundamental unwillingness to face up to the realities for people today. I hope that as the Minister reads the reports of this debate and the reports from many different organisations, he will reflect that he was wrong after all to take the attitude he has shown today.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,109,housing,893

Friends do not think that everything is right, but he is wrong when he says that everything is wrong. My hon. Friends are more realistic about their record of achievement. However, they have achieved a tremendous amount in comparatively few years. No doubt that achievement will continue. I want to return to the subject of inner cities and the area that I represent in inner London, and to comment on some of the achievements and some of the problems waiting to be resolved. This Government of all Governments have accepted the major challenge to provide a better quality of life for people living in urban areas. The problems in accepting that challenge are considerable. Areas such as Wandsworth face the major problem of dealing with the designers and planners of the past and with vast numbers of high-rise dwellings. The high-rise dwellings of former Socialist administrations in Wandsworth have resulted, 10 or 20 years later, in the crime, deprivation and isolation that we see today and there are mammoth problems to be overcome. Such problems affect families and communities because we have areas in which people feel that they do not know each other and in which they feel that they can no longer send their children out to play with other families and know that they are safe. They have either to keep their children indoors or let them go out, where they pick up bad habits from their role models who are, of course, older children. Sadly, we cannot pull down those tower blocks because that would be too expensive a solution, but we can remedy the problem. If we had been able to pull down the tower blocks, we would have been able to house the same number of people on the same area of land in terraced houses with gardens and we should have kept the communities that we have lost. That is a major problem, and in trying to solve it we have other problems. In my area, there is a paucity of land available for development. That is not true of all areas, but it is true of my part of inner London. In some areas the Land Registry can help in identifying and releasing land for development, but not in mine. We also have the continuing problem of social change. We have higher rates of divorce, young people leave home earlier, there are more single parents and more people coming out of institutions and looking for accommodation in society. I salute the Government's achievements, which have been many. An enormous amount has been achieved through the Estate Action programme, for example. Hon. Members need not take my word for it.

1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],307,John Bowis,Con,False,"Park Court is one of the blocks on the Doddington estate which is being completely refurbished so that it can be offered back to the tenants who resided there. It can also he offered to people on the waiting list. Some homes will be for rent and some for purchase. In refurbishing those homes, the council will bring new life into the estate. Alongside that redevelopment is low-rise development with landscaping and all the other amenities that enable one to achieve a more popular and habitable living area in a high-rise estate. I do not apologise for that. There has been an enormous achievements, in crime prevention. Hon. Members need not take my word for it. They can come and see the partnership in Wandsworth between the Government, the Department of the Environment and the Home Office and the crime prevention measures that have led to new areas of lighting, locks, ground floor gardens and the moving of walkways. We know what needs to be done in Wandsworth, and we have a good example of partnership there. Tremendous strides have been made on sheltered accommodation and home improvements throughout the borough. We have seen the enormous achievement of home ownership. Three million more families nationally own their homes than in 1979. Locally, 12,500 council dwellings have moved into private ownership, including 3,500 council flats. Half have gone to sitting tenants and half to people on the waiting list. That is an enormous list of achievements, of which the Government can be proud, although I believe that there is a long way to go on home ownership. We still have more nationalised housing than anywhere else in Europe, but the Government are freeing people from being locked into dependency on tenancy, whereas Labour Governments have sought to perpetuate that. We still have particular problems in inner London. We have the problem of empty properties, and other hon. Members have referred to the problem of empty council properties. I shall not dwell on that except to say that the Government are moving to rectify that. There are still problems in the private sector, and we should not under-estimate them. If private sector properties are empty for a period of years, perhaps we should consider trusts taking them over and letting them. We should consider the question of squatting. Squatters jump the queue over more deserving people on the waiting list. The definition of homelessness needs to be considered. There are far too many cases in my constituency of people who suffer overcrowding, such as five people living in one-bedroomed accommodation, people in accommodation that needs repair, and disabled people who live upstairs and cannot get out. They are being jumped over by people who are defined as homeless and who, for one reason or another, seem to be able to reach the top of the list ahead of others. Sometimes that may be justified, but too often it is not. The other day I received a letter from a constituent which asked the following question: ""18 months ago, my sister got pregnant-she then moved (almost straightaway) into a three bedroomed council flat ... Shall I get pregnant and do things the wrong way round? Will that help my chances?"" That is not the message that we should give young people in need of housing. Such an attitude is true of too many housing associations. I received a letter from a couple in which the young man was training for the ministry. They have been told that they must wait until either they are married or living together. They said that they did not want to live together. The Peabody Trust said: "" The criterion the Trust has recently adopted in this respect is that couples approaching us must either be married or must show a commitment to the relationship in the form of being already living together."" That is not the answer that we should be giving to young people who wish to "" do it the right way"". There is one injustice that the Government have not yet put right. Housing associations are central to the Government's housing plans. When they are good, they are excellent but when they are poor they can be tyrannical. We must try not to set a new trap that will prevent people from owning their own homes. My mailbag is full of letters from constituents saying, "" The Government have given the option of home ownership to council tenants. Why cannot I have it? I have lived in a housing association property for the past 20 years. My family have grown up in it and I have spent thousands on improving it, yet I am not allowed the right to buy it."" Others write and say, "" The council has just moved me into a housing association property for its own convenience, and nobody told me that I would lose the right to buy."" That behaviour is unjustified. As we bring in more housing association properties to help solve problems of housing and homelessness, more and more people will fall into that trap unless we give them the right to buy their housing association property. I hope that no hon. Member will try to tell me about tenants transfer discounts of Home Ownership for Tenants of Charitable Housing Associations. HOTCHA was not so hot, and TIS-the tenants' incentive scheme-is a 'tisn't in London, given that the average price of a council flat after discount is Â£15,000 while the average after a TIS is between Â£50,000 and Â£70,000. For Londoners TIS ain't on. I beg my right hon. and hon. Friends to reconsider this matter. Increasingly, housing associations are funded by the taxpayer and the ratepayer, and we therefore have a right to tell them how that money should be spent. It should be spent on providing rented accommodation, from which people can eventually step on to the home ownership ladder by exercising the right to buy. We need also to consider the possibility of allocating a quarter or a third of housing association funds with specific strings attached, insisting that properties should be provided for equity sharing schemes so that the sons and daughters of those who exercise the right to buy can climb up a stage on the home ownership ladder.

1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],308,Eric Heffer,Lab,False,"One of the saddest things about this debate has been the repudiation, not only by the Minister but by Conservative Back Benchers, of the previous policies of the Conservative party. Public housing did not begin with a Labour Government-not even with John Wheatley, whose Housing Act 1924 led to the building of about 500,000 houses. Public housing began before that, and was determined by the needs of the people. Let us consider the history of Parliament from 1915 onwards. Perhaps the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Boscawen) is related to Griffith-Boscawen who said, "" If it is right to have public education and public roads, why should it be wrong to have housing built by the state and by local authorities on behalf of people in need?"" He was absolutely right to argue that case. Some hon. Members who have appeared on the Conservative Benches during the last couple of Parliaments do not seem to understand their own history. Some of them have never heard of Joseph Chamberlain or of others in their ranks who argued consistently over the years that local authorities and the state should play a positive role in meeting the needs of the people. They seem not to know that, and that is a great pity. Perhaps they should look into their own history. I was born and bred in a very small town. I was not born in Liverpool; I went there later, during the war years, and settled there after the war. I was born in Hertford, which is 20 miles north of London and had a population of 12,000. Even in that small community, we had council houses and council estates. I can name some of them. There was Gallows Hill estate-admittedly not a very good name-and there was the Bengeo estate, through which I passed on my two-mile walk to the church school. My mother insisted that I went to the church school. There were other estates in that small town. I sometimes compare the lot of those who lived in council houses with the circumstances in which we lived. Our accommodation was damp, and my brother got TB and died at the age of 21. Others like us lived in dreadful conditions with mould on the walls, and the private landlords did nothing for people. The council houses were wonderful in comparison. I then went to the great city of Liverpool. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie) is not here. She knows what I mean when I call her "" luv"", because it is a Liverpool expression. In some parts of the country it would be "" duck"" and in Cornwall, for example, it would be "" dear"". My remark was not a sexist remark but a Liverpool remark, and I want to put that on record in case people write to me and say, "" My God, what a sexist thing to say."" The hon. Lady and I both come from the city of Liverpool. I have lived there since the end of the war and my wife was born and bred there, on the Norris Green estate, a working-class housing estate. People used to pray that they would get to live in such a place. When my mother-in-law moved from rooms into a house-the house in which she still lives and in which she brought up her family-she took with her a handcart with the few odds and ends that she had; she did not have any furniture. Conservative Members say that people do not want council housing. It is all right for the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South. She was born round the corner from where I now live. She would not know what living in council housing meant to people. I do, although I have never lived in one. As it happens, I have been an owner-occupier since the end of the war. First I lived in rooms and then I saved up to get a mortgage. I know that millions of people in this country have benefited from living in council housing and that they have been able to live a decent life because of it. People are worried sick about the Government's new housing proposals. They do not know what will happen to them or whether their house will be handed over to some other landlord. I do not know what the leaflets say, but I know that my constituents write to me expressing concern, not because they have received leaflets but because all their lives they have lived happily in those houses. Of course people want decent houses. They want their repairs done and they want their houses properly looked after and modernised-as many of them have been looked after and modernised by local authorities. I urge hon. Members to visit my mother-in-law's street. It is easy to tell the council houses from the ones that have been bought: the ones that have been bought are running down because people cannot afford to keep them in proper order. That is what is happening. The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) may laugh, but I challenge him to come to Liverpool and look at all the houses that people have bought but are being repossessed because they cannot afford to meet the mortgage repayments. It may be different in other parts of the country.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,114,housing,898

If we are to discuss these matters, we should be really concerned about them. I shall conclude by quoting some figures. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, South also used figures. According to the Department of Environment housing and construction statistics published in October 1988, a total of 81,099 local authority houses were started in 1977. In 1979 the figure was 47,465, but by 1988 the figure had fallen to 15,204. Those are not my figures; they are the Department's figures. I can also quote other figures, such as those relating to the homeless. A recent written reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) shows that, at the end of June 1979, only seven local authorities had over 20 and up to 50 homeless households requiring bed-and-breakfast accommodation. By the end of March 1988, a total of 26 towns and cities had more than 20 homeless households. The position is becoming worse. I do not have time to quote all the facts and figures, but the housing crisis still exists. It is worse than it has ever been for ordinary working people, especially in London. Where do ordinary working people in London live? From where can they get housing? There are not even the rooms that used to exist. That is why there is such a rise in the number of homeless. We have to do something about it. The only solution is to get rid of the Government's policies. I hope that when a Labour Government are elected, we shall tackle the housing crisis for the first time. I believe passionately that no Government have really dealt with it properly. Like many workers among the Opposition, I know about living in lousy, rotten conditions and it is about time that it was stopped once and for all.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,117,housing,319
1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],312,George Young,Con,False,"I am grateful to the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) for curtailing his remarks. I would not contradict what he said about his constituency, but in Ealing the position is reversed. The council houses that have been bought are well maintained, and the houses owned by the council are vandalised, squatted in and left empty for too long. I shall address my brief remarks to the housing pressures in London and the south-east. Many of the symptoms have already been referred to-house prices increasing two and a half times in the past 10 years, rising faster than incomes; sadly more families accepted as homeless; young people sleeping on the streets; and problems in recruiting professionals such as teachers and nurses in London. There are also many concealed households, as young people stay with their parents because home ownership or renting is not available. I very much welcome all that the Government have done to improve the position, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on what he is doing to reduce voids in local authority stock, to reclaim and use derelict land, to get the urban development corporations to provide affordable housing and to turn round difficult-to-let estates through Estate Action. More power to his elbow, but even if all that is done, there will still be a housing shortage in London and the south-east that can be met only by building more houses. Even SERPLAN, which is notoriously conservative, has now agreed that by 2001 100,000 to 120,000 dwellings will be needed in addition o those already planned. I want to rebut the view that the answer to our problems in the south-east is to adhere to a strict planning regime and simply hope that development will take place elsewhere. I welcome the economic revival of the north, and the confident statements from the business community and its civic leaders are music to our ears-our strategy must be to build on that-but it is important not to dismantle or destabilise the economic base of the south-east and, crucially, not to enforce the relocation of residents from the overcrowded south to the north. Some of my hon. Friends wish to hang up a "" house full"" sign on the door of the south-east, tightly to restrict further development and let the market do the rest. I find such a solution unacceptable. It is certainly unacceptable to the DTI. In its evidence to the public inquiry into proposalls for a new country town at Foxley Wood, the DTI was provoked into saying: "" Past policies of discouraging development in relatively prosperous locations, or even steering that development to other parts of the country, have not met with success. It would therefore be a mistake to interfere with market forces by putting protective barriers around the south-east and other desirable areas in the hope that this would open up opportunities elsewhere."" We are a party that responds to market forces. We believe in reading the signals given by the market, and the policy of freezing development in the south-east is the very negation of what we stand for. The transformation of the country's economy has been achieved through acting on the supply side, finding out where the bottlenecks are, and removing restrictive practices by trade unions, anti-competitive agreements and the rest. The housing market cannot be expected to work with one hand tied behind its back. What happens to the nurses, the teachers and the postmen who live and work in the south-east? As we have heard, local authorities are increasingly committed to rehousing the homeless, and those people often cannot afford to buy at the moment, let alone if the restrictive policies advocated by some people are pursued. The communities that would result from such policies would be unbalanced, polarised and unstable. The social cement that binds us together would not exist. We would have only the prosperous and the poor, and the children of people in the south-east would have real problems in finding somewhere to live. Our strategic objective should be to manage and exploit the economic strengths of the south-east for the benefit of its residents and the rest of the United Kingdom. We need more houses. The rapid rise in land prices in England and Wales has increased fivefold in the past 10 years. Much of the land that has become available has not gone to the groups that most need housing, so there has been a mismatch between the type and location of new housing and the reasonable expectations and aspirations of local people. That is an understandable reason why planning committees can turn down development applications because they do not consider them relevant to local needs. No one can argue that the land does not exist. Between now and the end of the century, 20 per cent. of agricultural land will become redundant-much of it in the areas of housing shortage. Farmers have already applied for 150,000 acres to go into the set-aside scheme. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has made it clear that change of use is needed. At the Conservative party conference in 1987, he said: "" We must accept that more land will have to come out of agricultural production. So we must facilitate this change, to the benefit of our rural areas, and not obstruct it."" I see no reason for us to turn our backs on the one form of development that is most urgently needed-homes. At the moment, the planning system cannot cope. Farmers and landowners have to play rustic roulette. They either get planning permission and their land is worth Â£1 million an acre, or they do not and it is worth Â£1,000 an acre. If they get consent, the developer will maximise his profit by building high-value units often beyond the reach of local pockets. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West (Sir J. Spicer) that we need a halfway stage-to give planning permission if the land is sold at a realistic price, which means that properties can be bought or rented by people on average incomes, and if the properties are offered in the first instance to local people doing key work or to the children of those already living in the community. Many reasons for opposing development are based on sheer selfishness. The secretary of the village conservation society is often the chap who bought the last Wimpey house on the site of the old village school. He is often advocating restrictive development policies which, had they been adopted a few years back, would have meant that the house in which he now lives would never have been built. Other motives are more defensible, but one can overcome the understandable unhappiness of local people by insisting on a higher quality of design and on planning gain, so that there is real advantage to local communities if development goes ahead. Many of the issues that I have raised fall outside my hon. Friend's brief, although they fall within his Department. I hope that, as a party, we can approach the subject in the spirit that I have outlined and come up with solutions in keeping with our party's broad sympathy to respond to and harness the forces of the market-solutions made more urgent by a humane desire to see our people adequately housed.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,118,housing,1228
1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],313,Paul Murphy,Lab,False,"The debate has been wide, but I shall confine my remarks to housing in Wales. When we look, as we must, at the result of the Government's housing policy in Wales, we see that there is no doubt that the problems that have been highlighted by my right hon. and hon. Friends are even worse in the Principality. Wales has the oldest housing stock in Britain. Of all its houses, 40 per cent. were built before the first world war. Despite the fact that the Government have done some work to improve the condition of those houses, their own house condition survey admitted that about Â£500 million is still necessary to put right the houses in the Principality. Welsh district councils have said that they need more money for environmental schemes and more grants for low-paid owner-occupiers to carry out urgent repairs. Low-cost houses are important in the valleys and elsewhere in Wales. The staggering rise in private house prices during the past year is more obvious in Wales than elsewhere. There was a 52 per cent. rise in private house prices in Wales in the past year. That is more than in any other region. It is more than in London, where prices rose by about 15 per cent., and in the country as a whole, where prices have risen by about 31 per cent. We have seen widespread gazumping in the Principality. The Prime Minister tells us that private industry and estate agents should work out their own solutions to gazumping. That is not the answer to a major problem in England and Wales. High interest rates and low salaries in Wales mean that young people cannot afford new houses. The only people in Wales who can afford new houses are those who come in from elsewhere and are second, third, or even fourth-time buyers. That fact must be contrasted with the lack of local authority housing. One of the most staggering remarks in the debate came from the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie). She said that no one actually wants council houses any more. I wish that she would say that to the 70,000 people who are on waiting lists in Wales or to the other people throughout Britain who badly require housing. In the years of this Government, 60,000 council houses in Wales have been sold, and 30,000 more are planned to be sold. The rate in Cardiff is 73 sales a week. The housing supply is effectively drying up. In 1975, a total of 8,000 houses were built in the Principality. Last year, 900 were built, and they were mainly specialist housing. In some district council areas in Wales it takes up to 10 years before people can get the council house which the hon. Lady said they do not actually want. In the past 10 years, there has been a 174 per cent. increase in rents in Wales. The traditional supplier of houses in Wales is the local authority, but people cannot now look to their local authorities for housing. If the hon. Lady has her way, they will never be able to. It is wrong to talk of councils in Wales and the rest of Britain building only bad, decrepit housing. That is by no means the case. Local authorities stuck stringently to the Parker Morris standards. This Government relaxed those standards. Council houses were often better built than private houses. Housing associations are now seen as the panacea for housing problems in Wales and Britain. The public expenditure White Paper states that they are the main providers of social housing. The organisation Housing in Wales has been created for that purpose. It is elected by nobody and is accountable to no one, save the Secretary of State himself. Its very creation is a slap in the face for local authorities in Wales, with all the experience that they have gained over the years in providing houses for our people. The Â£72 million that that body has been given should have been given to councils to put right their stock and to build houses, as they have been doing over the decades. Housing associations will not provide the answer to social housing problems. Rents will rise through decontrol or the replacement of secure or assured tenancies, and the need for market rents. Those who are just above the housing benefit eligibility level will be caught in a poverty trap. Housing associations in Wales provide houses for people. A recent survey undertaken by the associations showed that one in five families in housing associations earn less than Â£40 a week and that only a handful earn over Â£100 a week. How will the associations deal with the problem of single, young people in Wales and elsewhere who cannot afford mortgages? There has been a rise in homelessness, the extent of which is more staggering than we have seen for many years. There has been a 100 per cent. rise in 10 years. Six thousand people in the Principality are now homeless, and that is not counting those who are regarded as homeless but are not in the official figures. Matters have been made worse by a rise in rent arrears and mortgage defaults. It is no wonder that the Audit Commission said that some councils will be unable to meet their legal requirements. What of the future? The Secretary of State for Wales has provided an answer. He wants to give away council houses altogether. That is a dotty idea. It is as absurd as it is impractical. It has been universally condemned by every Welsh housing association and other housing bodies. The impartial South Wales Argus called it political engineering of the most sinister kind. Public housing stock in Wales and Britain as a whole would be destroyed at a stroke if the Goverment's proposals were put into operation. The Secretary of State's statement has more to do with internal Tory party politics than with the proper provision of housing in Britain. There is no doubt that housing in Wales is at a crisis point. First-time buyers cannot afford to buy. There are fewer and fewer houses to rent. Housing association rents will rise dramatically. The financial future for housing is bleak, with housing revenue accounts not to be helped any more by rates. That will fall heavily on pensioner schemes. There has been an effective cut in housing figures over the past 10 years. Wales has lost Â£1Â·25 billion in housing money which should have come to it over the last decade. Housing in Wales is a time bomb which the Government must defuse. Ministers should plan for a balanced provision between rented and private housing. Instead, all that we are offered is the jungle of the free market which will no more solve Wales's housing needs than Britain's housing needs.",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,119,housing,1141
1989-03-02,Housing [Adjournment (Easter) > Bill Presented],314,Christopher Chope,Con,False,"I will not be able to reply to all the points made by the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) and I hope he will forgive me for not entering into the details of Welsh housing. There was a full debate on Welsh issues yesterday. The hon. Gentleman did not make proper reference to the Welsh house condition survey. The latest survey shows that significantly fewer houses in Wales are now unfit. The proportion of houses without basic amenities has almost halved since 1981 and many fewer houses are now in a state of disrepair. These improvements have been particularly marked in areas such as Gwent, where unfitness has more than halved since 1981 and is now well below the Welsh average. I suspect-without having detailed knowledge of circumstances in Wales-that much of what the hon. Member for Torfaen said exaggerated the problems in Wales. We have had a lively debate with some excellent contributions, especially from my hon. Friends. We particularly welcome the contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie). She commanded the attention of the House, she spoke with knowledge and experience as a former chairman of Birmingham city housing committee and she made some well-researched and telling points which caused confusion among the Opposition. I hope that she continues to speak out on the important subject of housing. We also had important contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Dorset, West (Sir J. Spicer), for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) and for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), and I hope that I shall have time to respond at least to some of the points that they made. A common strand that has run through all speeches has been that more houses must be made available either through better management or through new building In the pressure spots, be they in London, the south-east or elsewhere. But before we can have more houses, we must have the land on which to put them, and that is where the planning system comes in. That issue was addressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Dorset, West and for Ealing, Acton and, in an intervention, by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell), who said that restricting housing land led to a consequential increase in the cost of that land and, therefore, house prices. The latest household projection clearly shows that more housing will be needed in the next decade, not so much because of any population increase as because of the increased rate at which the existing population forms new households. The reasons for that are many. The fact that elderly people are living longer, the increasing divorce rate, the growth of one-parent families and the fact that young people are leaving home earlier are all contributory factors. Some say that the new demand for housing should be accommodated within the existing urban areas, as a means of taking pressure off the countryside, especially green field sites, and to encourage urban regeneration. They are right. That should happen as far as possible, but it is impractical to expect all new demand to be absorbed by our older urban areas. We are doing as much as we can to encourage the process. Urban development corporations, enterprise zones, simplified planning zones and the financial incentives offered by city grant and derelict land grant are already doing much to rehabilitate urban areas by encouraging new enterprises, new homes and new jobs. But cities need their open spaces, too. It is not the business of the planning system to direct people where they should live-to cram them into towns when that is not where they want to live-which is not only immoral but self-defeating. We need more housing in areas outside the. major conurbations. Too often, development plans propose new enterprises and new jobs because of the prosperity they bring, but shun the new homes that are vital to go with them, or hope that neighbouring areas will accommodate them. That is often referred to as the "" not in my back yard"" philosophy. People who support that philosophy fail to realise that increasingly they will be unable to recruit the skilled labour that their businesses need because the price of housing will be beyond the reach of many of the candidates and because the available housing is likely to be snapped up by the more affluent, thereby excluding from the housing market the local people whose interests they are trying to protect. We appreciate the feelings of those who see the character of their neighbourhoods changing and their communities being dominated by outsiders, be they commuters, second-home owners, retired people or people who have come from other countries. The answer cannot be to pull up the drawbridge; on that, the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West were important because he drew attention to the possibility of more housing land being brought forward on a voluntary basis by people being prepared effectively to give it as a gift for use by housing associations. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West referred to a potential fiscal problem in that connection, especially for capital gains tax. I shall draw his remarks to the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Government are well aware of the anomaly and are looking closely to see whether there are any practical means of distinguishing these cases in a way that would enable us to deal with that problem. Another initiative that we have taken in recent weeks has been to announce a new deal which will bring considerable comfort to those who live in rural areas, particularly in rural villages, and who resent the fact that their sons and daughters cannot afford accommodation in the place where they were brought up and wish to remain. We have said that exceptionally-and only exceptionally-local authorities may, where there is a demonstrable local need, grant planning permission, on sites where it would not normally be granted, specially for low-cost housing for local needs. They should also make arrangements to ensure that housing remains within the low-cost, local needs sector. It is crucial that these sites should be additional to, and not instead of, the provision for general market housing as set out in the development plan. The scheme should be used not as a means of keeping out outsiders but for bringing more land into the market place and making it available for local people. I hope that some of these initiatives will be welcome in west Dorset. I must emphasise that I am not advocating random development. Development must be properly planned, and it is important to remember, when considering household projections, that the need for development is absolute. So far as possible, we shall reduce existing under-used and derelict sites in the conurbations. We shall also maintain the green belt and other specially protected areas. But we shall still need fresh land for housing, and I look forward to the unanimous support of the House in willing not only the end but the means to ensure that enough houses can be built in the years ahead. I hope that hon. Members listened with interest and respect to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, who dealt with this issue with considerable knowledge. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) raised a number of points, but in the time available to me I shall deal only with his wrong assertion that the biggest cause of homelessness was mortgage repossessions. In the third quarter of 1988, a total of 7 per cent. of homelessness was attributable to mortgage repossessions. That was down from 10 per cent. in the previous year, so the trend is going in the opposite direction to that which the hon. Gentleman alleged. That demonstrates the scaremongering attitude that Opposition Members often adopt. They pay lip service to the idea of a property-owning democracy, but seem to seize any and every opportunity to try to frighten people away from home ownership. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heifer) did not miss that opportunity. He made assertions about the consequences for people who purchase houses in his area. An independent report found that, on average, right-to-buy purchasers were less heavily committed than other first-time buyers. The report stated: "" Most buyers have found the problem of purchase and the experience of home ownership to be entirely unproblematical."" Some people have taken on larger mortgages than perhaps they would have done had they known the extent to which interest rates would go up. I was disappointed that no Opposition Member pointed out that there is often scope for people in that situation to let one or more rooms in their homes, so helping to deal with the problem of homelessness. An initiative in that connection, on which the Opposition poured cold water, was brought in by the Housing Act 1988. It will make it easier for resident landlords to remove difficult tenants, an inhibition which has caused many people to be reluctant to let parts of their homes. The Opposition have been in one of their doom and gloom moods. They speak of a housing crisis which is really a crisis of their own. They lack a housing policy. Government successes have that effect on the Opposition. The more successful the Government are, the more gloomy the Opposition are. The more successful our housing initiatives are, the more gloomy the Opposition are. Socialists have good reason to be gloomy about housing. On national policies, they can hope that the public have short memories and have forgotten what Socialist policies were like in practice, but the Opposition are confronted daily by local examples of their policies in practice. We have seen already this year harrowing pictures of estates in Lambeth where tenants live like prisoners behind barricades. One would think that that might have shaken the Opposition from their complacency. The hon. Member for Hammersmith suggested that it was because of a lack of Government funding, but in the past year Lambeth has refused to collect from its tenants rents amounting to Â£5 million. Those rents could have been spent on improving property. Those estates represent Socialist housing policy in practice. The political views of a housing officer are more important than his management responsibilities. Rents may be low, but the standards of maintenance and repair are even lower--",1041,"['Adjournment (Easter)', 'Bill Presented']",Housing,2,120,housing,1735

Homelessness and unmet housing need may not directly affect as many as are affected by the problems of the national health service or the education service, but the scale of those problems means that homelessness and the housing problem must take their place among the major social issues which Britain faces. There are various ways of measuring the problem. The first is to look at the Government's homelessness statistics. Those figures, which were running at a high level last year, already show a dramatic increase for the first quarter of 1990. They show that for the year as a whole it is likely that no fewer than 150,000 households will be accepted officially as being homeless. On the usual extrapolation of those figures, that means that about 500,000 people are now regarded as homeless. Of those households, 33,000 are in some form of temporary accommodation and about 12,000 are in unsatisfactory bed and breakfast hotels. Those figures represent an increase of about 500 per cent. since 1982. In anybody's language, those figures are shocking, but they are only a fraction of the true measure of unmet housing need. Ministers will understand well that the figures do not measure those who applied to be treated as homeless but were not accepted, and that figure in turn is also at a shockingly high level-nearly 300,000 households at an annual rate this year. That figure does not include those who simply do not fall within the official definition of homeless. In other words, the young single homeless do not appear in the statutory figure and it does not include those who are now widely described as the hidden homeless. A recent survey in London estimated that figure at about 300,000. Those are the people familiar to many hon. Members on both sides of the House, those who present themselves at their surgeries-young couples, perhaps with a young baby, compelled to live apart, each with his and her respective parents and families who are compelled to move from one temporary address to another, begging the charity of friends and relatives. One of my constituents has no address; he simply lives in a car. He, too, does not appear in the homelessness statistics. The statistics do not tell the full story, but part of that story is told by the evidence of our own eyes. It is told through the evidence of the homelessness which we now see in the streets of our great cities. It is worth making the point in parenthesis that, although we tend to regard homelessness as an urban problem-indeed, as a London problem-the problem of homelessness among young people is rising faster in areas outside London than in the capital city. The sight of young people sleeping rough, alongside those who are mentally and emotionally incapable of looking after themselves and those who are the victims of changes in the income support rules or who are inadequately provided for in the wake of the care in the community provisions, is truly shocking. It is little wonder that the Government have reluctantly decided that that daily witness to the growing problem of homelessness-the sight of young people begging on our streets by day and sleeping on our streets by night-is too great a blot to be tolerated and that they have to do something about it. The Â£15 million measure announced by the Minister for Housing and Planning about 10 days ago at the Institute of Housing, while welcome, is no more than a street cleaning exercise. That is an inadequate response to a problem which demands much more than cosmetic treatment.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,2,housing,691

Perhaps the most compelling evidence for Members of Parliament is that presented to us through our postbags and at the surgeries which most hon. Members hold in their constituencies. I hold regular surgeries, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman does in his constituency. In recent years I have noticed a worrying and remorseless rise in the proportion of cases brought to me which involve housing needs. I estimate that perhaps 70 per cent.-sometimes more, but certainly 70 per cent.-of all my constituency cases involve some degree of unmet housing need. By the end of a long evening-perhaps three or four hours-considering such a range of problems, I feel profoundly depressed. That must be an experience common to hon. Members on both sides of the House, when we not only witness a parade of human misery, which is depressing in itself, but have to acknowledge that we cannot do anything, even in conjunction with a hard-working local authority, to alleviate the problems of most of those people. The all-too-predictable and depressing aspect of the housing crisis is that it hits those who are most vulnerable. A recent and good Department of the Environment survey showed that only 3 per cent. of the homeless had incomes at or above the national average. In London, a similar survey showed that fewer than 4 per cent. could afford to buy or rent homes in the private sector. We are dealing with people who are at the bottom of the income scale and, in many cases, are already vulnerable because of a physical or mental incapacity that makes it difficult for them to handle their affairs properly. We are often dealing with people who, by reason of membership of a minority, ethnic or otherwise, are likely to be discriminated against and to find themselves at the bottom of the pile. I fear that those groups are strongly represented in the numbers of those who are increasingly finding it difficult to be adequately housed. Britain is a rich country, still full of resources-at least according to some Conservative Members-and at the end of a decade of prosperity. It has certainly had an unprecedented bonus from North sea oil perhaps Â£120 billion to Â£130 billion of North sea wealth that was not previously available. How is it that a country that spends a great deal, perhaps notoriously, of its natural resources on housing and on subsidised housing can fail to provide adequate housing for a substantial minority of the least fortunate citizens in our midst? The facts that underline the problem can be simply stated. The problem arises, not surprisingly, because there is a shortage of housing at prices that people can afford. That shortage arises primarily because we have not built enough homes. Housing completions for 1989 made a total for that decade that was the lowest peacetime total of housing completions since the first world war. That failure occurred right across the board. If the trend established by the preceding Labour Government had been maintained this Government would have built an additional 600,000 houses. They would have reduced by 200,000 the number of houses that lack one basic amenity. There is a substantial shortfall because of the Government's failure to maintain the record established by the previous Labour Government.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,4,housing,559

There was an agreement between the Conservative and Labour parties in the city of Nottingham that, by the end of the 1970s, it would be out of the replacement era and would no longer be building 2,000 houses a year.

The whole point of the problem that I have described is that there is a growing homelessness problem, which cannot be denied. While that is the case, the pressure, the demand, and the need to build more houses remain and grow. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can explain the worst record of his Government in the way that he has attempted to do. The facts are clear. Under the six years of the preceding Labour Government, housing completions averaged 230,000 per year, but during the 10 years of this Government for which we have figures, the average annual total was 170,000.

The rate of household formation has risen for a variety of unfortunate reasons, such as marriage breakdown. There is now the relatively new or at least increased phenomenon of evictions and mortgage repossessions. All those factors have increased the need for additional housing, which is why the shortfall becomes so important. The failure to build houses over that period extends right across the board. The private sector did well for a short time, but, as everybody knows-and it hardly needs reinforcing-it has now fallen victim to the regime of high interest rates and its contribution to the housing scene has been much reduced since mid-1988. Housing associations, on which the Government pinned such great hopes as the main providers of social housing, have been hard hit-not only by high interest rates, but by the recently discovered problems of the Housing Corporation. No proper explanation has yet been offered about whether those problems are the result of mismanagement, bad luck, or simply having to grapple with the environment created by the Government. What is known is that even if the housing associations were freed from the problem of the difficulties of the Housing Corporation, they could not hope to meet more than a fraction of the shortfall, even at best. We also know that because of the Housing Corporation's difficulties, the Government's forecasts of completions by housing associations for the coming two years are now not worth the paper they are written on. I hope that when the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment replies to the debate he will inform the House, the housing associations, and all who depend on them for social housing of the new forecasts. I suspect that he will have a sorry story to tell-that is, if he is prepared to come clean.

The hon. Gentleman must accept that even if we were to squeeze that figure, and even if we could persuade his right hon. and hon. Friends to do something about the high rate of housing stock kept empty by Government Departments, we would still not have done enough to make good the failure to build the houses that we need. The picture is at its bleakest in local authorities. The private sector has fallen short, housing associations have been crippled even in respect of the relatively unambitious total set for them, but local authorities-despite all their efforts and against their will have been forced to cut housing provision dramatically. The figures are shocking. In 1976, local authorities in England completed 105,000 houses. Last year the figure was down to 16,000. It is scheduled-as Ministers will agree-to fall still further in the current year, and if the present Government remain in office much longer, no doubt it will be destined to disappear altogether.

The Government say that housing association provision can take the place of local authority dwellings to some extent. In 1978, under a Labour Government there were nearly 18,000 starts, but in 1989, before the Housing Corporation's present crisis, the figure was only 9,600.

1990-07-03,"Housing [Statutory Instruments, &C > Opposition Day > Environment]",361,Bryan Gould,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend is right, and I am grateful to him for that information. We have yet to hear the Minister's predictions for housing association completions over the next two years. It is a question not just of the shortfall of supply but of the affordability of housing. The impact of high mortgage interest rates on home owners is well known. I suspect that it is felt by a number of hon. Members, who will not need too much persuading of the severe repercussions of that development. Home ownership, so long held up as the great objective not only of Government policies but of all right-thinking people, has become an impossible dream for many-and an impossible nightmare for many more. I refer to the people who find it extremely difficult to maintain mortgage repayments. Many households and families whose budgets have been totally destroyed by the impact of high interest rates do not figure in any official statistics. At the fringe, there is the small but inexorably growing number of people who are substantially in arrears with their mortgage repayments. The number of those who have arrears of six months is growing all the time, as is the number of repossessions. It would be a mistake to imagine that the impact of high interest rates has been felt exclusively by owner-occupiers. Rents, too, have risen sharply, across the board. It is difficult to measure the rise in the private sector, but rents of housing associations-on which so many hopes were pinned have also sharply increased, by 24 per cent. Last year alone. That is because those associations are directed increasingly to raise capital on the open market, so they, too, pay high interest rates. In the public sector, as among the private rented sector, tenants have faced substantially increased rents. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) has done excellent work in detailing the impact on one local authority area after another. No doubt he will say more about that issue later. It is clear that many local authorities have found it extremely unpleasant to be forced to push up council rents against their own better judgment. It is worth recalling that the west Oxfordshire Tory councillors who resigned the Tory Whip did so not just because of the poll tax but because they resented and were unwilling to comply with the direction to force up council rents to market levels. They pointed to the impact of ring fencing on the housing revenue account, and of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 in directing local authorities to raise rents to market levels.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,12,housing,435

1990-07-03,"Housing [Statutory Instruments, &C > Opposition Day > Environment]",363,Bryan Gould,Lab,False,"If the hon. Gentleman will contain his impatience and allow me to proceed, I will rapidly reach the point that will satisfy his request. Inadequate supply and increasing housing costs go some way to explaining the crisis but not why it exists. No Opposition Member supposes that the Government deliberately created it. Rather, it is the consequence of a failure of analysis and the priority given to ideology. The Government have been misled by their own obsessions. As in other areas, it is not the Government but the most vulnerable who are paying the price for the Government's mistakes. I do not expect to carry Conservative Members with me when I make that assertion, but I hope that they will listen-particularly when I concede, as I have on other occasions, that we, too, have been guilty in the past of approaching housing from too ideological a viewpoint. We used to believe that only local authorities could provide social housing and that the intrinsic merits of public sector rented housing should override individual preferences. We recognised our mistakes, and I hope that the Government will do likewise. The Government's first mistake was a mirror image of our own. They held, for reasons of ideological obsession, that local authorities had no role to play in housing provision. That is why we saw a shocking decline in new house completions for which local authorities were responsible during the 1980s. That is why local authorities had their allocations cut and why their ability to borrow on the capital market was reduced. That is why they are subjected to the lunatic control that prevents them from spending their own capital receipts on housing provision. That shows how far the Government have been prepared to press their hostility towards local authorities, in an attempt to eliminate them from their essential role in meeting housing need. The Government's second mistake was excessive reliance on the private sector. No one disputes that it has a role to play, but, as is currently evident, the private sector is vulnerable to volatile market conditions, and is unable to sustain output when interest rates rise. The encouragement of house price inflation that was meant to sustain a boom has produced a bust instead. It was a mistake to assume that the private sector could carry the load by itself. The private sector itself acknowledges that truth. Unlike the Government, private companies in the construction industry admit that, while they can do a certain amount of work themselves, in many cases the price of success for them is co-operation and partnership with the public sector. They appreciate that, although they have capital and expertise to contribute, that is not enough by itself and that only local authorities in most cases have the land, land assembly powers, powers over planning, development, and most of all the democratic legitimacy-the accountability to their local communities-that allows them to provide and guarantee developments that are in the interests of those local communities. The Government's third mistake of an ideological nature was the belief that the market can always provide. Given the peculiar and convoluted structure of housing finance, and the structure of land prices and building costs, there is no way that the private market can meet the need for social housing. The Ministers must know that, because a study commissioned by their Department and carried out by Price Waterhouse last year demonstrated that a married man with two children on an income just above housing benefit level could afford a two-bedroomed house for his family and pay a private sector market rent for it in only two cities in Britain-Leicester and Newcastle. Elsewhere, the private sector simply does not provide housing to such a family at a price remotely in relation with its ability to pay. The Government's fourth mistake is obsession with tenure. They believe that changing tenure is somehow a solution to the problem of housing shortages. Whatever its merits or demerits, selling council houses does not add a single new unit to the housing stock. Indeed, it makes the management of existing stock in the public sector so much more difficult. Again, I suspect that many Conservative Members understand the experience that my local authority has. As family houses have been sold from the housing stock and the local authority has been prevented from replacing those houses, and making good that loss, it has become impossible to pursue the sensible management of the housing stock in the interests of the tenants. Previously, it was possible to put young, married, childless couples in high rise blocks. When the couple had children, they could be moved down to a flat or maisonette with a garden. As their children grew up the family could be put into a family house. When the children left home and the parents retired, the couple could be put back into a flat, as they wished. That was a sensible progress in the use of the housing stock, but it has ground to a halt because losses have been sustained to the housing stock but nothing has been done to replace the housing lost. The system now condemns young mothers with growing children to a permanent future in a flat at the top of a high rise tower block. I am aware that the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) can hardly contain his impatience, so I shall tell him what I believe is the way forward. It could be embraced by the Government as well as the Opposition. We must approach the provision of housing free from ideological preconceptions. We must use in as flexible and pragmatic a way possible all the instruments that lie to hand. That means that we shall encourage the private sector to make its contribution in what under a Labour Government would clearly be a more stable interest rate and investment climate. We would encourage the private sector to enter into partnership arrangements with local authorities and housing associations so that each could make their proper contribution to the joint enterprise and provide the houses that are needed. We should extend and encourage the role of housing associations. I hope that we shall be assured this evening that the problems of the Housing Corporation are of short duration and that the Government will come to the aid of their favourite instrument. We shall encourage local authorities to resume their essential role in meeting the need for social housing. We shall begin by progressively relaxing and removing the controls that prevent local authorities from spending their capital receipts. About 8.5 billion is held by local authorities. In many cases they would be willing, indeed keen, to spend a proportion of that money on the provision of housing and, in particular, on a programme to relieve the immediate problem of homelessness. We calculate that it would be possible to establish-indeed a Labour Government would immediately set in train-a scheme that would produce 50,000 houses at a cost of only a small proportion of the capital receipts held by local authorities. In case anyone asks what that figure is, I should mention that it is Â£1,850 million. That would be an immediate solution to the homelessness problem. We would then progressively further relax constraints so that local authorities could draw on the skills and resources required to enable them to make a proper contribution. We should not only approach the matter free from prejudice but encourage a level playing field in terms of subsidy so that people can really choose which type of tenure they prefer. Housing should be free from the imbalance that currently disfigures our housing finance. A huge and growing subsidy is provided to owner-occupiers. Admittedly that is a reflection of high interest rates. That provided a substantial financial incentive until recently to those who were tempted to buy their own homes.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,14,housing,1309

We should make that choice as easy and real as possible. We should recognise that the housing problem affects not only the homeless and those in inadequate housing, but the operation of our economy. In many parts of the economy inadequate housing affects labour mobility and makes it more difficult to attract essential public sector workers such as teachers, nurses, bus drivers, train drivers and so on. Unless we get to grips with the problem we shall be doing a disservice to the homeless and fatally handicapping our economy and our society. No Government can claim to have served the country well if a minority of its most vulnerable citizens cannot find decent housing. No Government can claim success if the number of homeless continues to grow, as it does. Therefore, I hope that the Minister for Housing and Planning will not claim success on behalf of the Government but will seriously address an issue of great importance and pressing urgency which is a growing blot on the Government's 11-year record.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,24,housing,293

I want, therefore, to announce a six-point plan for reinstating the private rented sector and for giving self-confidence back to the private landlord. First, we shall give the widest possible publicity to the provisions of the Housing Act 1988.

That is especially sad as this is the first housing debate that I have attended since he has been in post. There were several crucial issues regarding the housing crisis on which he did not see fit to touch. I shall come to some of them in a moment. I do not want to speak for too long as this is a short debate, but I want to make a couple of constituency points and a couple of policy points. The housing crisis is not evenly spread throughout the country. Everyone realises that. In the north, the condition of the stock is the overwhelming contributor to the crisis, whereas in the south it is the sheer shortage of stock. In the midlands, we are piggy in the middle. We suffer from poor quality housing and a shortage of stock, but not to the extremes that are experienced in the north and south. That means that we are left out; we do not make the headlines. Nevertheless, the extent and nature of the housing crisis in the midlands is such that, were we talking about London, it would merit headline space. That point is not made clear in our general housing policy. It is not made clear in the media and it is ignored by those with London-centred attitudes. I shall refer in a moment to the Housing Corporation, but I want first to refer to Birmingham, part of which I represent. In recent years, we have lost out badly in the housing allocation. We have a massive amount of system-built housing to replace. That housing needs to be cleared; it cannot be renovated. The Boswell houses and the 900 Boot houses in my constituency cannot be salvaged. They will have to be replaced with a variety of mixed tenure housing of varying density and with different financial arrangements. That was par for the course to the Labour party when I was on the Front Bench, and it remains par for the course now. We do not have the financial wherewithal to provide the public money to pull in the private capital that we need to make those changes. That is why I think that the Government have gone too far. Let me give an example. In the housing needs index and stress area review undertaken by the Housing Corporation, Birmingham lost out more than any other city or district in England. By 1992-93, the Housing Corporation's programme will be worth Â£1.7 billion-double what it was two or three years ago. By then, Birmingham will be losing out to the tune of Â£20 million a year because of the changes in the housing needs index and the stress area factors: the city will have lost 1.3 percentage points in that index. The Minister frowns, but he can check those figures and he will find that they are accurate. We shall lose Â£20 million a year after taking the stress area factors into account. We must bear in mind the fact that that loss is on top of Birmingham's ever-declining housing investment programme allocation. The Minister talks for all the world as though the housing investment allocations and the housing investment programme are public subsidy. They are not. They merely give the city permission to borrow money, on which the council will have to pay market interest rates.

He spoke of the capital allocation, not the interest subsidy, and one must consider the two things separately. The HIP allocation for Birmingham is not money given to Birmingham by the Government. The Government are merely giving Birmingham permission to borrow. As I said, that makes matters even worse because, over the years, our allocation has been cut and it is planned to cut it even further. We are supposed to be the country's second city, yet on the Z scores of the census index we have the largest single concentrated area of deprivation in the country. I am not talking down my city-we have to make a realistic case for the bids-but if similar circumstances applied in London, they would be headline news. We do not have a cardboard city in Birmingham yet, but it is around the corner. Virtually every hostel in the city is almost full every night. It would take only a slight change now and we would have a cardboard city. A slight shift would also mean families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. To its credit, Birmingham city council has never yet placed a family in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. It ill behoves the Minister to castigate the council on the number of empty dwellings, which is less than the national average-less than 2 per cent. There will always be empty properties. Heaven knows, I have criticised Labour and Tory-controlled councils alike for having an excessive number of empty properties which could be available for letting. But in a country with about 20 million dwellings and with millions of people moving around, we shall always have empty dwellings. It stands to reason. Every dwelling cannot be full every night. I understand that, according to the professionals, we need about 4 per cent., and, by and large, that is the private sector figure. The local authority average is only 2.3 per cent. We need 4 per cent. to keep the system going so that people have the chance to move. As I said, Birmingham city council has never yet put a family in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, but we are close to it and to cardboard city. Boosting the private landlord, as the Minister did in his speech, is not the answer. Being someone else's landlord is not an acceptable way to earn a living. That is a bald, stark statement, but it is not an attack on decent, caring private landlords. I probably should have said "" being someone's exploitative landlord"". That is the difference between the Opposition and the Tories. We genuinely want a partnership with the private sector-in tenure and money-but not an exploitative private sector. We genuinely want variety and change in finance and tenure, but we will not set up one section of society financially to exploit another. The Minister talked about opening rooms above shops. The Tories have been talking about that for the past 11 years, but they have done nothing about it, save in one or two areas in which there was some heritage or historical aspect or some extra funny-money funding that they could find to assist. They have not seriously tackled the problem in 11 years. It is no good trotting out that policy now in the twilight of the Government, because it will not wash.

Members for some months been on the receiving end of the most desperate pleas from housing associations that did everything that they were asked to do to get ready for the new system? They would have been the first to be on the receiving end of complaints from Ministers if they had not been ready for the new regime, but they were ready. They told the Housing Corporation that they were ready. One assumes that the Housing Corporation told the Government that they were ready. The Public Accounts Committee has not yet reported on that matter. I must assume that the assurances that were given to the Public Accounts Committee last November about the strength and sophistication of financial forecasting have been totally shot to pieces and exposed as false in the past few months. The Housing Corporation-perhaps with the Government's hand on it-has failed to meet its duties and responsibilities of financial management and control. The end result is that building firms will shed labour and homeless people will not get homes. I give one example, and I make no apology for choosing it, from the city of Birmingham. Birmingham Friendship housing association wants to build four five-person houses on a site in Sparkbrook. It has forged a package deal with a local builder who owns the site. The scheme, just under Â£300,000, is in the draft Housing Corporation 1990-91 programme, but, like many other housing associations, Birmingham Friendship does not know whether it will get an allocation for work this year. Meanwhile, the builder, who has held his price for the scheme since last year, is anxious to get on with the work. A small scheme, nevertheless, sums up the hardships and disappointments suffered on the ground because of the cash crisis. Homes for local Asian families will be lost. Work in an area of high unemployment will be lost to a firm of multi-ethnic builders which has held its costs for a year, waiting on the promise that it was in the draft Housing Corporation programme. That is just one example-four houses for five families-and it can be repeated in virtually every urban area in the country. It is all because of financial mismanagement on the part of the Housing Corporation because the Government either did not listen or took no account of the information that they received. I emphasise that that is happening in every urban area in the country. One word that I did not hear fall from the Minister's lips was "" rural"". Not once did he refer to the problems of rural dwellers and the housing crisis. It is no good his pointing to the Secretary of State for the Environment, who must be one of the most disappointed Secretaries of State ever to see successive Ministers of State come and go in his own Department. If he is to refer to rural areas, that is fine. My remark was not meant personally. I have great respect for the Under-Secretary of State. He has been badly treated by the Prime Minister. I now raise a couple of issues about rural problems. I make no apology for that. I am an urban dweller and an urban representative, but someone must make the case for rural dwellers Tory-Members do not do it. The problem is constantly left to Opposition Members. My record is quite good. I had an Adjournment debate on the problems of rural communities. If the Minister's minders want to look it up, it was on 5 April of this year and is reported at column 1394 of Hansard. I raised the whole gamut of the problems of rural dwellers. I referred to the difficulties of housing and gave some examples, but at column 1399 the Minister talked about increasing investment in rural areas through housing associations and referred to the programme, which had been announced, of schemes for communities with fewer than 1,000 people. He referred also to providing low-cost homes. He said that, when the scheme was in place, it would provide 1,500 homes for rent in small villages and 350 homes a year for local sales. He talked about a scheme of repurchasing former shared-ownership dwellings when the occupiers move on. What has happened to that scheme? I understand that it has not been possible to put the scheme together in a way in which, according to lawyers, it will work. I should like an update on what has happened to the scheme to provide more low-cost, low-rent and affordable homes in rural areas. The Government made great play of the scheme when it was announced. When will bricks be placed on the mortar and when will the houses come into being? I referred also to the remarks of the chairman of the Rural Development Commission, Lord Vinson, who is certainly not a supporter of our party-he is not a member of it. He said, and I agreed, that, on average, we need only a handful of homes in every sizeable village, but they must be affordable homes. When I was the Opposition spokesman on housing, I suggested geographically rounding off communities. Like most other people, I do not want urban sprawl, and I do not want to destroy the countryside. I do not regard the countryside as a jigsaw puzzle or the lid on a chocolate box, which classy marketeers tell us it is all about. That is not the reality of life in rural areas when youngsters are forced to move away from villages and small towns and away from their families and jobs because they cannot possibly afford the massive prices for very small dwellings because of the dislocation of prices in rural areas. That problem must be met. I do not see action on the ground. On 5 April, the Minister made it clear to me that work was in hand. I still do not see the difficulty, and if the Minister introduces a planning Bill he will get my support. Smaller developments in smaller villages and towns can be achieved-there is much academic work to prove that. One would not face the problem of Foxley Wood and the like, although there may be occasions when new small towns should be developed. I believe that the concept that I have outlined is sustainable politically and financially. Unless something like that is developed, the problems of rural dwellers will get even worse. Ministers must come to terms with that because they have ignored the problem of rural dwellers for too long.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,64,housing,1097

My comment does not, however, reflect on the content of those speeches. Accordingly, I shall try to set an example by being brief. I declare at the outset that, as all the House knows, I have been a board member of Shelter since 1983. That fact is occasionally used by each side of the House in support of their argument and I assume on that basis that they are fairly balanced. I should also declare, as recorded in the Register of Members' Interests, that I am director of a group of companies that rent out properties. There is a seductive glamour about the use of capital receipts and it was especially prevalent when I was wearing my local government hat. The Government's stance has been attacked, but, in truth, the issue is simple. If one believes that housing needs broadly approximate to the arising of capital housing receipts, one has an argument. I believe that there is virtually no connection between housing needs and the arising of receipts. Therefore, some system akin to that used now by the Government for allocating permission to borrow to local authorities with lower receipts is essential. That practice would be followed by any Government-no post-war Government have introduced controls on capital borrowing. There is understandable dismay on both sides of the Chamber at the sight of people living rough in our major cities. The Daily Telegraph was right when it said in June: "" In a civilised society it is unacceptable to have people sleeping on the streets because they have nowhere to go."" Similar scenes are repeated in other western countries, but that does not reduce our concern, although it may temper the more extreme political comments made. The Minister and the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) set out some of the circumstances and social background to the problem. I judge that it is the responsibility of Government, local authorities and the various agencies connected with them to deal with this problem. Other than personal choice, there should be no reason for people to live rough in the streets or under cardboard. The Government have launched a sustained and welcome series of initiatives. Tonight my hon. Friend outlined another six, but time does not allow me to comment on them in detail. One initiative relates to people with surplus property or rooms who do not want to be involved in what they see as the palaver of renting and engaging tenants. The initiative will enable those people to engage housing associations to do it for them. Those associations will guarantee them a rate of return. Anything that encourages such people is welcome. All the initiatives are welcome, though overdue, and form part of the solution for which we seek. I also welcome-I would, wouldn't I?-the Â£2 million initiative announced a few months ago by my hon. Friend the Minister. That initiative will enable the development of a nationwide framework of advice centres, essentially run by Shelter and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux-NACAB. That initiative wisely draws on Shelter's knowledge and expertise and it is designed to encourage young people, where possible, to remain in their local area rather than to drift into the big cities, with all the attendant difficulties that that causes. Tonight little mention has been made of the problem of the mentally handicapped. Many have now been released into the community, but in some instances they are inadequate, unable to house themselves and perhaps institutionalised. I am aware that the Department of Health will launch an initiative on that in the near future. However, the problems of the mentally ill are extremely pressing as they form a significant part of those who are currently homeless. We owe it to them to announce that initiative as soon as possible. The hon. Member for Dagenham is one of the acceptable faces of the Labour party. His acceptance of guilt and past ideological sins was touching, but had he studied the faces behind him, let alone left the Chamber and spoken to many Labour party councillors, he would have discovered a less than equivalent atonement. The Labour party and those who run the large council housing empires have welcomed the advent of housing associations in their much enhanced role with all the enthusiasm of people eating sheep's eyes for the first time. When the Labour party considers the rest of the private-rented sector, it does not like or understand it. The Labour party has forgotten that every extra right for a tenant is an extra responsibility or loss to a putative landlord. I agree with the Minister that the Labour party wants to turn the clock back because it is wedded to the public sector and the belief that it knows better. I do not know why, as the housing record of far too many Labour authorities is too depressing whether judged on the number of properties empty, the size of rent arrears or their practice of opposing by every reasonable legal way people wanting to exercise their right to buy. I cannot believe that that record can act as an example to the Labour party as, whichever way one looks at it, the picture is grim. Last week there was a fascinating editorial in The Sunday Times on a wide range of issues of which housing was but a part. That editorial was not uncritical of the Government and the gist of it was that more public spending was not the solution to most of our problems. It noted:"" Overall spending on public services was 15 per cent. higher in 1989-90 than it was during the last year of the last Labour government. So much for the 'vicious cuts of the brutal Thatcher regime' ... The idea that Britain can be cleansed of public squalor by spending more money on public services is a widely believed nonsense. What nearly every public service needs is not more money, but more competition."" Nothing would increase the standard of rented property more than to have several would-be landlords clamouring for one tenant-that has been demonstrated in other areas of necessity such as food and clothing. Instead the landlord has been frightened away by the fear of a possible future Labour Government-not lessened by tonight's contributions. All housing reforms should be judged on the acid test: will they increase the supply of rented property efficiently? The article concluded: "" At least the government realises what needs to be done. Labour prefers the soft option of simply promising to spend much more on monopoly public services, which on present evidence most often makes them worse."" For those and other reasons, I oppose the Labour motion.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,66,housing,1141
1990-07-03,"Housing [Statutory Instruments, &C > Opposition Day > Environment]",416,Ronnie Fearn,LibDem,False,"The Government may well claim that never have so many people owned their own houses, and that that is, of course, because of Government policies. But they must also claim that never have so many people been homeless, sleeping rough on the streets, in derelict buildings, in substandard lodgings, hostels or bed-and-breakfast accommodation. That is also a direct result of Government policy. There is no doubt that in the past 10 years there has been a sharp increase in the number of homeless, well above any expected trend. A report commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree memorial trust, "" Homeless in Britain"", shows that every day an average 1,000 households apply to local councils for help and that during the past 10 years, more than 1 million households have been registered as homeless by local authorities. The problem is no longer a phenomenon of our largest cities. People are sleeping on our streets, in unused buildings, temporary accommodation and other unsuitable places right across this land of ours. My own area of Southport, in Sefton, north-west England, has a homeless problem, which has been growing for the past few years as the local authority finds its hands tied with restrictions on housing finance, and social services departments find it increasingly difficult, because of their restricted resources, to assist people who are homeless through no fault of their own. Such people have been turned out of hospitals and other institutions as a result of the Government's policy of closing down such homes without providing an alternative means of care or an alternative place to live. Such short-term measures as that announced by the Minister for Housing and Planning on 22 June to provide Â£15 million for additional subsidies and subsidised accommodation for the single homeless, may give some small relief. However, I fear that it may create more problems than it will solve. Until we recognise the underlying causes of homelessness and instigate a programme to combat them, the long-term prospects for Britain's homeless are bleak. Another problem that I fear such short-term measures may create is to put pressure on the police force to use the Vagrancy Act 1824 and other laws to move people off the streets. To give people who are already down and out a criminal record as well will do little to enhance their prospects of finding permanent housing. If there is any form of compulsion attached to the programme, it is likely to be defeated before it gets off the ground. Young people may rebel against it, particularly if they can be compelled to enter an institutionalised system, of which many of them have had experience and are trying to avoid. There will also be a problem finding buildings with long-term leases at a reasonable cost. That will not be an easy task in the south-east. There will be problems in finding the staff and volunteers to run such centres. Many of the young people on our streets are vulnerable. What safeguards will there be to ensure that someone placed in a position of trust can be trusted? I fear that short-term measures will serve only to paper over the cracks in time for the general election. Once the young people who sleep on our streets are safely hidden in hostels and dormatories, the issue of Britain's homeless will be put on the back burner. Those are the problems that arise from short-term measures, but I must not spend any more time on that subject because it will deter from the main argument, which is to identify solutions for the causes of homelessness. There is no dispute-or should not be-that the single, most important cause of homelessness is the lack of affordable housing units. The blame for that can be laid directly at the feet of the Government. Due to the Government's policy to reduce public spending, their dislike of local government and their utter contempt for anything that might be seen as public service, the provision of social services and social housing by local government has been virtually destroyed. The right-to-buy policy is not, in itself, a mistake, and the principle behind it is to be welcomed. Encouragement should be given to the voluntary and, in some cases, private sector to increase their contribution to the provision of housing, particularly affordable housing units. What is wrong is the way in which the Government have approached and administered that policy. The Government have failed to recognise-or perhaps chosen to ignore-the fact that in any society there will always be a need for social housing and housing at affordable rents and prices. The right-to-buy programme, when coupled with restrictions on the use of capital receipts, has resulted in a critical shortage of such housing. In 1979, the number of new council houses built was 79,009. In 1989, that figure dropped to a mere 14,925. At the same time, the numbers on waiting lists requiring accommodation had increased from 741,000 in 1983 to 1,268,000 in 1988. That is the scale of the problem. The Government's attempts to move the emphasis of the provision of social housing to the voluntary and private sectors have failed, because they do not understand the nature of the matter with which they are dealing, and because they have not enabled the individual to acquire the means to obtain access to affordable housing. The pressure on housing associations to take up the slack, accompanied by a reduction in central Government funds, has meant that they have had to bridge the gap between public and private sector funding through the raising of rents. In effect, they have had to move up market. The purpose of housing associations was originally to provide for the more vulnerable groups-those on low incomes, and the elderly. However, Government pressure has forced them into the business of catering for the conventional household and those more able to pay, rather than those in need. Consequently, access to permanent affordable housing for the traditional clients of housing associations has been further reduced. The sorry saga surrounding the administration and funding of the Housing Corporation is now undermining confidence in housing associations in general, and provision of all types of homes by that process is consequently under threat. Women have possibly been the hardest hit by current housing policy. I recommend to the Government-and to all parties-the excellent Shelter publication, "" Women Losing Out"", which points out that housing policies are based on assumptions about the family, and about women's role within families. The policy is designed on the assumption that the nuclear family is the norm, whereas it accounts for only 28 per cent. of households. One-parent families with one young child represent 40 per cent. of the homeless. More than 50,000 one-parent households in Britain become homeless in a year, according to the Joseph Rowntree report. In an era that promotes home ownership at the expense of public housing, women's housing options have been drastically reduced. Their traditionally low incomes and employment prospects create vast inequalities in access to housing between men and women. The Government's housing policy is now based on the ability to pay rather than on need. The housing Acts of 1988 and 1989 have increased the difficulties of those who are unable to buy. They have reduced security of tenure, introduced higher rents and reduced benefits, owing to the system of assessment of what it is reasonable to pay rather than what the tenant is paying for. Despite all their efforts, the Government have failed to attract the private sector back to rented accommodation. The measures about which we have heard tonight will not affect that either. The private sector still accounts for only 10 per cent. of rented provision, and much of that is to students and single professionals rather than to families. I was interested to read in the Observer last Sunday that, owing to the high cost of living in the south and south-east, northern universities are expecting 50,000 extra students in September and landlords are already preparing their welcome with plans to increase rents by 15 to 20 per cent. and an insistence on 12-month contracts, although the academic year is only 32 weeks long. Students and some other young people increasingly find that they are in a no-win situation, with rents payable in advance. For students whose grants are payable term by term and for young people on social security which is paid in arrears, the chance of finding a permanent roof over their head is slim. The housing crisis in Britain will get worse as high mortgage rates and ever-increasing rents push people into arrears. In 1979 there were 2,530 repossessions; in 1989, there were 13,780. That figure is bound to climb, as will the number of evictions from rented property. I am intrigued to know how the Government intend to square the conflict in their advice. Perhaps the Minister will answer that question. As inflation bites and unemployment rises, their philosophy demands that they encourage young and old alike to get on their bike and look for a job. As the housing crisis deepens and homelessness is rampant, the Government's advice appears to be to stay put, as the pavements of London and other large cities are not paved with gold. Indeed, they are more likely to be paved with Britain's homeless. Because of the housing crisis in rural and urban areas alike, such advice is useless. What can we do about the problem? We must start from the premise that the country believes that the Government have a duty to ensure that everyone has access to affordable housing. I urge the Government to start towards achieving that aim by removing many of the restrictions that they have placed on local authorities. The top priority must be the release of capital receipts to enable local authorities to replenish stock, by providing houses themselves, by allowing housing associations to cater for the more traditional client, or through partnership with the private sector. Another priority is to bring existing stock up to standard. Where necessary, there should be powers to purchase homes or to carry out repairs to empty private sector homes whose owners have refused to bring them up to a habitable standard. It is a tragedy and a sin that so many properties are empty. In May 1988 there were 23,000 such homes in the public sector, of which only 4,100 were available for rent. According to the Minister for Housing and Planning in an article in the Municipal Journal on 15 June, there were 600,000 vacant properties in the private sector. I should like to see the Housing Corporation retained, at least in principle, and it should be given more funds. I should welcome changes to the way in which we define "" homeless"" and changes to the social security system to prevent the policy working against the young and the single homeless and especially against women who, because of our present system, remain trapped in unbearable situations that are often dangerous. We need to change the housing benefit system so that it reflects the true cost of rents. That could be combined with the introduction of housing cost relief, a policy advocated by my party in our policy document "" Housing, a time for Action"", and it would apply to home buyers and people who rent. Affordable housing for all is more than the provision of bricks and mortar. Among other things, it is about the economy, our tax system, our communities, planning and the environment. Our policy document contains innovative ideas for the provision of decent housing. I commend it to the Minister and to Conservative Members.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,67,housing,1940

Members have spoken about the release of capital receipts, and I think that the Minister also mentioned it. I hope that he will be able to assure us that that matter has a high priority. At a time when the nation has a housing crisis it is utterly ridiculous to sit on millions of pounds that could be put to good use. The money was raised by local authorities on the understanding that they would be able to reinvest it. That has not happened and the freezing of the funds is causing considerable distress. The money is there for a purpose for which it is not being used. I wish to speak about the people who are at the bottom of the pile. I have the pleasure of being chairman of Stonham housing association. Most hon. Members attend their surgeries on Saturday mornings. At one time that was a fairly relaxed affair. However, every surgery that I attend becomes harder and more distressing. People come to me with the seemingly insoluble problem of having nowhere to go. I am sure that all hon. Members have met such people in their surgeries. Women about to go into hospital to have a baby do not have the slightest idea where they will go when they come out. What greater stress could one impose upon a person? In general, the Stonham housing association picks up the debris of the nation, those who are at the bottom of the pile. We provide accommodation for about 10,500 people a day and we provide for all those whom Christians in every street sympathise about but do not want to do anything to help. I have been in the House for some years, and in housing debate after housing debate I have heard Ministers from both parties say we should be doing various things. For example, they have said that they will ensure that houses belonging to the services-the armed forces and the police-are brought into occupation, as we do not need so many empty houses. I am sorry to say that nothing much has happened. I hope that the thoughts that the Minister shared with us tonight will bring about some fundamental changes. Unless they do, organisations such as Stonham, the Salvation Army and many others that take care of the sad people in the community will close. My organisation is satisfied that our finances will just about get us through another year. But unless there is some improvement in the complicated and nonsensical bureaucracy that has crept into the housing system, we expect that many organisations will have to close because there will be no money. In London there are 75,000 single homeless people, and there is cardboard city. One does not have to go far from here to see the homeless. When I am on my way home I find old ladies sleeping in the bushes just down the road. It is sickening, and no hon. Member could find any funny feature in it, as it is horrifying. The problem is not entirely caused by lack of money; we have to care about what happens to these people. If the various types of empty accommodation that hon. Members from both sides of the House have mentioned were used, we would not have a housing list, We would not have the misery that exists at present. We would not have people shuddering because a hostel might be put next door to them, and they are worried that it would not be attractive for their street, or that it might affect the value of their property. Even in my constituency, in Cheltenham, there are many empty properties. I am not making a political point, but the town is under the control of the Liberals. People come to my advice bureau and tell me that they walk round the town and see empty houses and flats owned by the local authority. Local authorities have much to answer for. They are so dilatory about carrying out the repairs and maintenance which would enable properties to be occupied that absurd situations arise. Young people with three children are put on the top floor of a 10-storey block. The mix of people in such blocks of flats sometimes causes indescribable trouble. Anti-social behaviour between neighbours increases week by week and sadly it often ends up with someone going to prison. A lot can be done without the investment of vast sums of money, because we have already allocated millions of pounds for housing which could be better invested than it has been in the past.

1990-07-03,"Housing [Statutory Instruments, &C > Opposition Day > Environment]",418,Dennis Turner,Lab,False,"When the history of the 1980s comes to be written, one of the Government's real and unforgivable failures will be their lack of a comprehensive and cohesive housing policy. That failure has condemned millions or our citizens to live in inadequate homes and thousands to be without accommodation altogether. Almost immediately upon taking office, the Government began to cut the housing improvement programme which the Labour Government had developed extensively in the 1970s and which raised to modern standards the amenities of many hundreds of inter-war council houses. Pre-1919 terraced housing, with outside toilets and sub-standard kitchens and bathrooms, cried out for improvement and major internal and external repairs were needed to prevent them from falling down. The Government's response has been to drip feed that sector with small and completely unrealistic funds, leading to the outrageous situation in the 1990s of much decrepit and unhygienic housing in all our major towns and cities. Had the level of funding in real terms under the previous Labour Government been continued, many of those houses would now have been improved and many thousands of families would be living in more pleasant and environmentally acceptable conditions. Equally worrying is the way in which the Government have, at every opportunity, sought to weaken and frustrate the role of public housing authorities in planning and servicing local housing provision within their communities. All manner of devices have been invented in order to remove local government from that important social policy area of human need. Legislation has directed powers and finance to housing associations through the Housing Corporation with all the attendant difficulties and demarcation problems. There is great pressure on some housing associations to take on more responsibility in housing than they are capable of dealing with. The Labour party recognises that housing associations have a positive role to play, but they should work in partnership with local government, the special needs housing sector and the important and emerging co-operative housing sector. Much more devious has been the Government's promotion of the private sector. Insurance and property development companies have been encouraged to move into the private housing sector and to buy up housing estates and parcels of council houses, all complete with sitting tenants, in order to deprive local authorities of their historic and accepted housing role. The Government have been unable to resist the attractive prospect of giving their friends in the City major capital gains through long-term property values and the ability to make huge financial gains by imposing massive rent increases on the poor tenants involved. High powered propaganda accompanied the Government's ideological separation from fairness and common sense. Thank goodness council tenants in Britain have dispatched that crazy notion to the dustbin of history by voting overwhelmingly against housing action trusts for their estates. Once again, there is an absence of compassion in the Government's treatment of the thousands of elderly and handicapped citizens who are condemned to live their lives in accommodation wholly unsuited to their special needs. Bungalows and specially adapted accommodation for the elderly and the handicapped are at a premium in almost all areas. In my locality, it was recorded recently that about 2,500 elderly and disabled people were competing for the 50 bungalows available for letting. On that basis, many will die without having benefited from the well-being that such accommodation can bestow. In addition, there is the misery and degradation of homelessness for many thousands of people in the Prime Minister's caring society; the uphill struggle for millions of people trying to meet record mortgage and rent payments; and, as we are now witnessing, the collapse of the private housing sector. In this debate, we are again presented with a classic picture of Tory indifference in the midst of irrefutable evidence of a major social need in housing which continues to go unmet.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,69,housing,639
1990-07-03,"Housing [Statutory Instruments, &C > Opposition Day > Environment]",419,Timothy Raison,Con,False,"Unlike the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Turner), I believe that the Government have had considerable housing achievements to their credit during the past decade. The outstanding achievement has been the enormous stimulus to owner-occupation through the introduction of the right to buy, but in other respects also our housing stock is clearly better. It is interesting to note that, even during the past few years, there has been a marked improvement in the quality of local authority housing, certainly in my constituency. That is largely a product of the fact that capital receipts could not be spent on new building-or only a limited amount-and as a result a great deal of money has been available for improving council stock, and there have been substantial improvements. The focus of the debate is, rightly, not on owner-occupation, but on the problems for those who cannot afford to buy houses and therefore have to look for low-cost rented housing. That is now the real priority in housing policy, and I hope that my right hon. Friend and his colleagues will accept that. As we have heard from a number of hon. Members, the problem has been made worse by the increase in family breakdowns and the increased number of one-parent families. I do not share the view that that is a trend about which nothing can be done. However, I recognise that it is putting pressure on local authority and low-cost housing. Aylesbury Vale, in my constituency-and I am happy to talk about this after what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) said-spans both rural and urban housing. There has been a steady rate of council building until recently, and currently there is a genuine waiting list that can be measured in hundreds, certainly not in thousands. I am concerned that there may be real trouble ahead. I listened to what my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Sir C. Irving) said about what was happening in his advice bureau. I would not phrase it as dramatically as he did, but I am aware of an increasing pressure from less-well-off people who are trying to find somewhere to live. Constituencies such as mine will be in significant trouble during the next decade or two unless further action is taken because council building will virtually come to an end. It has almost no housing investment programme allocation in the current year, although it had and still has a fairly steady rate of building. It appears that, by next year, only about 16 buildings will be erected by the council within the Aylesbury Vale area. We are disappointed that we have no allocation for the kind of equity sharing programmes that, in principle, have much to commend them. The sharp drop in council building would be fine if we could be confident that the increased demand would be taken up by housing association construction. Local authorities in my constituency have been active in pursuing that option, and Chiltern local authority has successfully converted the whole of its housing stock to a housing association. In Aylesbury, where the pressure is greater, we have encouraged housing associations, and they have shown interest-recognising that even fairly affluent places such as Buckinghamshire have housing needs. However, when it comes to the crunch, associations find it difficult to build the houses that local authorities cannot provide. That partly has to do with the drying up of Housing Corporation funding. No doubt that is a problem brought about by its success-and I accept the remarks of my hon. Friend the Minister in that respect-but the difficulty remains that it takes time for housing associations that move into an area where there has been very little general purpose association activity to get off the mark. If the Government are to rely on the Housing Corporation as the main instrument of providing low-cost housing, it is important to my constituency and others that resources are made available to the Housing Corporation for it to do its job. I hope that when my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary winds up he will say more about that aspect than did my hon. Friend the Minister. The private rented sector has also featured in this debate. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I welcome the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister about new means of encouraging the private rented sector. It is difficult in areas like mine to do a great deal very rapidly because they do not have large numbers of Victorian houses available for conversion into private rented housing. That is not the nature of property in my constituency, and it is a problem elsewhere also. Can new construction for private renting be encouraged? I do not share the horror of some Opposition Members of private money being invested in housing and making a profit. That is a perfectly desirable activity, and I am all for encouraging it. There was certainly some evidence of ambivalence among Opposition Members on that issue. The real problem is providing an adequate economic return on the investment necessary to develop low-cost private rented housing. We need social housing and to give backing to the Housing Corporation, but I still believe that there is scope for new council housing. One of its merits is that it provides an avenue into owner-occupation in a way that housing association property does not. Many people in my constituency have moved on from renting new local authority housing to buying those properties, and have turned them into good owner-occupied houses. It would be a pity if that process were to end. The question of council rents has not featured greatly in today's debate. Clearly they should be reasonable. It is true that they are backed, by and large, by a fairly generous housing benefit system, but it was a mistake to press for a Â£4.50 rent increase in areas such as mine in April. That was not really necessary, and it is particularly unfortunate that it coincided with the introduction of the community charge and higher water charges. I hope that when next year the question of the assumed rent increases expected by the Department of the Environment arises, my hon. Friend the Minister will do all that he can to contain them within very reasonable limits. Although there is an underlying assumption that rents in the council sector should move more towards market levels, which has an element of wisdom, many people in constituencies such as mine, which are fairly prosperous, nevertheless do not have higher incomes than their counterparts in the north of England or other areas, where the cost of housing is deemed to be lower. If someone happens to work in the health service or in local government on relatively low pay, the pay is exactly the same as it is for someone who works in Lancashire, Northumberland or elsewhere. It is not reasonable to expect people on the same level of pay in other parts of the country to pay higher local authority council rents. Housing for the less-well-off is of considerable importance. It is important politically. I am sure that my hon. Friends are aware of that. It is also important for the well-being of our people. I hope that we can bring to its conclusion the drive, energy and success that we have shown in tackling the question of owner-occupation.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,70,housing,1230
1990-07-03,"Housing [Statutory Instruments, &C > Opposition Day > Environment]",420,David Trimble,UUP,False,"Initially I was reluctant to speak in this debate because the motion, with its references to the Housing Act 1988 and to urban and rural areas in Britain, seemed more a Great Britain than a United Kingdom motion. After I made my maiden speech, one Conservative Member said to me that he hoped that I would speak in United Kingdom debates and not limit myself to Northern Ireland matters. However, if I am to contribute to United Kingdom debates, United Kingdom debates must be held. The motion refers mainly to the Housing Act 1988. I have heard rumours that that Act may be extended shortly to Northern Ireland. That would be worth examining. I welcome the extension of home ownership, which has been one of the chief achievements of the Government. I am also glad that they realise that the extension of home ownership will go only so far and that it is also necessary to maintain the rented sector, both public and private. The public sector should not be limited. We need to expand and help the private rented sector. The chief measure in the 1988 Act was to bring rents up to market levels in the hope that such rents would increase supply. As I said to the Minister the other week, the experience at home is quite the opposite. We have had no rent control on new-build properties for 30 years but there has not been a significant increase in the supply. It could be argued that market rents should be introduced independently because it is slightly unfair to expect the private landlord to subsidise people and we should not deprive them of the income that their property would otherwise command. However, moving to market rents is not enough to solve the problem. We must consider other matters. Obviously, an increase in supply is desirable. I was glad to hear that changes will be made on the planning side and that planning controls will be relaxed. That should not be a matter of rushing off into green field sites to build. One should look to urban areas where much land could be made available. Moreover, planning difficulties are not always the fault of public corporations and local authorities. It is often the fault of the planning authorities, which take far too long to arrive at decisions. I hope that the Minister will tackle that matter. Several hon. Members mentioned empty housing. I noted with interest that the Minister hinted at financial penalties for public authorities which have empty houses on their hands. I did not hear him suggest any equivalent financial penalty when private property remains empty. Perhaps he will think about that. Such a penalty might go some way to increasing supply. However, an increase in supply may not be sufficient. Even with an increased supply, some people will not be able to enter the market. We must consider ways of assisting people into the market. The watchword must be that we must subsidise people, not property. I should like to see a much broader approach to helping people to enter the market. Together with some increase on the supply side, that might bring housing within people's range. Within the Minister's six-point plan to tackle those problems, I noted his reference to speeding up legal procedures. I hope that that will not deprive people of their rights to proceedings in court. The existing procedures for getting orders for possession are fair and should not be changed. However, the enforcement of orders that have been granted needs to be examined as delays occur far too often. Because of lack of time, I shall curtail my comments, but I should like to make a couple of points about the change of landlord provisions in the 1988 Act. Let me sound a warning against the extension of any of those procedures to Northern Ireland as that would open up considerable dangers. Paramilitary groups might apply to acquire public authority estates, and one could not be sure that the Northern Ireland Office would be sufficiently astute to catch them out and stop them. Other bodies such as insurance companies and building societies might seek to take over estates. The danger is that they would be softer targets than the public authorities for pressure from paramilitary groups, although the record of the Housing Executive is pretty bad. But that is another matter. Housing associations make a valuable contribution and have done a considerable amount to increase the supply of housing. They provide an alternative to public authority housing and they should be encouraged, as competition is a good thing. The housing associations are mostly controlled by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive-the public authority to which they should be providing an alternative. With the best will in the world, the Housing Executive often hampers those authorities, although it is not consciously hostile to them, so a different regime is required, and had time permitted perhaps I would have elaborated on that.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,71,housing,829
1990-07-03,"Housing [Statutory Instruments, &C > Opposition Day > Environment]",421,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"The Government are charged with incompetence in their housing policy and with a callous disregard for the welfare of the people of Britain. It is not true that the debate concerns only the rented sector, as the right hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) said. It is very much about the lack of affordable accommodation to rent or for sale in rural and urban areas. Let the Government make no mistake about it: if they simply try to mop up some of the homelessness in London by providing a few extra night shelters, they will find that the pot continues to fill up, not least from areas such as Aylesbury. The growing pressure on housing in rural areas is forcing people out of those areas to the seaside towns and other cities. They move into temporary accommodation, often holiday lets, and become homeless when the accommodation is required. The desperate folly of the Government's policy was to attempt to end council housing without putting anything in its place. I understand that the Government do not like council housing. I think that they are wrong, as do the people who occupy council housing. The people who desperately want to get out of the private sector also think they are wrong. That is why Tory and Labour Members speak to far more people asking for a council house or a housing association house than wishing to move into the private sector. The right hon. Member for Aylesbury was totally and utterly wrong to say that the housing stock is improving. It is decaying fast. The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. If he will not take it from me, I implore him to ask the Association of District Councils. According to that Conservative-controlled organisation, between Â£35 billion and Â£50 billion is needed in housing investment. It is said that the housing stock needs to last for 1,000 years if we are to avoid further decline. Previously the figure was 200 years, and that worries the housing experts. The Government's analysis is desperately and seriously wrong. Several times, the Minister and Conservative Members said that they want to revive the private rented sector. I do not object to that; as long as there are good landlords, I am not fussed. However, the Minister, with his pathetic list of six things, which included issuing documents, is trying to revive a dead parrot. The reason why it is dead is nothing to do with the rent Acts but everything to do with housing finance. That is why, to their credit, the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who was previously the Secretary of State for the Environment and is not normally regarded as a logical man, wanted to end mortgage income tax relief. They wanted to end the subsidy to the buying sector because they knew that either the subsidy to the rented sector had to be increased to make market rents affordable or the subsidy to those who were buying had to be stopped. Labour Members argue that until the Government reform housing finance they cannot get away from the fact that the housing purchase sector and the rented sector must be subsidised. No matter how much the Conservative party wants to get rid of mortgage income tax relief to revive the rented sector, it will not succeed until it makes it almost impossible for increasing numbers of people to buy, even if interest rates come down significantly. That is why house purchase is beyond the reach of between 50 and 60 per cent. of families in southern England. Until they address and understand that problem, it will only get worse. Much of the thinking of the Tory party can be gleaned from the press releases issued by the Minister. He said: "" The Government are determined that there should be no excuse for sleeping-out on the streets."" The image is of thousands of people tucked up nice and warm in their beds at night thinking, "" Isn't it a nuisance; the Government will not give me an excuse to sleep on the streets."" People do not want to sleep on the streets. The Government may try to turn these people into scapegoats and to portray them as wanting to sleep on the streets, but why is it that in all western countries, except in those that follow housing policies similar to ours, such as the United States, the problem is nowhere near as severe, and in most cases does not exist? As I have told the Minister, the big difference between today and 1979 is that when I was a probation officer in the worst areas of London around King's Cross, if a homeless person said to me "" I want accommodation"", I could obtain it for him, whereas today I could not. People must queue for cardboard boxes. That shows the success of the Tory party's housing policy. It is true and I can prove it to Conservative Members. There is a queue also for bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and some people have been in such accommodation for two or three years. The Tory party promised that local authorities would be able to use their capital receipts to invest in housing, but that was not allowed. The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Sir C. Irving) was absolutely right: local authorities could use that money well. It is a tragedy that they are not being allowed to do so. What do the Government intend to do about the crisis in the Housing Corporation? They said: "" It is proposed that in future an increasing proportion of new development by housing associations should be funded by a mixture of grant and private finance. Not only will this make the available public resources stretch further but the injection of market disciplines will itself lead to greater efficiency and make associations more independent and more responsible for the quality and effectiveness of their investment decisions and the competence of their management."" I can only echo the Conservative chair of the housing committee in Plymouth: if local authorities had behaved as the Housing Corporation has behaved, they would be drummed out. The problem is the Government's problem, and we know that the figures in the Department of the Environment's White Paper on public expenditure plans are wrong and misleading. I want to know from the Minister not wild guesses or his invention of 40,000 houses but what the approvals will be for 1990-91 to 1992-93. We need to know whether the Minister is prepared to see the Housing Corporation being examined again by the Public Accounts Committee. Anyone who knows anything about the matter knows that the Public Accounts Committee was deeply worried about the Housing Corporation and knows that its report, which will be out soon, will be of no comfort to the corporation. The tragedy is that the Government, not the Housing Corporation, are truly responsible because the Government created the scheme. The Government say, once again, that they will punish local authorities for keeping properties empty. I am opposed to properties, whether public or private, being kept empty. However, we know that, on average, 2.1 per cent of local authority stock, 3.1 per cent. of housing association stock and 4.5 per cent. of private sector stock is empty. No less than 18 per cent. of Government property is empty. Much of it is in London and includes police officers' houses, prison officers' houses and Ministry of Defence houses, which have been empty for up to 10 years. Will the Government penalise themselves for keeping literally thousands of houses empty? They will not. The Minister may look at his feet and then gaze up at the ceiling; he is responsible for those empty properties. If he penalises local authorities which, on the whole, are good, all he will do is to aggravate the problem. The Minister should say what the Labour party says. Where we have examples of bad landlordism, whether by councils, by housing associations or by the Government, we should use one of the other sectors to get those houses into use. We shall say to the private sector what I have been saying to it, successfully, for a long time. There are successful partnerships, but if the Minister believes that he will encourage the letting of flats above shops simply by making it easier to get people out again, he is wrong. The person who has a shop needs the confidence of knowing that if he has a bad tenant who, for example, ruins his stock pouring water through the ceiling, he can get him out, not in six months, but the next day. There is only one way in which to do that without throwing people on to the street and that is to use lease-hack. If the Government would release some of the controls on lease-back, one could achieve that. The Opposition object to the way in which the Government have squeezed the private rented sector out of existence. The hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) is right to say that in Northern Ireland 25 per cent. of the rented stock was private in 1957; now it is only 5 per cent. Yet no one has threatened the reintroduction of rent controls in Northern Ireland. The Government's plans do not add up to a sensible policy, as anyone who knows anything about housing knows. If one wants to bring areas into use, one should use sensible lease-back schemes and begin to reform housing finance. One could then deliver the policies that this country needs. We cannot continue with a disgrace that is unique to the western world, with the exception of the United States. We have teenage children-I emphasise the word "" children"" -begging in our streets. It is wrong and we know that it is wrong. It is unnecessary and comes about as a result of an incompetent Government who do not know one end of the housing market from the other.",5857,"['Statutory Instruments, &C', 'Opposition Day', 'Environment']",Housing,3,72,housing,1677

1990-07-03,"Housing [Statutory Instruments, &C > Opposition Day > Environment]",424,Christopher Chope,Con,False,"Certainly, there has been a lot of success under the Housing Act 1988. Take tenants' choice, for example. Tenants' choice has shaken to the core the complacency of Labour housing authorities. As a result, even the worst Labour housing authorities now realise that, because there is a choice, they must buck up their standards, otherwise tenants will opt out. The Conservative party believes in freeing up the market. We believe in supply side measures. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) called for more competition and showed decisively how more competition is needed, rather than more control and restriction, for which the Opposition argue. We believe that supply side measures will bring more empty properties back into use. That is true not just in the private sector, but in the public sector, where the introduction of the ring-fenced housing revenue account is already having an impact. Tenants of inefficient councils throughout the country now realise that they will have to pay more in rent or suffer lower standards of service if their council landlords cannot turn round their properties more quickly and make better use of their housing stock. My hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Sir C. Irving) made an impassioned plea for more of the proceeds of sales to be released for use by the councils. I have to tell my hon. Friend that the local authorities' outstanding debt is about Â£40 billion. That is a massive debt burden. We think that it is reasonable that, if a council sells an asset, it should use part of the proceeds of the sale to pay back some of its debt. My hon. Friend's own council, Cheltenham, had outstanding debts worth Â£54 million at 31 March 1989. That is a substantial sum and it is reasonable that, if the council sells some of its assets, it should use some of the proceeds of the sale to repay part of its debt. It is the Labour party's policy to borrow and borrow and to saddle future generations with massive burdens. That policy has been referred to again this evening by Opposition Members. It is the policy of Conservative Members to encourage the sale of surplus assets and allow part of those proceeds to be reinvested. My right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) said that, even in areas such as Aylesbury Vale, families had problems in trying to find housing. I know that that is true. But it is fair to say that in the first quarter of this year only three families in Aylesbury Vale were in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. In Cheltenham, there were no families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation and no one in a hostel. The relative housing needs of those areas have to be compared with the much greater housing needs of the inner cities. Having said that, I should point out that the Housing Corporation's special rural programme is not affected by any legal problem-as the hon. Member for Perry Barr suggested-and, as we know, that programme will provide 1,500 new units per annum for rent and 350 for sale, to be concentrated in villages with a population of less than 1,000. That programme is being brought into effect as we speak. There are still some detailed legal arrangements to be sorted out, but there is no fundamental problem. The debate has shown that the Opposition are still clinging to the failed socialist culture of the 1960s and 1970s.

1990-07-17,Housing,269,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"The information will be valuable because I want to refer to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) has just raised. The 24th report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments made much criticism of the grant order. One should bear in mind the fact that it arises from the Local Government and Housing Act 1989-a measure which, in its own right, caused enormous problems for the House and which was badly drafted. We now have a statutory instrument arising from that Bill-now an Act of Parliament-which is itself badly drafted. The instrument was drafted by the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), who was previously Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and before that Secretary of State for the Environment. I can only assume that he drafted the instrument himself because it was his habit to draft Bills and statutory instruments. When the right hon. Gentleman drafted this instrument, he must have been dwelling on the outcome of the second world war because it is the only way in which one can account for some of the absurdities to which the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has drawn attention. Some of the defects in the drafting will cause only relatively-I emphasise that word-minor problems to the public and to local authorities. However, there are enough unusual cases to cause considerable concern. What does the claimant do who makes a claim for a grant, but who is then told that the definition-or the interpretation by the local authority-does not accord with what he understands to be the case from the order itself? Presumably he has to go to law. We know from what the Statutory Instruments Committee has said that there is sufficient imprecision about the drafting to almost welcome legal cases. That means that an individual claimant has to take out a case himself with all the time, trouble and expense that that involves. One of the most disconcerting aspects of the drafting is the reference to "" voluntary body"" or "" voluntary organisation"". When we debated this in Committee we all thought that we knew what type of organisation we were talking about. It transpires from a Department of the Environment answer to the Select Committee that "" voluntary body"" or "" voluntary organisation"" can include commercial organisations. The answer said that it does not "" exclude"" commercial organisations, so they must be included. That will cause considerable confusion and difficulty when people are deciding what grant level someone is eligible for. There will also be problems over the definition of student grants and the difference between earnings and income. That was another point made by the Statutory Instruments Committee. The definition of a deed of covenant is perhaps the most clear-cut legal case. In many instances the deeds of covenant will be legally enforceable and will, therefore, determine what the income or earnings are. In those circumstances, the Department of the Environment seems to take the view that it need simply leave the matter to the discretion of the local authority. How on earth can a local authority have discretion over something decided by a court of law? If a local authority wants to avoid paying a grant, it can use its discretion and refuse to provide it. In such a case, the claimant would have to go to court. He would probably win his case, but the time and expense involved would make it more likely that many claimants would not pursue their request for a grant. As I said, the statutory instrument arises out of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. In the debates on that Bill the Minister gave assurances about means testing and the fact that the Government were introducing a better system for home improvement grants. I admit to the Minister that it is better as it can provide grants of up to 100 per cent. That is welcome. I was going to say that the Minister has gone badly wrong, but it would be difficult to interpret it as such. In fact, he has gone intentionally wrong by limiting the number of people who can receive such a grant much more drastically than in the past. I do not believe that it is an accident that we had Government speaker after Government speaker during the debate on the Finance Bill in order to prevent us from reaching this debate before 10 o'clock. What we are debating now will affect many hundreds of thousands or possibly millions of people who would previously have received grants to repair their houses but who will no longer receive one or will receive a reduced amount. That is a matter of serious concern. The statutory instrument is drafted in such a way that the means test will ensure that people on relatively modest incomes and low incomes will have less opportunity for repair and renovation of their housing. People on higher incomes will also have less opportunity. The Government's own housing conditions survey of 1986 pointed out that 500,000 properties in Britain lack basic amenities, 1 million were unfit-about 5.6 per cent. of the total housing stock-and 1.1 million were in serious disrepair. I again pray in aid my old friends and supporting colleagues, the Association of District Councils. It is a Conservative-controlled body, but it is constantly pointing out that the Government's lack of a housing strategy is leading to a declining state of repair of the British housing stock. That is why it says that a minimum of Â£35 billion and a maximum of Â£50 billion must be spent by the end of the century if the problem is not to escalate. The housing conditions survey, the ADC-a Conservative-controlled body-and other Conservative-controlled organisations, as well as the Labour party and almost every housing organisation in the country, are telling the Government that they have got it wrong. If the Government do not want the housing stock in Britain to continue to decline, they should take the regulations away and draft them properly. They should ensure not only that the regulations do not contain the contradictions to which the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments drew attention but that people can obtain grants so that the state of the housing stock in Britain can be improved. The way in which the Government have fixed the contributions means that people on low and modest incomes will have to make larger contributions than expected. That means that many people will not take up the grant. That is why I say that the number of people who obtain grants and go ahead with repairs will drop. The Government should look again at regulation 8 and increase the figure from Â£20 to a minimum of Â£40-preferably to Â£60. Those figures have been calculated not just by me but by many other people. If we set the level at Â£60, we could prevent the housing stock from slipping into further disrepair. If the figure is below Â£60, the most that we shall manage to do is to mark time and to ensure that matters do not get any worse. If the figure is left at Â£20, the housing stock will get worse. Without going into the complicated details of the way in which the system works, I should explain that the Â£20 acts as a multiplier for the amount that one can obtain. Let us take the example of a family with a net income of Â£8,000. Under the old regulations, which expired on 30 June this year, that family would have received a 75 per cent. grant in respect of repair costs of Â£8,000. From 1 July, the same family will find its grant reduced from 75 per cent. to about 53 per cent. That family will get considerably less than it would have received under the old regime which ended a few weeks ago. Families with incomes of between Â£10,000 and Â£12,800 will receive only 1 per cent. grant in respect of a repair bill of Â£8,000. Are the Government seriously asking the House and the public to accept that family incomes of between Â£10,000 and Â£12,800 are sufficient to enable people to find repair costs-particularly in the south of Britain, where repairs are especially expensive-on the basis of a 1 per cent. grant? That is nonsense and the Government must know it. The Government must also know that that will lead to a reduction in the number of repairs being done. It is not that the Government want fewer repairs to be done. They want to spend less money, but in doing that they will exacerbate the state of disrepair of the British housing stock, which will not only add to the misery of people in bad housing but will increase the bill in future. The Government's neglect of the railway and sewerage systems and the rest of the infrastructure in Britain has led to a similar decline. A single parent would get a 100 per cent. grant on a Â£10,000 repair only if his or her income was below Â£93 a week, and no assistance whatever if he or she earned more than Â£191 a week. A single person without a child would receive a 100 per cent. grant only if his or her income was below Â£50 a week. That is a further indication that the Government are not serious about the disrepair of our housing stock. The Â£20 figure in regulation 8 needs to be set at Â£60 if we are to reverse the deterioration of our housing stock. My next point concerns the savings disregard-the amount of savings that people may have without losing grant. The means test is a big let-down, not only on the Government's proposal in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 but on some of the commitments that they gave both to the House of Lords and to this House. During our debates on the 1989 Act, the Minister suggested that there could be a passport. In other words, if one was getting certain other state benefits and one's savings had already been taken into account, the assumption could be carried over to grants and so on; the savings disregard would be equal. But instead of sticking to that and keeping the figures the same, the Government changed them yet again. We now have a savings disregard of Â£8,000 for people on income support or family credit; of Â£16,000 for those on poll tax or housing benefit; and, now, of Â£5,000 for the purposes of the statutory instrument. That is despite the fact that, in Committee and in the House of Lords, the Government gave a commitment to ensure that there was passporting of a similar type to ensure that the savings disregard was kept as compatible as possible with the other benefits to make it simple.",6071,[],Housing,0,4,housing,1809
1990-07-17,Housing,270,Christopher Chope,Con,False,"I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the new disregards are more generous, because they have no upper limit and the minimum disregard is Â£5,000.",6071,[],Housing,0,5,housing,26
1990-07-17,Housing,271,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"I know that the minimum is Â£5,000. But if the Minister is to be consistent with what was said in Committee, he must operate the same limit as those applying to housing and poll tax benefits. The Minister cannot say that he is going to keep it the same for the various benefits, and then, a year or so later, change it. That is what the Government have done. We were told in Committee-on the Floor of the House-that means testing would be simple and comparable with other benefits. It is not; it is quite complex. Does the Minister argue that it is a simple system now? Perhaps he will address that question in his speech. Additional premiums are allowed for the disabled and for those over 75. However, that will be affected by the basic means test. It should be remembered that the House of Lords passed that part of the primary legislation only on the basis of Government assurances that means testing would be simple and comparable. The Minister has a duty to both Houses to clarify the matter. I am also disappointed that the home insulation grant is to be discretionary. The Government made an amazing commitment some time ago, and only a few weeks ago the Secretary of State for the Environment emphasised again, on the Floor of the House, that Britain would reduce its CO2 emissions. Here was an opportunity to do that, and to increase expenditure on the insulation of homes. That would save energy, reduce fuel prices and often enable people to have more disposable income, thus benefiting them, the country and the environment. With the poll tax and Government cuts, local authorities will find it difficult to give discretionary grants. They will fulfil their commitment on the mandatory grants and then squeeze the discretionary grants as much as possible, not because it is in the interests of local authorities-whether Tory or Labour-but because they have no option. The alternative would be to allow the poll tax to go up again. That is the only way to pay for the grant. So much for the green credentials of the Secretary of State for the Environment. When we compare British housing stock to that of many European countries on a similar latitude, we find that they spend much more and make a greater effort to insulate homes than we do. As a result, they have better energy savings returns that enable people on lower incomes to spend less on energy. That is of benefit to everyone. The Government's green credentials and their commitment to improve housing have suddenly begun to look a bit shaky. I also want specifically to know what on earth we are to do about the weird time warp in which the Government have put local authorities and individuals. The old system will come to an end on 31 July, and this instrument will not come into effect for a while. For some months, people who have had emergency work to be done have got reports from surveyors saying that such work must be done immediately because, if it is not, the problem will get worse. I refer to problems such as dry rot and other things that spread rapidly in houses. Those people have gone to their local authorities and asked for a grant. Local authorities have then said, "" We shall file your claim, but we cannot do anything about it because we do not know what the rules are, and we shall not know what the rules are for some time.""",6071,[],Housing,0,6,housing,593
1990-07-17,Housing,272,Ian McCartney,Lab,False,On 1 December last year I wrote to the Secretary of State about that matter. The Under-Secretary of State replied refusing to meet me on that point on the basis that his Department had written to my local authority giving an explanation of why changes were taking place in regard to funding for this financial year. When I saw a copy of the minutes of the discussions between the Department and my local authority it became clear that the Government had been dishonest about their intentions about the resources being provided for this financial year. He still refused to meet me to discuss the requirements of and resources for local authorities. Will my hon. Friend ask the Secretary of State why he has refused to meet Opposition Members to discuss investment in local authority contributions to the private sector and upgrading houses in the private sector while he is reducing grants to local authorities on this issue?,6071,[],Housing,0,7,housing,157
1990-07-17,Housing,273,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend makes an important point. It might not have escaped his notice that we have had six or seven Ministers with responsibility for housing matters in the past five years. I am beginning to lose count of them. The present Minister, I am told, will not be with the Department much longer. One of the things that strikes me when I raise such issues and examine the answers that are given is the way in which Ministers abuse the parliamentary process by refusing not just to meet hon. Members but to give clear answers to questions. Without straying out of order, the most obvious example arose during the Housing Corporation crisis. Ministers refused to give figures for the next three years, even though they were obviously wrong in the Department of the Environment's expenditure White Paper. The issue is serious. People are caught in a time warp. A local authority cannot give a grant, but, more important, it is doubly trapped. It might want to give a grant and might consider that a person was entitled to it, but, unless it can approve the work in accordance with the terms of the statutory instrument, it cannot give the go-ahead. Will the Minister allow some retrospection so that local authorities will be able to assess properly audited receipts and people who could not get a local authority grant because there is no legislation covering it can do emergency work, and allow local authorities to use their discretion and give grants, particularly mandatory grants, in such circumstances? The matter is important. It will affect many people, in particular those who have work which needs to be done urgently and which a surveyor has said must be done urgently. I accept that that would have to be part of the evidence presented to a local authority. An important matter for many people and for the housing stock generally is who pays. The Government are anxious to squeeze the grant system so that it spends less money, because the only way in which a local authority can pay for housing repairs and renovation is the poll tax. Local authorities will squeeze discretionary grants to keep down the poll tax, and they will give mandatory grants because they have no option. That means that matters such as energy conservation will be pushed aside as being marginal and of no great consequence, whereas they should be much more central to the Government's strategy. We know that the Government are in financial difficulty, not just in terms of running the economy but in getting themselves out of the poll tax trap. There is no excuse whatsoever for putting on to local authorities the responsibility for getting the Government out of that mess. The Government need to ensure that we have a grant system that improves the repair and renovation of British housing stock so that it does not continue to decline in the way in which many Conservative Members, as well as many local authorities, have been telling the Minister for years that it is declining. The Government need to do something about that today because the decline will continue until the Minister reverses these policies.",6071,[],Housing,0,8,housing,531
1990-07-17,Housing,274,Bob Cryer,Lab,False,"As I said in my earlier point of order, Mr. Speaker, the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has reported the instrument to the House on the grounds of defective drafting. Although I propose to deal with this matter as quickly as possible, it is important that the House should recognise that the majority of the Government's vast legislative programme is being dealt with by means of subordinate legislation. The House should also recognise that the Government, who claimed that they would take legislation off the citizens' backs, are producing more statutory instruments of one sort or another than the previous Labour Government. About 2,500 statutory instruments are being progressed through the House every year because of the way in which the Government are producing more regulations, rather than fewer. In itself, that is not a bad thing, but it shows that the Government's claim to be taking regulations away is simply not true. It is also important that the Government should try, to the best of their ability-and they certainly have a great number of resources on which to call-to make legislation as clear as possible. It is worth recalling that this is a negative procedure instrument which would not have been debated but for the Opposition prayer.

1990-07-17,Housing,276,Bob Cryer,Lab,False,"I do not deny the possibility that the Committee has overlooked defects in other instruments. The Committee deals with the vast majority of the 2,500 or more statutory instruments presented to Parliament every year and I have no doubt that some defects are overlooked. Departments often argue that wording which we claim is defective has been used previously, but that is no argument in justification of the existing statutory instrument. If the Minister wants to make a criticism, it is a criticism of past Committees that have overlooked defective wording. The Committee must take its guidance from the Counsel to you, Mr. Speaker, who is also Counsel to the Committee. If the Counsel or a member of the Committee finds that an instrument is defective in one respect, and it follows another instrument, I should have thought that the Committee was to be commended, not criticised. The Committee is quite open in saying, "" Yes, we need all the help that we can get."" We must recognise that the Committee meets weekly at 4.15 pm. with just one Counsel and an assistant to help it. We should have more resources, not less."" Many instruments are corrected without ever having been reported to the House because Counsel to the Committee contacts Departments to point out defects. Helpful Departments frequently say, "" All right, we will withdraw the instrument-we recognise the defects and we will remedy them.""

1990-07-17,Housing,277,James Lamond,Lab,False,I am following my hon. Friend's argument as closely as possible. Is he saying that his Committee has before it on average between 60 and 70 statutory instruments at every meeting?,6071,[],Housing,0,12,housing,31
1990-07-17,Housing,278,Bob Cryer,Lab,False,"Yes, that is absolutely correct. For example, after the recess we shall have more than 100 instruments before us. They will have accumulated during the recess. We agreed only today to meet on the first Tuesday we are back so as to avoid a backlog building up. We recognise that it is difficult for the Committee to take all the instruments into account. If it is difficult for the Committee, it is also difficult for the ordinary citizen. A copy of the statutory instrument with which we are dealing today costs Â£5.15. That does not exactly encourage the dissemination of information affecting citizens. It runs to some 35 pages, including three schedules and many clauses. Without any shadow of doubt it is a complicated piece of legislation equivalent to a primary Act of Parliament. All that the Committee is saying is that several matters require elucidation. That is why we have reported it to the House. Whether the people who use the instrument will receive the guidance from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments is in doubt. Perhaps as a gesture and to help people at large the Minister will agree to publish and distribute all the Committee's comments with the instrument. I have no doubt that the Minister will be keen to make a suitable response. The report lists seven areas in which the drafting is defective. I shall not go through them all. The report is available. It was dealt with by the Committee today. We discussed it so that we could put it in the Vote Office for Members to obtain and read. For example, in the first paragraph of our report we refer to the definition of a voluntary body and a voluntary organisation. Regulation 4(2)(f) in the instrument says: "" This paragraph applies to- ...(f) a person who lives with the relevant person in order to care for him or a partner of his and who is engaged by a charitable or voluntary body (other than a public or local authority)"". The Department says that a voluntary body includes an ordinary commercial company or, at least, does not exclude such a company. The Department also says that the expressions "" properly bear their ordinary meaning"". We say that it is impossible to reconcile an ordinary commercial body with a voluntary body or organisation. Those are confusing matters for the people in local authorities who will have to use the instruments. They will have to decide who are qualifying persons. There is a real possibility that where the definition is cloudy it will be referred to a court. That is a defect in Parliament. If we allow shoddy legislation through, whether primary or delegated legislation, which has to be decided in the courts because it is defective, we shall hand over the power of decision-making to the courts. That is not what we were elected for. Regulation 16(2) refers to "" income derived under regulations 27 and 28"". As no income can be derived under a regulation of a statutory instrument, we have drawn the attention of the House to the matter. The Department has said that it will consider the wording at the first convenient opportunity. That means that it will amend the wording in a further statutory instrument-at least, one hopes that it will-when it finds a statutory instrument which can be linked with this one in the index. That means that people will have to buy another instrument and to know the indexing in order to link it up to find the new definition. That illustrates the difficulties for ordinary people and for local authorities who use the instruments that the Government produce. How can payments under a legally enforceable deed of covenant be treated under paragraph 13 of schedule 3 as a voluntary payment? The Department has suggested that that is reconcilable, but the Committee believes that it is doubtful that a legally enforceable deed of covenant can be regarded as voluntary. Local authorities will be called upon to decide whether compulsory payments are voluntary, but that is a complete opposite in terms and it will be a difficult task for a local authority to undertake. That might also lead to a challenge in the courts, which would be a waste of everyone's time and money when we could get things right in the first place. The Minister should consider an amending instrument to remedy the seven poor definitions, which were badly drafted in the original statutory instrument. The Committee has an obligation to report items in any instrument that it regards as badly drafted. Although the seven badly drafted definitions may make up only a small proportion of the instrument and only a small proportion of the users of the instrument will come up against them, it is worth the Department considering an amending instrument to cover those seven items. That instrument should be available free to the purchasers of the primary instrument, for which they will pay Â£5.15. I have not mentioned the merits of the instrument because our Committee does not consider the merits of statutory instruments and therefore I have not gone outside the Committee's remit. Of course we want to see housing renovation carried out. That is the purpose of the housing renovation system, particularly as a large part of the stock consists of older dwellings which fall within the definition of those eligible for housing renovation grants. That is important. It is therefore also important that the legislation which defines such eligibility should be clear, succinct and transparently available to the user as well as to Ministers, hon. Members and draftsmen in the Department. The user should see the statutory instrument not as an obstacle, but as the means of obtaining a benefit which, if it improves the housing stock, is a benefit to the nation. It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to consider providing an amending instrument to clarify and improve the statutory instrument for free issue with it.",6071,[],Housing,0,13,housing,996

Many people with higher than average incomes received grants, renovated houses and flats and made a profit on them.

Gentleman is that it is too early to say. The grants of which I am speaking are mandatory. People on low incomes will be entitled to help with up to 100 per cent. of the cost of the work, not 90 per cent. of the cost as before. Therefore, it is impossible to say how much the budget will be. If one believed the rhetoric of the hon. Member for Hammersmith, one would assume that a Labour Government would want to ensure that such discretionary grants were mandatory. When the Opposition spokesman winds up, I would be interested to know if that is Labour policy. What will its policy be towards those discretionary grants to improve homes above the basic fitness standard? Such grants should not be mandatory grants from local authorities. Is it the Labour policy that they should, and how much money is the Labour party prepared to put behind that idea to make it a reality?",6071,[],Housing,0,22,housing,185

One would have thought from the rhetoric that its Members are using this evening that 11 years ago the Labour party would have thought of that, and would have put it into effect. When we discussed the matter in Committee and considered the various options before us, we realised that there were a number of ways in which to introduce an improved scheme for home improvements. We could say that there are some spheres in which we want improvements to be made, and that beyond that people should pay for the improvements themselves. We all know the sort of area about which we are talking. We want properties to be bought up, and we do not want any of the houses or flats to be left out. The argument leading to that conclusion suggests that, if dwellings were left out, it could lead to pepper-potting-there would be good houses, and unfit houses. It is an attractive argument, but I am glad that the Government did not pursue it. I am glad that the Government chose the policy they did because I think that it is important that those people on poor incomes, living in unfit houses, and with no means or reasonable income, should be entitled to a grant paying for the whole cost of the work, as of right. This is an important scheme. The Government were right to introduce it, and I certainly hope that my hon. Friends will support them in the Lobbies tonight.",6071,[],Housing,0,24,housing,276
1990-07-17,Housing,290,Richard Livsey,LibDem,False,"I do not possess the mastery of statutory instruments of the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer), but I have grave doubts about some of the principles in the regulations. The grants fall into two categories: mandatory grants, which, as long as the statutory requirements are met, the council is obliged to pay; and discretionary grants, when the council can decide which type of work to assist and which class of applicant to help. The percentage of such grants can be altered, too. The retrograde principle behind the new system-it represents a major change-is that all applicants for grants will be means tested. That cannot be good. Applicants will be eligible for grant if their resources, including income and capital, are below certain thresholds. The danger lies in where those thresholds are set; on that depends which people will fail to get a grant-to say nothing of the Â£20 top-up. Discretionary grants will be available for works that bring properties up to target standards. Much of the debate has centred on those targets. Mandatory grants are available on top of renovation grants provided to disabled people. The transmission of resources to where they are most needed is desirable, but the targets in this case should apply to properties, not people. That has not been sufficiently discussed so far. In Wales, where many of the houses were built before 1919, many properties are substandard and the housing stock is in extremely bad shape, although I concede that much good work has been done to bring it up to standard. There is still, however, a long way to go. The means tests are usually excessively restrictive and degrading, and they always throw up anomalies. The forms are long and intrusive and they represent an obstacle course for people at the bottom of the pile who have to thread their way through them. Many give up at the first hurdle. The test is modelled on the housing benefit scheme, and it may exhibit similar problems. The proposed scheme is cumbersome and labour-intensive. It is estimated that it will increase local government's workload by at least 15 per cent. due to the administration of applications and the surveying and assessment of properties. We believe that the Â£20 top-up is not generous enough. It should be at least doubled. It will certainly not cover the many necessary outgoings-over and above the usual expenses-that a household may face. High interest and mortgage rates have not even been taken into account-",6071,[],Housing,0,25,housing,415

Another 9,000 houses have been designated by the Government and the local authority as requiring initiatives to prevent them from being demolished.

1990-07-17,Housing,294,Richard Livsey,LibDem,False,"The hon. Gentleman makes a telling intervention, which could be described by some as a telling speech. Areas such as those represented by the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members have problems with housing stock. The hon. Gentleman has rightly said that considerable resources are required to tackle those problems. Councils are struggling to put right housing that is falling down around them. The proposal to disregard Â£5,000 of savings is not generous enough for people such as the elderly and the disabled who may rely on their life savings to supplement their income. Some people have no prospect of replacing their savings. Perhaps people such as the elderly and the disabled should be totally exempt from the means test. I object in principle to such a test and a cogent case against it can certainly be made for the elderly and the disabled. Its removal would reduce the work load on local authorities and lift a burden from people's shoulders. The loans test is applied across the board whether or not a person is considered to be a good risk, and many elderly, disabled and other people may find that loans are denied to them. That is unfair. In theory, the scheme has potential for good, especially for the elderly, because it holds out the prospect of a 100 per cent. grant. However, without adequate funds the system, or part of it, may grind to a halt, and I fear that that will happen to the renovation grants scheme. The scheme will limit the number of people who are eligible for grant and its complex system of means testing will exclude people in need. It is a cynical exercise in cost saving at the expense of poor people. Apart from the problems that face people, many properties are in need of renovation in their own right. The housing stock will continue to deteriorate because assistance will be available for fewer properties. The regulations are inappropriate, mainly because of their element of means testing. The regulations are also unfair and will not tackle a serious social problem.",6071,[],Housing,0,29,housing,347
1990-07-17,Housing,295,George Howarth,Lab,False,"I shall deal first with the questions posed by the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes). We welcome the provision for discretionary grants and we shall extend it in legislation. Obviously, I am not prepared to say what a Labour Government would be able to afford in two years. Neither the hon. Gentleman nor the Government know what next year's Budget will be and would not tell us if they did. Over time, we would want the home insulation grant to become mandatory. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) highlighted the position of his constituents in Wigan, and of people in the north-west, as a result of the statutory instrument and the legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer), through the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, made some trenchant criticisms about the sloppy drafting of the measure and its defects. It is all of a piece with this Government and the way in which they deal with housing. It is a long-standing series of incompetent measures, all of which have been compounded by the regulations and orders that have followed. It is sad, although not surprising, that again the Government have missed the opportunity to do something useful. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) cited figures from the 1986 house condition survey and its conclusions on properties lacking in basic amenities or in fitness, or which were in serious disrepair. More than 14 per cent. of the properties covered by the survey fall into one or other of those categories. That is bad enough in itself, and it gives a clear picture of the problems with the housing stock. My hon. Friend described the effects of the statutory instrument and noted that those on a net income of between Â£8,000 and Â£12,800 would suffer a grant reduction of, in the former case, from 75 per cent. to 53 per cent. and, in the latter case, to 1 per cent. on an Â£8,000 repair. If we juxtapose those figures with the figures in the 1986 house condition survey, 20 per cent. of the households that need one or other of the categories of major repair will be caught within the trap of this measure. Many households-not large-income, but low-income households-will fall outside the scope of eligibility for assistance with necessary works. Even the capital cut-off in the measure is at odds with other areas of Government policy. In this case, it becomes operative at Â£5,000; it is Â£8,000 for income support and family credit and Â£6,000-we all know the background to this-for housing benefit and the poll tax. There is a series of different capital cut-off points applying to different areas of benefit.

1990-07-17,Housing,299,George Howarth,Lab,False,"That is not my reading of it. I shall check and, if the hon. Gentleman is right, I shall write to him. Schedule 1 to the reduction of grant regulations allows for an additional premium in certain circumstances. In particular, these premiums apply to the disabled, to those designated as higher premium pensioners-those over 75-and to certain other disadvantaged people. The regulations allow for an additional premium to be paid to certain categories, which, in effect, increases the home improvement grant payable to the disabled. All these premiums relate to the basic principle of means testing. Therefore, unless those basic principles are set out fairly, the corresponding premiums will be affected by the anomaly of the basic means test. For that reason, it is important to try to overturn the two requirements identified, but there is an added argument in relation to the knock-on effect that this will have on the disabled and other disadvantaged persons. Ministers gave particular assurances about the disabled to both Houses of Parliament, and only after assurances in the House of Lords was the primary legislation for the means-testing principle passed. I do not believe that the regulations as laid meet those assurances. For that reason, they are unsatisfactory. The Government have been making soothing noises to local authorities, telling them that Â£54 million is available for supplementary bids so that extra work can be carried out. As I understand it, the local authorities in my area alone, Merseyside, would need to take up Â£14 million of that money. By extrapolation, we see that that money will not be adequate to cover the shortfalls. The Government should again consider the amount that they are soothingly telling local authorities to apply for. I started by saying that this incompetence built upon inactivity is all of a piece with this Government. My hon. Friends have referred to the sloppy drafting of the regulations.

The Government have consistency in these regulations. That does not mean that the drafting of regulations can never be improved. The points made by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) will be taken into account in further drafts of these and the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987.

The facts are set out clearly in the circular of guidance and in the booklet, two million copies of which have been made available for ordinary people who wish to take advantage of the new and far more generous system of renovation grants. Throughout the debate there has been a misunderstanding by the Opposition of the rules about capital disregards. Regulation 37 provides for a tariff income to be calculated in respect of capital in excess of Â£5,000 only. That is more generous than under the housing benefit regulations. There is no cut-off point. Reference has been made to the cut-off points of Â£8,000 and Â£16,000, but there is no cut-off point under the regulations.

I gave the example of a person on Â£191 a week who would receive only 1 per cent. grant.",6071,[],Housing,0,38,housing,102
1990-07-17,Housing,304,Christopher Chope,Con,False,"That would not apply to a person on a very low income or to a person who has very low capital resources. The new system will give 100 per cent. grants to people, which was not possible under the old system. That is why the new system is properly targeted to those in greatest need. Unlike the old system, under which people could receive only a 90 per cent. grant up to a maximum amount for the works, the new system has no limit on the maximum amount of works that can be carried out. Thus, for example, a person on a low income who had low capital might be able to obtain Â£20,000 as a 100 per cent. grant for works that were carried out. There are many worked examples that show just how generous the new system will be. It is rather odd that the Opposition should try to suggest that the system is other than generous. Under the new system, there is also minor works assistance which will be available especially for the benefit of the elderly. That will be available to help with insulation work, about which the hon. Member for Hammersmith was concerned. The new system takes account of that. However, it does not-and I do not think it should-give every person 100 per cent. grant, as of right, for insulation work. Under the new system, people can receive grant assistance if they are in particular need, and I should have thought that that was a far fairer and more sensible way in which to distribute scarce resources belonging to the taxpayer. The Labour party has throughout been rather against means testing. Tonight, the only outright opposition to means testing was from the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Livsey). However, just in case there are people who still belong to the Labour party who think that the Labour party is against means testing and, by implication, against means testing for renovation grants, I should remind the House that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) told the Institute of Housing conference a few weeks ago that the Labour party still supported means testing and that all it was thinking about was "" rejigging the means test"". That is the expression that the hon. Gentleman used. He looks puzzled; perhaps he does not read his own speeches. That points to a further area of confusion in the Labour party's policies. It will try to make everybody believe that 100 per cent. grants will be available for everybody without any means test, but it is clear that it recognises that it is much fairer to have a system of means testing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) made clear during his important contribution to the debate, the Government's record on improving the nation's housing stock is exemplary and stands comparison with the record of any previous Labour Government. My hon. Friend understated the position. He said that there had been a 50 per cent. increase in real terms in the resources put into home renovations last year compared with 10 years ago. In fact, there has been a 100 per cent. increase in real terms in the money put into home improvements. That is why in the legislation we have been able to extend the categories and definitions so that more properties can be defined as unfit. In that way we can further improve the quality of the housing stock. I predict that it will not be long before Opposition Members suggest that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of unfit properties during the lifetime of the Government. Opposition Members are nodding already. The numbers will have increased because we have widened the criteria and, thereby, improved the standards. That shows the way in which-dare I say it-the Opposition are prepared to resort to a form of cheating in their selective use of statistics. Since 1979 more than Â£4 billion has been spent on more than 1.2 million grants to help people improve and renovate homes in the private sector. Spending has increased significantly. One of the most important parts of the new regulations is the major new assistance they provide for the disabled. The elements of the grants for the disabled have been widely recognised and accepted as being helpful to the disabled. They fit in well with the Government's policies on care in the community and enabling people to stay in their own homes. I am sorry that during the debate no Opposition Member has praised the new system and given credit where it is due. It is worth pointing out that a newspaper that is not normally very generous in its support for Government policies carried an article last month with the heading, "" Home improvement grants better"". It said: "" A more generous system of home improvement aid to be launched on July 1 features mandatory grants of up to 100 per cent. of repair and renovation costs for both the low-paid and the disabled. Housing experts have welcomed the new system as a distinct improvement"". I do not know whether that journalist will continue in employment with The Guardian after writing that article. If The Guardian thinks that the new system is better, it is churlish of the Opposition not to be prepared to accept the major improvements that have been introduced. I commend the regulations to the House. I hope that hon. Members of both sides of the House will support them in the Lobby. As there are a couple of minutes left, I shall tell the House of a fully worked example which shows how generous the new system is. An elderly couple aged over 60, one of whom is disabled and receives an attendance or mobility allowance and with a net weekly income of Â£130-totalling about Â£6,779 a year-would be able to obtain a grant of Â£18,285 for works costing Â£20,000.

1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],215,Bryan Gould,Lab,False,"There is no mystery about housing in Britain. There is a growing housing crisis for two main and obvious reasons. First, we have failed to build enough houses and, secondly, the cost of housing has risen so fast that decent housing is now beyond the reach of a significant number of people. Those factors are a direct consequence of Government policy and there will be no improvement until there is a change of policy or, indeed, a change of Government. The facts can be stated simply. The number of houses built in the 1980s was the lowest in any peacetime decade in this century. The 1990s have started even less promisingly. Housing starts for 1990 totalled only 184,000 and few people doubt that there will be a still sharper fall this year.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,3,housing,132

1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],217,Bryan Gould,Lab,False,"No, I have only just started. I shall give way very sparingly in view of the short time available. The total figures are bad enough. However, the real pain is felt when we consider social and affordable housing. That is the sector where there has been the most damaging decline and where it hurts most. In 1978-the last year of the Labour Government-local authorities built 92,000 houses in England and Wales. That figure had fallen to a mere 13,000 by 1990 and it will fall still further this year. Indeed, it is the deliberate aim of Government policy-so we are told-that the figure should fall to zero very soon. Presumably, the intention is for the gap to be made up by housing associations and by the private sector. That has not happened. Housing associations completed a mere 8,873 homes for rent in 1989-that is a welcome contribution, but nowhere near the scale required. The private sector-after a period in the mid-1980s when, it must be said, it was not social but luxury housing that was built-also suffered a sharp decline. In fact, it is gripped by the severest recession for decades. The latest state of trade survey conducted in March and published in May by the Building Employers Confederation shows that the steep downward trend in output continues. The balance between those reporting higher and lower output has fallen for the ninth successive quarter to minus 70 per cent. That is the lowest figure on record. The industry predicts that 150,000 jobs will be lost this year. Skills will be lost, never to return. Business failures are at record levels and they include long-established family firms. They are the facts about the supply of new housing. The facts about the cost of housing are no less powerful. Home owners were lured into home ownership by the boom, which was helped by the shortage of supply and they were then trapped by soaring interest rates. As a result, home ownership has become an impossible dream for many and an impossible nightmare for many more. The number of repossessions, which stood at 46,940 in the year to March, has doubled in a year and it is predicted to double again in the coming year. Few would quarrel with that prediction. A Bank of England study which was recently published shows that 784,000-or one in 12-loans are two months or more in arrears. It is not surprising that homelessness due to arrears increased by 58 per cent. in the first quarter of 1991, and it is a major factor in the increasing burden placed on local authorities. Tenants have found housing costs no easier to face. Private rents have risen sharply, reinforcing the evident truth that the private sector cannot meet the demand for affordable housing. Due to a deliberate Government decision, council rents have risen by an average of 12Â·3 per cent., although that average conceals much more extreme rises such as the successive rises imposed in Ealing. It must also be remembered that it was the unfairness of the burden placed by Government policy on the housing revenue account and, therefore, on the tenants and their rents which led the Tory councillors in West Oxfordshire to resign last year. The unfair pressure requiring some tenants to pay for the subsidies payable to others continues. Housing associations have also had to respond to high interest rates by raising rents. In 1990, new lets were at an average rent per week for a three-bedroomed house of between Â£46 and Â£54, beyond the reach of most low-income families. That was the conclusion of the joint report by the House-Builders Federation and the Association of District Councils entitled "" Bridging the Affordability Gap in 1990"". The report found that fewer than half all young people under the age of 30 could afford to buy their own homes and it called, not surprisingly and with our support, for 100,000 houses to be built each year for rent or shared ownership. With the supply of housing drying up and the costs of housing rising sharply, it is little wonder that homelessness is increasing rapidly. No fewer than 145,790 households, or almost 400,000 people, have been accepted as homeless in the past year-a doubling of the number with which the Tory Government began the decade. Some 12,170 homeless households are in bed-and-breakfast accommodation at an average cost of Â£15,440 per annum. That figure was described in May by the Public Accounts Committee as "" bad value for money"". The average cost per year of building those families a new home would be just half the cost of bed-and-breakfast accommodation at Â£8,200.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,5,housing,773

The facts are depressing and damning and they cannot be gainsaid. The Government's excuse is that demand for housing has risen as the baby boom of the 1960s has taken effect and as a higher divorce rate has split families. That makes the failure to prevent the fall in supply even more culpable. The facts are the record of a decade of failure of a Government who had the huge benefit of riches from the North sea, but who have ended the decade with the shameful spectacle of young people begging on our streets by day and sleeping on our streets by night. The facts are the record of a Government who proclaimed an economic miracle, but who failed to provide the most basic of human needs-a roof over one's head-for many of their citizens. The facts are the record of a Government who have provided great benefits to some via tax cuts, capital gains and salary increases-including those that we shall debate later today-but who have left hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of the most vulnerable people in our society in overcrowded slums or without homes at all. The facts are potent, but they conceal more than they tell. The official statistics measure only the statutory definition of homelessness; they do not tell the full story. They certainly do not tell the story of the individual tragedies which are now occurring on a huge scale. Surely Conservative Members cannot be unaware of the tragedies, such as the young families divided, the young mothers driven to despair and mental illness and the fathers who have lost their families and therefore their homes, and who end up, as in the case of one of my constituents, sleeping in a car for two years.

That assertion is hardly controversial any longer, as even Ministers now concede, in their more honest moments, that a huge consumer boom was unwisely unleashed on the basis of a surge in private sector credit which inflated property values and thereby created a new, though unstable, basis on which to construct a further edifice of credit. That tottering structure inevitably collapsed and the penal interest rates which were then put in place destroyed the private property market on which the Government had pinned all their hopes. Those who live by the market die by the market. Today's property market has killed not only the hopes of millions of families, but the illusions of the Government.

I imagine that no one was more shocked than he by the insensitive statement he was reported as making. The nature of insensitive remarks is their power to cast a spotlight on the dark places of Ministers' minds and of Government policy. The spotlight recorded a contempt for the homeless and a total lack of understanding of their plight and the Government's contribution to it. The Government's attitude has led to a wholly irrational antipathy to public sector provision, with local authorities forbidden to spend their own money on housing and deliberately squeezed out by Government policy from any responsibility of meeting housing need. Ministers have learnt nothing from a decade of failure in that respect. Even those such as the Minister who have a reputation for more liberal views have been content to reinforce the ludicrous injunction against local authorities using their land, their money and their political will to meet a desperately required housing need. We have an ideologue in action. At the conference of the Institute of Housing only last week, the Minister was at it yet again, telling local authorities that they were not to provide new housing and that they would have to put housing contracts out to compulsory competitive tender. That heavy burden of ideology, which has so prejudiced our housing programme, brings me to the Secretary of State-or at least it would if he were present. The right hon. Gentleman is becoming the invisible man of the Department of the Environment-the ghost at the feast, or, in the case of housing, the ghost of famine. The right hon. Gentleman seems curiously reluctant to come to the Dispatch Box to defend what his Department is doing.

Why is the right hon. Gentleman so shy and so unwilling to face the music? On housing, the reason is not hard to find. He is, after all, a man with a record-a man with previous form.

It is a question not just of money but of things that do not cost money, such as the availability of land. That is why we propose, for example, a new use class for land for social and affordable housing. Secondly, we should forget the ridiculous dividing line between public and private-sector providers. Those who need decent accommodation at affordable rents simply do not care whether the providers are politically correct in the view of the Secretary of State or anyone else. What they need are homes. Surely all the evidence shows that if we are to meet that need the public sector must be involved. It simply does not make sense to exclude its resources, expertise and political will.

I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's housing strategy. I believe that our broad-based approach is right. We are maximising investment from all sources, not just the public sector. We are developing new forms of tenure, such as rent-to-mortgage and shared ownership, and new forms of social landlord, such as the housing action trusts. We are introducing new partnerships with the housing associations, and a new regime for private landlords. That approach is the right one. We want to work with the grain of people's aspirations and with the grain of market forces. The Government's approach is more likely to succeed than is the more narrowly based approach advocated by the Labour party, which leans more heavily on local authorities and public finance which might not be available. As we have just heard, that approach turns its back on some of the more radical conclusions that we are developing and would lose the possibility of contributions from institutional finance.

Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who, as I understand it, has just given a commitment to enter a crash programme for building 50,000 extra homes, whether he has the authority of the shadow Chief Secretary in making that commitment.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,36,housing,303

Not only can the Government's approach promote better housing, it can help bring down some of the barriers in our society and eliminate some of the fault lines that demarcate too many of our inner-city areas. We all know of estates designed by people who do not have to live in them and occupied by people who do not want to live in them. We want to turn those estates round, with the help of the residents and of private funds. We want the yeast of home ownership to raise the standards on those estates and transform the lives of those who live there. I should like to say a word in a moment about housing action trusts, whose potential the Labour party discounts. The guilty men are not those accused in the hon. Gentleman's speech. They are local councils, such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Norris), that leave properties unlet while families wait in bed and breakfast, that leave rents uncollected and plead shortage of money for maintenance. In London, the 10 least efficient local authorities had not collected Â£135 million in rent by the end of March 1990, and on 1 April 1991 owned 21,200 empty properties. That compares with 12,000 families in bed and breakfast at the same time. None of those authorities was controlled by my party. All but one were controlled by the Labour party. Profligacy and inefficiency are the hallmark of Labour in government. It is no response for Labour Members to refer to properties owned by the Ministry of Defence.

Before I tackle the problems raised by the hon. Member for Dagenham, let me put them in focus. The total housing stock has increased by nearly 2 million since we came to office. The population has risen less fast, so there are now more homes per thousand of the population than when we started. In 1979 there were 377 dwellings per thousand of the population whereas in 1990 there were 406 dwellings per thousand. Professor Duncan Mac Lennan, in a report entitled "" Affordable Housing in Europe"" published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: "" By international standards, Britain is well-housed. It has a well-developed and efficient set of private housing finance institutions and a complex, expensive set of government subsidy measures"". Professor Mac Lennan outlines areas of concern to which I shall return, such as homelessness, affordability and the private rented sector, but he finished with the following warning: "" one of the major realisations of the British Housing sector in the last two decades has been that a massive, monopolistic social housing provision can move rapidly from 'solution' to `problem'."" I mentioned housing action trusts, which I believe are a solution that we can offer to estates such as those to which I referred. There is a growing gulf between the dogma of the Front-Bench Labour party spokesmen and the more realistic approach adopted by Labour councils in touch with reality. The Labour party is officially against housing action trusts. The housing spokesman is on the record as saying that he would wind up the Hull HAT and return it to the city council. That is an extraordinary commitment. The tenants have just voted two to one to leave Hull council control and to go to a housing action trust. The Labour party is for ever asking for local ballots on Government initiatives. It now proposes to overrule them when the results do not conform to its prejudices. Nor is it just Hull that backs our proposals for a HAT. The leadership in Liverpool-a regime which apparently has the full backing of the Labour party-is now actively investigating the feasibility of a HAT for its tower blocks. Other Labour-controlled local authorities are also recognising that a housing action trust may be the right solution for some of their estates.

They may prefer to choose a housing association to manage their homes or they may want to manage their homes themselves through an estate management board. The point is that, at the end of the day, the decision will rest with the tenants. Estate action is another policy that is relevant to those who live on difficult estates. Some 600 schemes up and down the country have been implemented, renovating 300,000 units, improving management, diversifying tenure, providing training opportunities and making the estates places where people want to live.

One strand of our efforts to improve the quality of life on run-down estates is an initiative, under the auspices of Professor Coleman, in which the impact of the physical redesign of such estates is tested. I am pleased to announce today the seventh scheme to be included in the experiment, which is on the Durham estate in Sandwell. Some Â£2Â·9 million of Government resources are being devoted to the scheme which will ensure the transformation of 261 homes. The hon. Member for Dagenham did not touch on the policy of large-scale voluntary transfer. That policy is releasing resources tied up in council housing, part of which can then be reinvested. Sixteen local authorities, none of them Labour, have balloted their tenants and subsequently transferred their stock to a housing association. That has brought in more than Â£1 billion of entirely private-sector finance. It has enabled repairs to be carried out more quickly than if the stock had remained in council ownership. Independent research into the results of the first transfers has revealed a high level of satisfaction with the new landlord and greater tenant participation in management. In the two years since the first transfer, the New Chiltern housing association has succeeded in reducing both rent arrears and the volume of empty dwellings. At the same time, part of the capital receipt has been used to finance a substantial new-build programme carried out by the association. That shows how local authorities, tenants, housing associations and private investors can come together to fund better homes and more homes without increasing public expenditure. It is an approach that Labour, with its slavish adherence to the drab policy of municipalisation, has so far rejected.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,56,housing,319

1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],272,George Young,Con,False,"My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The key point about resourcing housing associations, as opposed to local authorities, is that housing associations can go to the City. They can top up the resources that the Government make available to provide more units. A local authority cannot do that. The direction of funds in that way not only helps the housing association movement; it ensures that there are more houses for people who need them. I should like to press the Labour party on the question of capital receipts. Labour housing spokesmen seem to think that they can increase spending on housing, without incurring the displeasure of the shadow Chief Secretary, by spending capital receipts. That will not do. Capital receipts are used to reduce the level of debt. Under the new regime, we have allocated part of the spending power from those areas with receipts to those without receipts. If capital receipts are to be spent again, the money will have to be borrowed-as is the case with any spending commitment not covered by higher taxes-with the usual impact on interest rates and the PSBR. The key question in the debate on housing is not the rather narrow one that the hon. Member for Dagenham asked: how many rented houses can the local councils build? The debate should be much broader than that. We should ask ourselves how we can maximise total investment in housing of all tenures. The question does not revolve around public investment alone. As I have said, the housing associations are increasingly borrowing from the City to complement what we allocate. That does not score as public expenditure. Private builders are building low-cost homes on land owned by councils or on land secured by the exceptions policy. Home ownership is the ambition of most people, and we have enabled 1Â·5 million former local authority tenants to buy their homes. Our recent research has shown that 96 per cent. of them felt that, taking everything into account, they were pleased to have bought. Few of those people would have achieved that ambition if the Labour party had had its way. Of those who bought between 1985 and 1987, 90 per cent. carried out significant repairs and improvements. Not only has the policy helped those who bought; it has helped those who have not. The local authorities have been relieved of the burden of maintaining and managing these homes, and the amount spent on capital renovation and on management and maintenance of the remaining stock has increased. Spending on capital renovation increased from Â£150 per dwelling in 1980-81 to Â£450 this year-a real increase of more than 50 per cent. Spending on management and maintenance increased from less than Â£300 per dwelling to Â£800 per dwelling-a real increase of 40 per cent. There is scope for promoting home ownership yet further, perhaps by building more properties for shared ownership-for those who can afford a council rent but cannot afford the full costs of home ownership.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,60,housing,497

On home ownership, will the Minister consider a problem that is occurring in my area? I refer to the people who bought council houses but who can no longer afford them. Those people have found that they cannot get out and that there is nowhere for them to go. They have to rely on the local authority, which no longer has any houses for rent.

1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],275,George Young,Con,False,"That brings me straight on to the problem of repossessions, which has already been referred to. It is untrue to claim that the Government are doing nothing to help those who face difficulties with their mortgage. In 1989-90, Â£350 million was paid in income support to help people who were eligible to pay their mortgage. There has been some comment, in the light of one case, that the system is too generous, rather than too tight. Nor do I accept the gloomy forecasts that are made of future repossessions. Over the past three years, people have had difficulty maintaining payments, as interest rates rose faster than their incomes. This put pressure on their budgets, leading in some cases to greater arrears. But, with base rates falling 3Â·5 per cent. in less than a year, and incomes for those in work rising by 4Â·5 per cent., that source of pressure is clearly reducing. Those who coped during the period of rising interest rates should be able to cope as they fall. I would, therefore, hope to see fewer repossessions because of that imbalance. The pressure in future may come from rising unemployment, but it is important to understand that redundancy or long-term illness no longer means the loss of a home. If there is an entitlement to income support, that will pay half the reasonable mortgage interest for the first 16 weeks and all the interest thereafter, including any interest on any arrears that have accrued during the 16 weeks. So if someone loses his or her job, claims income support, contacts his or her building society to put it in the picture, and then pays over the income support to the building society, the building society would be most unlikely to contemplate possession proceedings. So although I am, of course, concerned at the information coming through-there are many repossessions in the pipeline-the changing circumstances to which I have referred may mean that some forecasts are too gloomy. Other options are available to minimise the trauma of repossession. I understand that, through a housing association, Mole Valley council is offering shared ownership to owner-occupiers who cannot afford the full cost, leaving them in their homes as part-owners, part-renters. The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. McKay) may find that point relevant. Some building societies may be willing to allow owners to rent out their homes for a while or to roll up some interest until things improve. Surprisingly, only a minority of mortgage payers with repayments set annually have taken advantage of the chance to have their repayments reviewed to reflect the recent cuts in mortgage rates. I had intended to say something about the private rented sector and our plans for it but, out of respect to the many hon. Members who wish to speak, I shall skip that and turn finally to rough sleeping. In the past six months, we have witnessed in our capital city the most concerted and best resourced attempt ever to help rough sleepers. The front-line agencies, whose work I applaud, have in the first six months reduced by about half the number of people sleeping rough in central London. The programme of investing Â£96 million in direct access hostels and move-on accommodation is only one third of the way through-with about 1,000 of the planned 3,300 places available. The Bull-Ring, by Waterloo station, known as "" cardboard city"", is closed, with all of those who were sleeping there being offered alternative accommodation- although some have refused it. I recognise that we have some way to go. I am concerned about the numbers of people in Lincolns Inn Fields, but we have plans for more hostels nearby which should be open this autumn. I also welcome the help from the Department of Health, which is providing high-care hostels and outreach teams with medical skills to help those rough sleepers who suffer from mental illness and drug and alcohol problems. I am determined that the momentum we have built should be maintained and the policy seen through. I have recently spoken critically not of rough sleepers but of professional, aggressive beggars, who prey on passers-by, tourists in the west end and young homeless people, who, when arrested, turn out to have fixed addresses and substantial sums of money on them. That group would like us to confuse them with young vulnerable people with no homes. We must make sure that we do not. In conclusion, our policy is based not on a massive municipal expansion programme, but on diversity of provision, on encouraging the public sector to work closely with the private sector, on bringing in fresh funds to deal with the worst of the problems, and on offering choice and diversity to as many people as possible. Old prejudices and preconceptions must be overturned. The best local authorities are already working with housing associations, using their urban renewal powers and their planning powers, working up proposals for city challenge, estate action, priority estates projects, housing action trusts, large-scale voluntary transfer, and promoting rural trusts in our smaller villages. I ask the House to endorse that approach by voting for the amendment.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,63,housing,858

1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],277,Keith Bradley,Lab,False,"Thank you for calling me so early in the debate, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is an outrage that the Government should have sought to make a statement today, thus leaving less than an hour for Back-Bench Members to speak on this important topic. However, I shall be brief, as you have requested, Madam Deputy Speaker, because many of my hon. Friends wish to speak in this important debate. The motion encapsulates the Government's abject failure throughout the 12 years of their administration to provide a coherent and meaningful policy that would give everyone in this country the right to a decent home. Listening to the Minister's speech was like hearing an echo from the past. He simply rehearsed all the arguments that were advanced by one of his predecessors during the Second Reading of the Housing Act 1988. The Minister rehashed those earlier policies although any objective analysis and the panic measures that the Government have recently undertaken on homelessness prove that the Government have no real understanding of people's need and right to live in a decent home. In that Second Reading debate in 1987, the Government outlined what they viewed as their flagship policies for housing in the 1990s. The Government were proud of their Bill and its main initiatives, some of which the Minister referred to, such as the housing action trusts, the ability of local tenants to opt out of local authority control of housing, the market rent system and the introduction of assured tenancies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has already said, ably led by our spokesman on housing, the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley), the Opposition Members who served on the Standing Committee that considered the Bill made it clear then that the Government's policies had no relevance to people's needs and that they would not work. If we look at the way in which those policies have affected my city of Manchester during the past four years, we can see that we were right to oppose them and that we are right to say today that they still do not have any relevance to or meet the housing needs of cities such as Manchester. First, how many housing action trusts have been welcomed and introduced throughout the country? Very few. One of the first to be suggested in the first tranche of housing action trusts for Manchester was rejected out of hand by the people of Manchester. Secondly, how many council tenants in Manchester have requested a ballot because they want to leave local authority control, and how many ballots have taken place? There has been not one ballot and not a single request for one because the people of Manchester know that their landlord-the council-is trying to deliver a service and that the only reason that it cannot is that it has been starved of resources. Thirdly, in the Government's terms, have market rents in the private rented sector delivered a massive expansion in the number of homes that people can afford? Again, the answer is no because, although there has been an increase in the private rented sector in Manchester, it has been only in the luxury private rented sector where rents are at levels that most people cannot afford. People can afford such rents only if they are rich or if the private landlord has ripped off the housing benefit system and tried to increase the rent at the expense of public subsidy. I welcome and applaud Manchester city council's initiative to drive out such landlords by saying, "" We are not prepared to sanction the rent levels that those landlords are trying to charge on the back of housing benefit."" The Government should condemn that practice also because that is not the way to create affordable rents in the private rented sector. The Minister wants us to consider public expenditure on housing in conjunction with allocations made to housing associations. More important, we must examine bids for resources made by councils such as Manchester for their housing investment programmes, because they clearly identify, both in the public and private sectors, the money that is needed to provide decent houses in their areas. An examination of the bid compared with the allocation finally granted shows that the Government have had no commitment to the provision of resources for decent housing in our cities. In Manchester, for example, Â£189 million was sought in 1988-89 and Â£29 million was allocated. In 1989-90, Â£210 million was sought and Manchester received only Â£19 million. There was an increase in 1990-91, because Â£100 million was sought and Â£52 million received. Even so, in that year, Manchester received only half of what it really needed to deal with its housing stock. In the current year, from a bid of Â£127 million, the city received Â£61 million. It is clear from the figures that the council has not been able to improve, modernise, install heating and so on for the houses that are required by Manchester families. The result is that we have a record number of homeless, with over 7,000 people in the city seeking their first decent home. We must examine the implications of that situation on the private sector and renovation grants. In the last year, the city of Manchester received an allocation from the Exchequer of Â£3Â·405 million, a 75 per cent. allocation, to enable the private sector to renovate its stock. Out of that sum must be funded disablement grants, to enable people with disabilities to adapt their homes, and so on. So in the last year, 1,250 applicants wanting about Â£8 million have had to get what they can from the paltry allocation of Â£3 million or a little over. With the rundown in the public and private sectors of housing, we are storing up problems for future generations. As our private stock of housing falls into disrepair, the people of the future will not have their housing needs met. We have heard enough about the rundown in the house building programme to know that in the future there will be greater demands on the public sector to house people, but homes will not be available for them. I have some suggestions for the way in which we, including the Labour party, should be examining the housing issue for the future. We can have a coherent housing policy only if we tackle root and branch the problem of housing finance and the ways in which, in the future, we fund the public and private sectors. I welcome the report published last week by the Rowntree trust, chaired by the Duke of Edinburgh, which advocated such a root and branch review of housing finance. Until we equalise subsidies between the different sectors, and conduct a thorough examination of mortgage tax relief and the amount available through subsidy and benefits to the private rented sector, we shall not free the resources necessary to expand the different tenures in the housing market. That report rekindled a debate that has been going on for many years. I made a modest contribution to that debate over 12 years ago in a research project at York university with Professor Jonathon Bradshaw, in which we advocated the development of a universal housing allowance. In an article in Roof magazine entitled "" Can a housing allowance work?"" we examined the first stage of such an allowance, which was the integration of what was then supplementary benefit housing payments with rent rebates. We moved from there to look at the possibility of integrating all subsidies, whether in the owner-occupied sector through mortgage tax relief or through the public or private rented sectors, to see whether we could contribute modestly to a debate allowing for the easier transfer of people between and within tenures. We accept-I hope that the Labour party will examine this seriously; I appreciate that it could not be done overnight-that the phasing out of mortgage tax relief, if it became policy, would take many years. That was said by the Duke of Edinburgh's study. But unless we start heading in that direction, with a massive explosion in subsidy, Â£9 billion will be spent in the next couple of years on mortgage tax relief. That money would be better spent on providing decent housing. We must have a subsidy arrangement providing a housing allowance that can be cashed in to enable people to move into any form of tenure, at any stage, in the owner-occupied or rented sectors. Such a step would achieve greater mobility because people would not be locked into mortgages in areas from which they cannot move because of fluctuating house prices. Such a housing allowance would free the market and give people the opportunity to move and have different tenures at different times of their lives. They would do that when it suited them, instead of being financially penalised by having locked themselves into mortgages at an early stage. Bearing in mind the proposals of the Rowntree trust, I hope that the Government will take action along the lines that have been recommended. I feel sure that the Labour party will take the matter seriously, for unless we have a root and branch study of housing finance in Britain, and find ways to free resources to ensure the right of everyone to a decent home, we shall never make progress. We will tackle the problem of homelessness not by initiatives that resemble panic measures and not by examining incoherent policies, the long-term implications of which cannot be foreseen, but by accepting that a thorough examination of housing finance is the key to housing in the future. The next Labour Government will take the issue seriously because my hon. Friends and I appreciate, as the motion says, that the mark of a civilised society is the provision of decent homes for its people. If we do not put housing high on the political agenda, future generations will not forgive us. The citizens of Manchester understand that, and because they put housing high on the agenda, they will vote accordingly at the next general election.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,65,housing,1686
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],278,Douglas French,Con,False,"I am grateful for having been called early in this short debate and I wish at the outset to congratulate the Minister on the knowledgeable and constructive way in which he dealt with the subject. He is increasingly recognised among housing practitioners as a person who appreciates the difficulties that they are endeavouring to overcome, and I congratulate him on his efforts so far. I cannot say the same about the speech of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who wove a tale of gloom and woe. I listened in vain to that part of his speech in which I thought he might produce some constructive proposals, but what little his remarks contained was unspecific and he did not answer any questions. The hon. Gentleman said that his party and others should forget the ridiculous dividing line between public and private providers. I shall concentrate on that initially, particularly the question of voluntary transfers, to which the Minister referred. Regrettably, there has been no significant example of a voluntary transfer to a pre-existing independent housing association. Twenty nine specially formed housing associations have been created for specific local authority areas, of which 16 have been successful at ballot while 13 have been unsuccessful. About 70,000 houses have been transferred so far. While I do not belittle that achievement, it is a smaller number than had been hoped for, and certainly fewer than the merits of such transfers justify. Where there has been a willing local authority and a willing housing association, often the stumbling block has been the way in which the campaign preceding a ballot has been undertaken. There are a number of examples of how entrenched interests against a transfer taking place have been ill-informed. Arguments have often been presented to tenants in a highly distorted way and tenants have been led to believe that penalties would ensue should they support a voluntary transfer. Believing in the argument that better the devil they know than the devil they do not know, tenants have accordingly voted against the proposed transfer.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,66,housing,342

Friend agree that local authorities such as Kirklees, which is my authority, have taken an ideological view on that matter and, over the past four years, have lost about Â£12 million in housing development money because of their silly socialist principles?",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,67,housing,44
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],280,Douglas French,Con,False,"I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Her council is one of many where opportunities to bring more resources into the sector have been missed or rejected for ideological reasons. My constituency of Gloucester has had a similar experience. The arguments deployed against transferring to an independent housing association were grossly distorted and ill-informed. One of the difficulties is that the prospective housing association is obliged to put forward a firm proposal, with reliable figures for the projection of future rents and an explanation of how the financial package will hold together. But those who wish to oppose the proposal can refute those figures without, in turn, having to demonstrate that what they say is correct. Although they may have criticised the prospect of increased rents and argued that the local authority could secure lower rent levels over a particular period, in the event it may not prove to be the case. However, by the time that becomes evident the arguments against voluntary transfer have prevailed. The voluntary transfer to a local housing association -one that emerges from a local authority-is akin to a management buyout. It suits some people but does not necessarily suit everyone. However, those who are unwilling to go down that route seem to me to have another option. Self-governing trusts have been introduced in respect of hospitals and the equivalent in education is grant-maintained status. By the same token there is a sound argument for local authority housing departments becoming charitable trusts. Those who are persuaded towards trust status, whether they are in schools or hospitals, are attracted to the opportunity to provide better internal management, a more productive use of resources and a better capacity to deliver the service to consumers. Those who run the services have a better opportunity to find the right solutions to solve the problems facing them. That principle can easily be adapted to local authority housing departments. A charitable trust emerging from a local authority housing department would be the recipient of the local authority department's assets and liabilities, but the authority would continue to act as banker and would retain the debt profile serviced by the trust and secured on the properties. Like other trusts, the trust could appoint outsiders to manage it and inject private sector expertise into its operations. I do not claim to be the originator of that idea. Some housing practitioners have already put it forward and explained it far more eloquently than I have. However, I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the principle carefully because it has great merits. Other examples of ingenious housing initiatives can be drawn from international experience. One such example is rather confusingly known as the correlation insurance indemnity. Anyone who mentions the word "" insurance"" in a housing debate is quickly shouted down, but I refer to the experience in New South Wales- The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) laughs. It so happens that the housing profile in New South Wales is remarkably similar to the housing profile in a number of areas in this country. The housing department there has made an especially useful arrangement through the National Bank of Australia. Without going into the details of the system, which is complex, it boils down to a cost efficient way to obtain private finance to build substantially more houses than would otherwise be built through conventional methods. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider that example as it could be adapted to the United Kingdom's experience. One of the difficulties has been to persuade financial institutions that housing associations are appropriate organisations in which to place funds. That was well illustrated three years ago, when North housing association endeavoured to raise money in the City. At that time, it said that the biggest two difficulties were the two words in its name-"" north"" and "" housing""-which put off many institutions that might otherwise have been persuaded to lend money. It overcame that difficulty and convinced the financial institutions that it was a viable haven for their funds. However, housing associations have often failed to present their case effectively to financial institutions. Housing associations executives have often failed to distinguish between what the financial institutions seek in terms of equity and where they would place fixed interest loans. One is suitable for risk and the other clearly is not. The packages put together by housing associations have not always recognised that. There is also an urgent need for housing associations to rethink how they present their accounts. Some hon. Members will know that they have a curious way of presenting them. It is largely misunderstood, or not understood at all, in the City and it puts many City institutions off. A little effort to reconsider the presentation of those accounts would go a long way. A viable rented sector needs willing landlords for whom renting is worth while, tenants who can afford to pay the rents, an arithmetic that stacks up, and a political framework with some continuity. Those are obvious requirements, but there are obstacles preventing their achievement. I refer in particular to housing benefit. The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) said that landlords-I am not sure whether he referred to "" wicked"" landlords but has perhaps done so on other occasions-were "" ripping off"" the housing benefit system. I do not believe that the blame rests exclusively with landlords. The housing benefit system does not operate as well as it might for two reasons. First, landlords and tenants cannot generally risk signing a contract until housing benefit is confirmed. Conversely, housing benefit officials often will not confirm the availability of housing benefit until the landlord and tenant have signed a contract. That is a Catch-22 situation which it should be possible to sort out. Again, I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider that problem. My second point relates to the attitude adopted by the hon. Member for Withington. Sometimes landlords provide accommodation for people in receipt of housing benefit only to discover part way through the tenancy that the eligibility for housing benefit has ceased. The landlord has no means of knowing that until he is asked by the housing benefit office to refund some of the money paid on behalf of the tenant who is no longer eligible. That is a quick and sure way of discouraging landlords from offering accommodation to recipients of housing benefit. The procedure needs tightening up; if it is not improved people will fail to find accommodation that they need. Finally, I urge the Minister to take another look at circular 7/91 published on 10 May, in which he announed his intention to allow public subsidy to go into shared ownership schemes even when there is some restriction on the availability of staircasing. Before the circular was issued the right to full staircasing was a strict requirement but the circular modified that requirement. The message coming from the Housing Corporation seems to contradict the contents of the circular-a matter of particular concern to people in rural areas. I urge my hon. Friend to tidy up this incompatibility.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,68,housing,1187
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],281,Ronnie Fearn,LibDem,False,"I believe that everyone should have the right to a decent and affordable home. It is a national disgrace that in 1991 thousands of people are sleeping on our streets, hundreds of thousands are registered as homeless and countless more are living in cramped and unhealthy accommodation. I accept that far more people now own their homes, but I cannot accept the cost at which that has been achieved. Government ideology, Government policy and the legislative changes of the past decade are major contributory factors to the appalling state of the nation's housing stock. Britain's housing is in crisis. The immediate response should be the removal of restrictions on local government finance to allow the greater use of capital receipts for new build, maintenance and improvement. But that is not the whole answer, since many local authorities do not have large capital receipts or stocks of housing to sell. I should like some of the Â£23 billion that the Treasury has pocketed from the sale of council houses in the past 10 years to be reinvested in the housing market. Any Administration under our control would want substantially to increase direct public support for housing for people, however low their incomes. Our aim is to allow people maximum choice in how they house themselves and to gain maximum value for every pound of public money that we spend. This can be achieved by stimulating new investment to meet housing needs, by increasing the total amount of subsidy available and by dispensing it in a way that matches resources more closely to needs. We need to increase the money available for housing associations and local authorities to build, acquire, improve and maintain housing so as to provide for people on low incomes. We should introduce partnership housing, using a new and limited form of subsidy to enable a serious gap in the housing market to be filled-housing for people on middle incomes who for one reason or another prefer renting to buying. Measures such as these would need a new form of support, which we suggest would come from a housing cost relief, which will have the effect of making high rents more affordable and of enabling more people to cope with the difficult early years of buying a home. We hear a great deal about affordable housing, but what does it mean? What is affordable rented housing? There can be no precise definition of an affordable rent; each household has different incomes, needs, priorities and skills for coping with its budget. At the moment the country relies on housing benefit to implement affordable rents, but the steep withdrawal of that benefit with increasing income has a damaging effect on incentives for people on low incomes to increase their earnings. Ideally we should like a tax and social security system that shifts so much of the burden away from the low-paid that they can without hardship make a bigger contribution to their housing costs-",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,69,housing,493
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],282,Ronnie Fearn,LibDem,False,"I have no time to give way. We recognise that there would still be a need for a closely targeted housing benefit system, but we think that targeting could be less severe than it is now. Even a modest rate of withdrawal, at between 65p and 55p in the pound, should make life easier for many people. The pressures of the past 12 years have been in the direction of home ownership and the right to buy, but many people on average incomes would prefer to rent if rented accommodation were available and affordable. With the housing market in its present condition I understand that there is a discernible move away from buying and into renting. We see our proposals for housing cost relief and partnership housing as the only reasonable and economic way forward to encourage new housing for rent. Housing cost relief would differ from housing benefit in three ways. It would apply to rent and mortgage payments above a certain level, say, Â£30 a week, and up to a ceiling of, say, Â£100 a week, with regional variations. It would cover only a proportion, perhaps 50 per cent., of the rent or the mortgage interest. The rate of withdrawal with increases in income would be gentle-probably about 20p in the pound. The threshold above which relief would be withdrawn would stand at about the median level of net income for a single earner: at the moment, about Â£150 a week. The introduction of such a housing cost relief would make possible the introduction of a new rented housing sector based on a lower subsidy than that applied to the provision of housing for low-income households. We call this new sector partnership housing. It would be based on a capital subsidy that would depend on market conditions of house prices relative to income. The level of subsidy would fall as land and house prices fell relative to income. The rent on a home costing Â£75,000 would be about Â£80 a week. Housing cost relief would reduce the cost to the tenant by up to Â£25 to a minimum of Â£55 a week. By this method we think that as many as 50 per cent. more dwellings could be provided through a partnership housing scheme, for a given amount of public spending.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,70,housing,383

1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],284,Ronnie Fearn,LibDem,False,"I have not given way so far, and I will not now. Thus far I have spoken only about homes for rent, but if we are true to our aims of maximising choice the option to buy a home must extend down the income scale. The right-to-buy policy has made that possible for some, but it applies only to people living in council housing and we are well aware that the supply of stock is dwindling. Housing cost relief will give people on modest incomes about twice as much help as they would receive from mortgage tax relief, which is a less effective way of helping people. Indeed, I believe that many of the parties in the House are thinking again about it. The ceiling of Â£30,000 is half the cost of an average home and because of its across-the-board nature it does not target public money where it is most needed. Another scheme with the potential to help people on modest incomes to buy their homes is shared ownership. We welcome the arrangements for that brought in by the Government-they are not dissimilar to our partnership housing proposals. Our system of housing cost relief will offer a great deal of help and make shared ownership possible for a wider range of people. The provision of housing will mean little if that housing is of poor quality or if it is not maintained adequately. Investment in maintenance and repair is essential, and it makes economic and social sense to ensure that there are enough funds to maintain the existing stock. To allow property to fall into disrepair and rack and ruin merely adds to the housing and homeless crises. The erosion of local authority responsibility for building control must have a detrimental effect and has caused hardship to many home buyers. Full responsibility for the inspection and approval of building works should be restored to local authorities. There must be a review of all aspects of building regulations and codes of practice with a view to improving the long-term durability of construction and economy in the use of energy. We would promote the standards that are recommended in "" Homes for the Future"", which was published jointly by the Institute of Housing and the Royal Institute of British Architects, and would consider legislative backing for the essential standards in that document. I favour legislation to widen the definition of unfitness. That is relevant to the private rented sector in which conditions are often appalling. People who rent in the private sector are entitled to decent, good-quality accommodation. In 1989, we said that we would encourage local authorities to take the initiative in developing agency schemes to help improve and maintain privately owned housing stock. We have been pleased with developments since then at national and local level, although we share doubts as to whether the Â£3 million allocated by the Government is enough to keep those agencies going. While we welcome the funds allocated to inner-city projects for improving estates, we would like to see all councils being able to improve the quality of life on their estates and, where necessary, being able to redevelop. Another issue requiring attention is the number of empty properties under local government control. When waiting lists are long, that should not be tolerated. Many of the properties are empty because councils do not have the money to bring them up to standard. Others are empty because of mismanagement and inefficiency. Councils must find ways to turn over property between lettings at a much quicker rate. One way may be to involve the tenants, and I was pleased to hear the Minister speak about that. Tenants could carry out redecorating and minor repair work. More funds should be provided to enable local authorities to bring empty properties back on to the rent market, and a relaxation of capital controls could provide some such funds. We advocate a regular analysis of repairs that are required and those that have been carried out, and we want to see regular monitoring of performance with contractors expected to reach high standards of tenant satisfaction. For example, the Liberal Democrat-controlled council of Berwick has a four-year rolling programme for repairs using a number of small agencies. The condition of the council's stock and the efficiency of its programme was recently given an excellent report by the Audit Commission. Our councils are committed to tackling the deterioration in the private sector by running an efficient improvement grant system and by working with agencies and the voluntary sector to ensure that those in most need are getting the assistance that they require. The Government's improvement grant means test is far too restrictive, and we should like to see it removed for the disabled and the elderly. The elderly are particularly relevant because they disproportionately have homes which lack basic amenities and they cannot afford repair and maintenance. There is an obvious need for more direct investment of public money in the grants system. That would be imperative if the definition of unfitness were broadened and standards were strictly enforced. Enforcement is rather lax at the moment. However, when providing direct funding we must look at other ways of providing incentives to save and repair. Private sector tenants who do not have a repair obligation in their contracts are, of course, not entitled to an improvement grant, yet the private rented sector contains some of the worst disrepair. We should tackle that by giving tenants the right, with local authority approval for works and cost, to call in contractors to carry out essential repairs. In that context I am sure that there is a role for agencies. The local authority would be responsible for payment in the first place, but would be entitled to register a land charge against the property until the cost had been paid. When the repairs had been completed the landlord would be entitled to a rent increase, but that would be paid to the council until the debt was discharged. We expect that most tenants would have the extra rent increase largely covered by housing benefit. Local authorities should have a statutory duty to ensure that housing, public health and fire regulations are observed in all multiple occupation premises and that properties with three or more households sharing essential living accommodation should be registered with the local authority. Properties not up to standard should be priority targets for acquisition by councils, housing associations and co-operatives and, where appropriate, we would use compulsory purchase orders. I spoke about empty Government properties, but there are more than 600,000 empty properties in the private sector. Thousands of people are sleeping rough or in inadequate, cramped accommodation and it is obscene that so many properties are allowed to lie empty and fall into disrepair. We are willing to find ways of giving owners greater incentives to bring their properties up to standard and back on to the market, but when a property is intentionally left vacant we are prepared to introduce a new mechanism by which local authorities can serve a notice of intention to let, with appropriate right of appeal. Then, if necessary, we will extend compulsory purchase powers to enable local authorities to buy private homes which, I repeat, are intentionally left vacant for a significant time. I have outlined some of the policies that should have been put in place during the past 12 years. The disaster area of housing has gone on for far too long. It should be tackled now.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,72,housing,1253
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],285,Hugo Summerson,Con,False,"I shall concentrate on housing action trusts, not because I want to, but because of the short time that is available. There is a proposed housing action trust in the borough of Waltham Forest in my constituency, and it is greatly welcomed. If the tenants vote in favour of the trust, it will cost about Â£160 million to Â£170 million, which is a considerable investment of public money. The trust would cover four estates in the borough: Chingford hall, Boundary road, Oliver close and Cathall. Boundary road is in my constituency and all four estates share the same characteristics. They are 1960s designed and built tower blocks and they are horrendous. It is dreadful to think that they could ever have been conceived, and it is appalling that they were so badly built and have been disgracefully managed. Tower blocks breed unemployment, despair and misery, and the sooner that they are taken down the better. The only people who will regret their passing are the criminal fraternity, who engage in stripping stolen cars, and the owners of pit bull terriers. I do not know where those people will go when the blocks are demolished, but with any luck they will all make their way to Hammersmith. I am delighted to say that, if the housing action trust goes ahead, there will be tenants on the board, which will allow their voice to be heard. This is a great improvement over the housing action trust mark 1, which did not permit tenants any say in the running of their estates. Safeguards are built in for the tenants on, for example, rents, which will be frozen while the housing action trust is in operation. Once the tenants have moved to their new homes, the new rents will be set at levels similar to those for comparable council properties. Moreover, tenants will have the right to choose their own landlord. Once they have moved into their new homes, under the housing action trust, if tenants wish to keep the local authority as landlord, then they have the right to do so. If, on the other hand, they choose to have a housing association as their landlord, or if they choose to set up a tenants' co-operative so that they can run their homes themselves, or if they wish to exercise their right to buy, all these options are open to them. There is no question of privatising these estates-a slanderous and disgraceful suggestion that has been made by such bodies as the Socialist Workers party. I urge the tenants to take no notice of what these people say. There is no doubt but that this is the way forward. It is the way to deal with dreadful estates of this type. I hope that the tenants on such estates in the London borough of Waltham Forest will turn out in great numbers for the vote on 13 July. I hope that there will be a clear-cut, decisive vote.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,73,housing,495
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],286,Mildred Gordon,Lab,False,"The mark of a civilised society is that it is one in which people can expect to be decently housed and clothed, to have enough to eat and to have access to health care and to education for their children. Our society fails many people in a number of these respects, but nowhere more so than in housing. Every Member of Parliament representing an inner-city area has thousands of cases of human misery, ill health and broken families-all caused by overcrowding and the impossibility of getting somewhere decent to live. Furthermore, it is a cause of racial conflict. The Government put the squeeze on local authorities and refuse to let them have money for council house building, and so communities turn against each other and fight for the meagre resources that are left. The worst part of it is the loss of hope and the depression that come from 10 years of being on the waiting list and seeing no chance of a solution. Tower Hamlets is fairly typical of inner-city boroughs. It has over 1,000 families accepted as homeless. Many are in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. The money that goes on bed and breakfast represents millions of pounds down the drain because it provides no permanent solution. I have visited constituents in seedy bed-and-breakfast hotels in Paddington and Earl's Court. The conditions are appalling. In a room the size of a boxroom in an average semi-detached house, there are two beds, a mother and father and two children. There is no television or a fridge. There is a coffee table at which one person can eat while the others eat on their beds. The mother comes up a steep flight of stairs from a communal kitchen with one child in her arms and the other hanging off her skirts, carrying pots of boiling food. Not only are they in danger, but, as I know from my experience as a teacher, these children will have no chance of healthy development. A child needs a place to move, to run and to stretch so as to develop mentally and physically, and there is no room for them to do so. These families in bed-and-breakfast hotels are condemned to a nightmare. According to the community charge office, Tower Hamlets has 4,000 empty and second homes, most in the private sector. In docklands 1,500 units-the minimum admitted by the London Docklands development corporation-are luxury homes that people cannot afford to buy. We need radical solutions. The right-to-buy money must be released and used to repair empty homes so that they can be used. All unused land in public ownership must be released so that prefabs can be put on it; then we could do something within months to accommodate the vast majority of homeless families. Privately owned homes that have been empty for years must be requisitioned and let by local authorities. The right to buy helped many people to purchase their own homes, but it has reduced the condition of public sector housing stock. In London, one fifth of the housing stock has been sold, three quarters of it houses with gardens, because they are what everybody wants to live in. That leaves only 15 per cent. of council tenants in houses with gardens. Therefore, the worst stock is that left in municipal control. In docklands, we had a great opportunity to solve the housing problems because vast areas of land were left unused. When so much land is left empty, it must be zoned so that a fair proportion of it goes for affordable housing. Instead, million of square feet of office space was built, half of which is empty, and millions more are to come although they are surplus to requirements. That is not the answer that we need, in Tower Hamlets or any other city centre. Most people dream of owning their own homes, but for many that dream has turned sour and has become a nightmare in these days of unemployment and rising interest rates. People come to me in desperation. They have bought their homes, but they cannot pay service charges, or a big repair has to be carried out, and they do not have the money for it. Bow county court deals with more repossession cases than any other court in London. A single person needs an income of Â£21,000 and a family needs an income of Â£26,000 to be a first-time buyer. That is no answer in an area such as Tower Hamlets, one of the poorest in the country. The sad evidence of the failure of the Government's policy of trying to put an end to council house building can be seen all round us in London-in the people living in the streets, in the crowded rooms of the seedy bed-and-breakfast hotels and in the queues of desperate people in the surgeries of every London Member of Parliament. As I have said many times, for my constituents and those in other urban areas, the only practical answer is more affordable housing built by municipal authorities. The Government can shake their head and proffer other methods, but that method took people out of the slums and gave them decent homes and it is the only one that will work in the future.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,74,housing,875

I think probably the fundamental cause is, frankly, we've put the interests of the providers of the service, the workforce, above the interests of the tenants."" How true that is of so many services provided in Liverpool. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Minister was not able to develop his thoughts on reviving the private rented sector. My hon.

He pointed to some hopeful signs, but we still have a long way to go before we have a revived private rented sector. In contrast, in West Germany nearly half all homes are privately rented. In this country, there are some 600,000 empty private sector homes, many of which could be used to house the homeless. Unfortunately, previous restrictions have deterred such use. There are hopeful signs-for example, reports in the London borough of Islington published in October 1990 show that private landlords are renting up to 30 per cent. more homes than they were two years ago. But in my constituency and in other parts of the south-west, there is no substantial scope for reviving the private rented sector. We must look to local authorities, or more particularly housing associations, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary knows. I note that my hon. Friend the Minister said earlier that the Government have reallocated capital away from areas with receipts to areas without receipts. I hope that the Government will constantly take into account local authorities' practice of keeping homes empty, not collecting the rent and not facilitating the sale of council homes. Hon. Members will recall that I have made those points before. For example, in most of the districts of the south-west, between 25 and 30 per cent. of council accommodation has been sold, whereas in parts of London less than 10 per cent. of a much larger council estate has been sold. I hope that the Government will not lean over backwards too far to help inner cities in that respect. An unpublished study of the housing situation and the consequences of council sales in my constituency said: "" Family houses are more attractive to potential buyers than flats...This has clear implications for the housing section of Taunton Deane, as it displays a clear lack of available family accommodation which will either have to be met through an increased building programme, or through private rented sector property and reveals a problem which has arisen not solely, but perhaps largely as a result of the depletion of the housing stock through the promotion of the Right To Buy."" I therefore welcome the suggestion made in a letter dated 24 April from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State about the capital finance system. He said: "" We shall keep the workings of this system under review and I do not rule out changes at some time"". I reiterate that some flexibility in the administration of the system would be welcome not only to me but to a number of my hon. Friends who represent local authorities which have handled their assets well. Finally, I wish to relate housing provision and home improvements to our present economic situation and to the needs in the coming year or so to try to revive that sector of our economy. The Building Employers Confederation, in which I declare an interest as an adviser As the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) will recall, I advocated these views before I became involved with the organisation and I should continue to advocate them were I not involved. It makes this point: "" Housing output will have to be expanded in both the private and the public sectors, to meet market demand"". It also says: "" Capital receipts are an available source of funding for the Housing Corporation if Ministers do not wish local authorities to build. Now is a good time to get housing associations to increase output, because land and building prices are low and they can maximise 'bang for the buck'""-as builders call it-"" at present. Rules preventing local authorities using their own land to pay for more building work should be relaxed."" I note that when the economy was recovering from recession between 1981 and 1984 there was a significant increase in the amount of spending on home improvement grants. In the financial year 1981-82, Â£197 million was spent on home improvement grants. In 1983-84, when the economy was reviving, Â£911 million, nearly Â£1 billion, was spent on home improvement grants-a considerable increase at that time. I commend that to my hon. Friend the Minister. I know that he has recognised in correspondence with me the teething troubles in the system that was introduced last year and I hope that this opportunity will be taken to try to float that sector off the rocks on which it is at present. There is also the problem in my constituency, and I think in others, too, of owner-occupied homes which are in some difficulty because of non-traditional build. In Taunton-in the Galmington area-there are Woolaway houses which were built just after the war. They are not facing significant problems in terms of repair, but they are facing problems with regard to resale. As my constituent Mrs. Keitch says: "" On the last sale the purchaser had an extensive structural survey carried out on the house which proved positive in confirming that it was well-constructed and well maintained, but the purchaser withdrew because of unfounded rumours and worries about resale problems."" I have corresponded with my hon. Friend the Minister about that and I hope that he will continue to attach importance to the problem which is causing blight in parts of my constituency and no doubt other constituencies, too. Widows or elderly people occupying such homes and wanting to move to smaller, more manageable properties would release substantial three and four-bedroom houses for families in my constituency and elsewhere who are in urgent need of such accommodation. I commend my hon. Friend's policies and I commend these points of concern to his attention.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,75,housing,1095
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],288,Terry Rooney,Lab,False,"It is important when discussing housing to get away from the rhetoric of simply slagging off any Labour-controlled authority and blaming everything on municipalisation. We should remember that many Tory-controlled councils are public-sector landlords to many people. I also despair at Tory Members-one of whom I am glad to see returning to the Chamber, the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Mr. Howarth)-who spend their time here whingeing about their Labour-controlled authorities and then write to them asking for special treatment for people whom they see at their surgeries. That is despicable. It is important to remember that HIP allocations apply not simply to public sector schemes, but to new build, the modernisation of existing stock, the estate action programme allocation, statutory improvement grants, mortgages for council house buyers and support to housing associations. My authority in Bradford, which is a pleasant mix of inner-city and rural areas, has seen a 75 per cent. reduction during the past 10 years in its HIP allocation. In 1990-91 we saw an increse in expenditure on bed and breakfast from Â£20,00 to Â£200,000. For the first time, Bradford had a long-term bed-and-breakfast accomodation problem on its hands. Last year, 2,300 people were assessed as priority homeless. Because of the loss of housing stock during the past 12 years we were able to house only 975 of them and 1,200 people were left in bed-and-breakfast accommmodation. In addition, more than 4,000 families are trapped in flats waiting for houses that they cannot have because the majority of houses have been sold. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bow and Poplar (Ms. Gordon) said, bad housing affects education. We all know that substantial research has been done which shows that one of the major influences on children's educational achievement is their environment. Stress caused by poor accommodation leads to family break-up which in turn means that two units of accommodation are needed, adding to the problem. Such stress in turn makes demands on the health service. For far too long, the indirect consequences of the Government's housing strategy and the costs associated with it in other areas have never been brought together. Because of the ludicrous housing subsidy rules, we now have the poor subsidising the poor. In 1990, Â£8 million in housing subsidy was lost from the housing revenue account. This year that figure has risen to Â£10 million. That has produced a rent increase of Â£6Â·20 which means that housing benefit must be increased-a rising spiral in subsidy. In Bradford we have seen the rise of disreputable second mortgage companies which will advance money at extortionate rates of interest. At the first failure to pay they will go to the county court for a possession order. Last week, one of my constituents came to see me. She may have been foolish, but never mind that. She had taken out a second mortgage to the value of Â£19,000 and-having, perhaps, taken less than the best legal advice-had signed a document that would lead to her losing her home three years later. Meanwhile, her debt stands at Â£31,000. That is the legacy of the 1990s, when the present Government created the myth that it was possible to extract the equity from a property and thus dispense with all worries. Now all the chickens are coming home to roost. I will say little about the building societies. By and large, they are well intentioned; they have been led up the garden path by the new powers that they have been given, and now want to turn themselves into banks. We all know what that means. What, then, is the solution? Both the Minister and Opposition Members have talked about housing strategy. I only wish that there were a housing strategy. We need a strategy that recognises all tenures and all agencies, and makes no excuse for bad management by local authorities, building societies or private landlords. We need a strategy that reflects market forces. Nine thousand people are on the waiting list in my local authority area, because they want low-cost public-sector housing. The market is there; when will supply match demand? In the past 10 years, the number of housing starts in West Yorkshire has fallen from 20,000 a year-both public and private-to 8,000. An indirect consequence of that pattern, which has been repeated across the country, is the fact that some 250,000 construction workers are now on the dole. We need that new strategy soon and we need similar strategies to deal with associated problems in, for instance, education and health. The Minister said that far too many people lived in estates that had been designed by people who did not live in them, and would not want to. Let me tell him that far too many local authorities' housing policies are being determined by civil servants who live in London, and are acquainted only with London problems. They have no conception of life outside the metropolis, because they venture further afield only on overseas trips.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,76,housing,833
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],289,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"Nothing in the debate has suggested that the Government appreciate the seriousness of the housing problem. Indeed, everything that we have heard suggests that they are as complacent as ever. If nothing that my hon. Friends have said has had the desired effect, I should perhaps remind the Government that housing investment in this country has collapsed from 6 or 7 per cent. of gross domestic product to about 2 per cent.-far lower than the proportion spent in any comparable European or western country. We see the evidence on our streets, and also in the many reports that reveal the current decay in our housing stock. No one listening to the debate would gain the impression that the Government, or their supporters, were even aware of the reports by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Public Accounts Committee or the Select Committee on the Environment-or, indeed, of the report by the Association of District Councils, which seems to have had no impact on the Government, although the ADC is composed of their friends and supporters. Listening to the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. French), no one would think that there was a housing problem in his constituency; yet Conservative councillors from that borough have asked me to try to persuade the Government to allow them to use capital receipts to replace housing costs in rural areas. I have received similar representations from other parts of the country. The Government are clearly prepared to ignore not only the Opposition but outside bodies.

1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],292,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"I shall not give way, unless I do so at the Minister's expense. That market share is now declining further, except at the upper end of the market-and it is rising at that end only because house prices are currently frozen, and landlords are letting on a short-term basis. When the housing market starts to pick up again, those short lets will come to an end, and the housing problem will recur. As the Duke of Edinburgh's report has pointed out-and as I have pointed out for many years-the private rented sector has declined because of our system of housing finance. Only at the margins is that decline connected with the Rent Acts-as evidence from Northern Ireland and, indeed, elsewhere will show anyone who cares to examine the details. The Government have fallen back on another example-empty properties. As Labour has said for some time, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) has said tonight, when there is evidence that a landlord has not acted properly-whether that landlord is Labour or Tory, council or public housing association, or, indeed, private-we shall take steps to ensure that the property in question is transferred to a manager who can manage it, in the private sector if necessary. Let me remind the Government, however, that 16 per cent. of their houses-35,000 properties-are empty. If they have read the reports of the Public Accounts Committee and the Select Committee on the Environment, they will know that only 2Â·5 per cent. of local authority houses are empty. Even authorities with larger housing stocks usually have special reasons. Where that does not apply, I would suggest transfer. I shall issue a challenge to the Minister, which he may wish to meet when he replies to the debate. In the Government sector, 35,000 properties are empty-and I emphasise that most are not needed for defence purposes. One in five London police houses are empty; prison officers' houses have been left empty for up to 10 years. In Archway, Department of Transport properties are even now being auctioned off, while many Ministry of Defence houses are being kept empty for sale by auction. I challenge the Government to transfer those properties, here and now, to housing associations or local authorities. It is a question of, "" Do it now-don't talk."" Let me tell the Minister what really happened about housing action trusts. I understand why he does not know: historically, housing Ministers in the present Government have lasted for an average of six months. The present Minister was not involved at the time; I give him full credit for that. If he had been, he would not have said what he did say. In the Committee stage of the Housing Bill 1988, we argued against housing action trusts. We said that tenants would not be forced out of the council sector; we also saw problems involving rent-setting mechanisms and so forth. Every one of the seven housing action trust areas identified by the Government voted them down. As a result of that pressure, and as a result of my taking groups of Members of Parliament to see the then Minister-the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier)-the Government began to shift their position. Now they are saying that tenants can go back to the council sector. Given that the tenants who voted the system down in the seven areas identified by the Government were not offered the special and favourable deals that are now being offered to Hull and Walthamstow, which I welcome, will the Minister now make the same offer to those tenants? They knew that they would be transferred. Furthermore, is he prepared to change the law, which, as it stands, is not commensurate with his offer? Let me say to the Minister what I have said to the Hull authority-I said it some time ago, and it is in writing. Those tenants will have the right to go back to either the local authority or another landlord of their own choosing; they need not go back to the local authority. Then there is the question of housing authorities. It is wonderful, is it not? Various hon. Members are falling in love with the housing association movement: terrific. I wish that it had been so throughout the 1980s, when the housing associations grant was cut time and again. Now they are only just getting back to where they were in the 1970s. What a damning indictment of the Government's policy. What else are the Government doing? One Minister -he is now Secretary of State for Health-promised to revive the co-ops. This year, the co-ops have had the lowest-ever allocation from the Housing Corporation-just 300 housing units. What a disastrous, incompetent measure. Let me make two points about ending transfers-and I address this to the hon. Member for Gloucester as well as to the Government. Can we have a guarantee that, whenever tenants are transferred, they will be given the money to take independent advice about the desirability of the deal? Some tenants have bought a pig in a poke. An example of that-it was not badly intentioned-is the Greater London council seaside homes where tenants ended up paying more than they were told that they would have to pay. It was the fault of the housing association in that it got its sums wrong, but that was not surprising in view of the circumstances of the deal. Those involved were not offered independent advice which might have warned them off. No one should be transferred without independent advice. I could make a success of a transfer if I were told that I could buy each unit for under Â£10,000, which is the maximum price for any house or flat in any total stock transfer that has taken place in Britain. Any fool could make a success of that. If one writes off all the debt, things can be improved. If it is such a good thing, why not do it for local authorities? The Minister says that we cannot have the capital receipts. He wants to do the equivalent of going home at night, finding that the roof is leaking and telling his family, "" I am sorry, the roof needs to be repaired but we should pay off the mortgage."" It is lunacy to use the money from capital receipts to pay off debts when there are so many homeless. It is also wicked. Therefore, the Government cannot use that excuse either. There is a campaign for rough sleepers. Homelessness is not just a London problem and it is nowhere near being solved. I welcome the units that the Government have made available, but more homeless people will come to use them. They will come from Gloucester, Taunton, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle. People will come from all over the place and the homelessness problem will continue to increase because, as the Duke of Edinburgh said, we have lost 1Â·9 million properties from the rented sector. The aggressive begging comes from the Government, begging for an excuse for policies that have failed the nation.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,80,housing,1184
1991-07-02,Housing [Opposition Day > 16Th Allotted Day],293,Tim Yeo,Con,False,"This has been an instructive debate on an important subject, and I welcome some of the contributions, including the eloquent plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Summerson) for a housing action trust there. I hope that the tenants will take careful note of what he said. I was interested in the suggestions of my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. French) for encouraging voluntary transfer. I shall draw the attention of the Department of Social Security to his remarks on housing benefit. I should like him to clarify his concerns about the Housing Corporation's attitude to circular 7/91. Perhaps he will do so in a letter. My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) made some powerful remarks about the revival of the private sector, the use of capital receipts and defective housing in his constituency. Almost all the other speeches were pleas for more money to be spent on council housing. Opposition Members ignored entirely the enormous resources that the Government are putting into the housing association movement. The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) is a former employee of Manchester city council. Before he asks the Government to put more taxpayers' money into that city, he should do something about collecting the Â£15 million of rent arrears which were outstanding at the end of 1990. The hon. Member for Bow and Poplar (Ms. Gordon) should ask why Tower Hamlets council had 1,758 empty council properties at 1 April 1990. Those were council properties built for council tenants. They were not built for policemen or hospital workers or for soldiers returning from abroad. They were meant for tenants and should be for tenants. They would be used by tenants if the Labour-controlled local authority did something about it. The debate has reminded the House how the Government's policies over the past 12 years have given Britain more and better housing than at any time in history. The policies have been based on expanding home ownership, which is the preferred choice of the vast majority of families and individuals. Home ownership is now at record levels and is expanding still further with the promotion of shared ownership schemes and other intiatives designed to bring owner-occupation within the reach of those for whom it was previously impossible. The Government's policies are also designed to improve choice and opportunity for tenants. They give all tenants more say in their own affairs. They target more resources where they are most needed and encourage the private landlord to play a bigger role in housing the homeless. The private landlord will have listened with interest to the reply of the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire). The hon. Member for Dagenham refused to say that the Labour party would abandon its crazy policy of giving private tenants the right to buy. If ever there was a sure way of ensuring that the private rented sector remained largely dormant, it was that threat of confiscation. The debate has also provided an opportunity for my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning to mention the hugely increased resources that we are putting into housing associations via the Housing Corporation and by making it possible for housing associations to tap private finance for the benefit of tenants. All those positive steps have been resisted in one way or another by the Labour party's dogged determination to continue living in the past. For example, the rents-to-mortgages experiment is now successfully under way in Basildon and Milton Keynes. That initiative manages to promote home ownership and extend the rights of tenants. It is sad but not surprising that no Labour Member today had a word to say in favour of that scheme. As it took so many years of proven Conservative success and overwhelming tenant enthusiasm before the Labour party replaced its obstinate hostility to the right to buy with its present grudging acceptance, it will be many more years before it gives the rents-to-mortgages scheme an unqualified endorsement. The debate also reminded the House of what the Labour party would inflict on tenants and landlords if it ever got the chance. We have had the usual hostility to the private landlord, thinly disguised inside the Labour party's so-called new agenda for the private rented sector. That agenda has been drawn up carefully to prevent private landlords from providing for poorer tenants. The initiative of my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning, the pilot scheme under which housing associations are invited to bid for an opportunity to manage private property on behalf of landlords and to act as an intermediary between them and homeless families, is worth while. It would have done the Labour party some good if it had thought to give that a favourable mention. The trouble is that at the core of the Labour party's policy is a deep-seated desire to meet every housing need by throwing huge sums of money at local authorities. The Government utterly reject that approach. Never again should tenants face the dreary monopoly of no alternative to a local council landlord. It was the excessive dependence on local authorities as the monopoly provider of subsidised housing which led directly to the dreadful conditions still found on many council estates today. That policy was utterly rejected by the Government but is still supported by the Opposition. It has given us more than 5,000 empty houses in Labour-controlled Manchester-more than one property in 20 of the total council stock. That same policy left more than Â£26 million of uncollected rent from tenants in Labour-controlled Southwark, almost one third of the annual rent roll. Labour councils cannot be bothered to collect the rents that would pay for the improvements and maintenance that we want tenants to receive, but the Labour leadership is certainly not slow in promising to spend huge sums of taxpayers' money. Exactly how much it would spend remains shrouded in some obscurity. The promises that fall glibly from the lips of the hon. Member for Dagenham may not have been approved by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett). When she was confronted with the ghastly reality that Labour's spending commitments would require a basic rate of tax of 40p in the pound, the hon. Member for Derby, South back-pedalled furiously. The hon. Member for Dagenham told the House last year that a Labour Government would immediately set in train a scheme costing Â£1Â·85 billion as a solution to the homelessness problem. Was that commitment cleared with the hon. Member for Derby, South? Later in the year the hon. Member for Dagenham was at it again. He told the Chartered Builder magazine that over Â£8 billion was promised for construction, repair and maintenance. I doubt whether that was cleared with the hon. Member for Derby, South. Perhaps she is not such an avid reader of that magazine as I am. When we talk of Â£1Â·85 billion here and Â£3 billion there, we are talking about real money. Those spending pledges are either a hollow and cynical sham designed to buy votes from every pressure group that presents itself on Labour's door, or they represent a clear and unambiguous threat to every taxpayer in the country-an attempt to cripple taxpayers and wreck the economy. Liverpool is a supreme example of what Labour rule can do to a once proud and prosperous city. Of all the disasters caused by Labour's administration in Liverpool, its housing is supremely disgraceful. There are over 5,000 empty council properties-one in every 12 owned by the council. That is the worst record of any local authority in the country. There is 16 million of uncollected rent-more than a quarter of the total rent roll. However, hope exists for Liverpool's beleaguered tenants in the form of a housing action trust. Last week the city council voted to start negotiations. I warmly welcome that change of heart, but does the Labour party? Is it still firmly opposed to housing action trusts? Will it threaten Liverpool council as it threatened Hull council with the winding up of a housing action trust before it has even had a chance to get under way? On this crucial issue of housing action trusts, the Labour party leadership in Parliament is opposed to its whizzo new moderate Liverpool city council. So deep and rigid is the attachment of the Labour Front Bench to out-of-date dogma that it cannot utter a word in support of its councillors in Liverpool, who are belatedly attempting to redress some of the wrongs that were inflicted on them in the early 1980s. A year ago tomorrow, the House debated a Labour motion on housing. In that year, Labour has learned nothing and forgotten nothing. The same touchstones have been uncovered-a slavish and unquestioning enthusiasm for the local authority monopoly landlord, the same profound hostility to extensions of tenants' rights, the same resolute determination to stop the growth in the private sector. Those were the solutions of the 1960s. They were mistakes then; they are irrelevant now. The House should reject the motion.",9132,"['Opposition Day', '16Th Allotted Day']",Housing,2,81,housing,1525

I had already decided not to speak for more than 20 minutes, not least because the Government are so embarrassed by this case that they are providing not only statements along the same lines as the private notice question but points of order which are designed to waste time. The motion refers, among other things, to the growing mortgage crisis and to the need for a mortgage rescue scheme. I note that in their amendment the Government cannot even bring themselves to mention the problem of mortgage repossession or mortgage debt. They try merely to avoid it, which is what they have done since the problem emerged so drastically. It is instructive to consider the Conservative party's promises to mortgage payers. I could take the House a long way back on that issue but I shall stick merely to the commitment that the party made in 1979 so that we can examine the record and see what it has achieved. On 23 February 1979 the Conservative central office said: "" The next Conservative Government will manage the economy to keep interest rates down and so reduce the cost of a mortgage."" The Conservatives were foolish and unwise enough to repeat the promise in the election manifesto of 1979. What happened? When the Conservatives won the election in May 1979, the mortgage rate rose sharply from 11Â·75 per cent. to 15 per cent. Mortgage rates have been below 10 per cent. for just two short periods since 1979. That is the extent of the failure of the Conservatives to deliver a clear promise in 1979 to keep mortgage rates and interest rates down. The ex-Prime Minister and other Conservatives had the audacity to say that interest rates were high in the early stages of the Conservative Government only because people were borrowing too much. It may be interesting to ask why interest rates are still high given all the Conservative promises about keeping them down.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,2,housing,415

1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],275,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend anticipates me. I will deal with that point in sequence. While the Prime Minister was Chancellor of the Exchequer, the mortgage rate was 15Â·05 per cent. for new mortgages, which was 2Â·37 per cent. higher than the average achieved under this Government and no less than 4Â·3 per cent. higher than the average under the Labour Government for the whole period from 1974 to 1979. In that respect, we draw attention not only to the high interest rate policy of the Government, but to their general failure to manage the economy. That rate was also the highest mortgage rate for any Chancellor of the Exchequer since, probably, the 1920s. It is difficult to check back with comparable prices beyond that. As Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Prime Minister presided over the highest rate of any Chancellor of the Exchequer. That is the measure of his failure. In their amendment, the Government claim that they are reducing interest rates, and this is where I come to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). The Government reduced interest rates before the general election in 1983. Immediately after winning that general election, they increased interest rates. They reduced interest rates immediately before the 1987 election. Immediately after they won that election, they increased interest rates. They did precisely the same when they won the election in 1979. We do not need to look into a crystal ball; we have the record, which all can see.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,4,housing,251

The figures refer to the whole period of office for each party. Under the Tories, the figure is 12Â·68 per cent. I refer to those figures in the context of a Government who enjoyed all the advantages of North sea oil wealth, of relatively low commodity prices around the world, and of privatisation assets, and who had none of the disadvantages of oil price rises, such as were experienced in the 1970s. Despite all that, the Government not only delivered two massive slumps, which had an effect on home ownership, but managed to deliver interest rates that were constantly 2 per cent. higher than they were on mortgages under Labour. That is a pretty damning indictment.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,6,housing,188

1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],283,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"You would rule me out of order, Madam Deputy Speaker, if I went too far down that road. Suffice it to say that the Government have taken away any real choice from the British people of going into a common European currency. When the previous Prime Minister signed the Single European Act, she more than anyone else put us on that course, as Conservative Members know. The Government's high interest rate policy, which they have pursued consistently since 1979, is the root cause of the housing crisis in owner occupation. Almost 100,000 homes will be repossessed by the end of the year. When I first gave that figure, people said that it would probably not be so high. Now I note that various people are saying that the total is likely to be 115,000. I will stick to my estimate of close to 100,000. About one in 12 people with mortgages are in mortgage arrears. The 100,000 repossessions this year compares with 2,500 in 1979. The figure of 100,000 is equal to the population of towns such as Oxford, Exeter, Norwich or Basildon. Many of those whose homes are repossessed will go into bed-and-breakfast or emergency accommodation. One in 12 mortgage payers are in arrears of two months or more. That means that roughly 1 million mortgage payers are in serious trouble. When I give the figures, I am not talking about people who hand in the keys. They are excluded. I am not talking about people who pay most but not all of their mortgage each month. We are talking about a minimum figure of 1 million. What is the other factor, along with interest rates, that is affecting us so drastically? It is unemployment. As we all know and as the Government concede, unemployment will continue to rise. All that the Government can say is that the rate of increase is less, "" seasonally adjusted""-the funny phrase that they use. The Government have already clobbered manufacturing industry in the north and they are now busy clobbering industry in the south. The net result is that unemployment in the south will, this time, rise far more drastically-and the rate of interest confirms that-than in other parts of Britain. That is why so many Conservative Members are quoted in Roof magazine as being worried about the issue. They are worried because most people in mortgage arrears or whose homes are being repossessed are in the south or the midlands-the areas having most problems with unemployment. The recession and the collapse of house prices that goes with it aggravate the problems in the south-and elsewhere in Britain. They mean that people cannot easily trade down. People who bought in 1988 when the market was high suddenly found in 1989, 1990 and 1991 that they were selling at a loss. So they could not even get out of their debt, let alone pay the mortgage. One would have thought that, faced with those figures, Ministers would express concern. I have drawn attention to the fact that in their amendment to our motion the Government cannot even bring themselves to mention the mortgage problem. What do Ministers say? One interesting idea comes both from the Minister for Housing and Planning and from his deputy, the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo). On a "" World in Action"" programme the Minister for Housing and Planning said that the best mortgage rescue service was a drop in interest rates. His deputy used that phrase too, on "" The Time ... The Place""-a programme on which I joined him. He told an audience of 50 or 60 people, all of whom had had their homes repossessed, that help was on the way because mortgage rates were coming down. I have to tell him that to someone whose home has been repossessed it makes no odds whether the interest rates are going up, down or sideways. It is too late for them. It is too late for many people, because even if interest rates came down by another 1 per cent. tomorrow-they will not-the repossession figures would continue to rise. Sadly, the prediction for the number of repossessions in a year's time is still about 100,000. On 2 July the Minister for Housing and Planning said: "" I do not accept the gloomy forecasts that are made of future repossessions. Those who coped during the period of rising interest rates should be able to cope as they fall. I would therefore hope to see fewer repossessions."" The hon. Gentleman said that only four months ago, yet it does not look too convincing now, does it? What else do Ministers say? Another response, which has not been used so much recently, was by the previous Minister responsible for housing, who is now the Secretary of State for Employment. Under a nice headline in the papers saying: "" Lodgers can ease mortgage bills, says Minister"", the right hon. and learned Gentleman was reported as stating: "" Lodgers now had no security of tenure"" -that was a result of the Housing Act 1988- "" making it easier for householders to repossess the property...'With a minimum of effort people can raise extra income to offset the increased cost of their mortgages. That has to be good news for lenders.'"" What has happened since then? One problem, which we tackle in the mortgage rescue scheme, is that when people who have taken out a mortgage have a lodger, when the house is repossessed the lodger, too, will be made homeless. What is more important, in a significant minority of cases, the lodger does not even know that the mortgage is in arrears. There is a recent case in Camden, and I could name many others. The first that the lodgers know of the threat of eviction is when it takes effect and the bailiffs appear at the door. That kind of thing was encouraged by the Minister who was responsible for housing at the time. The Government have still not dealt with it. They hoped that the building societies would change the rules. The story from which I have just quoted was based on a call to the building societies and banks to change the rules, but they did not do so. The Government amendment says that they have achieved "" diversification of tenure"" among other things. Does that mean that more people are sleeping rough in the streets and more are in bed-and-breakfast and emergency accommodation? Let us remember the Rowntree report-the Duke of Edinburgh's report-the second edition of which was published in July or August this year. It said that almost 2 million-1Â·9 million-homes had disappeared from the rented sector since 1979, half from the council sector and the other half from the Government's much-loved private rented sector. When the Labour party left office, private rented accommodation accounted for 14 per cent. of the rented market. Now it is only 7 per cent. There has been a marginal increase in middle and upper rent areas, but almost certainly that rise is due to the depression in house prices. When prices start to rise again a lot of the people in such accommodation will be evicted, because they have assured shorthold tenancies and it only takes six months to get them out. Then homelessness will increase again. That is what the Government are boasting about. We cannot get rid of 2 million homes from the rented sector in 12 years, and neglect to put anything in their place, without expecting a dramatic and growing housing crisis. The collapse in the construction industry-another aspect of our concern about the state of the economy-confirms that crisis. I could use more than all the time allowed me simply in quoting the views of the construction industry, many of whose companies bankroll the Tory party. It is interesting that the number and amount of such contributions have been dropping rapidly. That is not entirely surprising when we read what Sir Clifford Chetwood, the chairman of Wimpey, backed by the building material producers, is reported as having said about the construction industry: "" This is an industry in crisis...In terms of workload and order books things are getting worse. There are harsh times ahead ... Britain was on the brink of a housing crisis that would leave a shortfall of more than 1 milion homes between those being built and those needed."" Lest hon. Members should think that I am quoting an out-of-date report, I must tell them that what I have said is taken from yesterday's report in The Guardian of Sir Clifford's speech and the survey undertaken by the National Council of Building Materials Producers. Many other examples show that the construction industry is in desperate trouble. Increasingly, it supports the call from ourselves and from Conservative-controlled local authorities that authorities should be allowed to spend their capital receipts on housing investment, to boost the industry.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,12,housing,1487
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],284,Jonathan Sayeed,Con,False,Can the hon. Gentleman tell me of any year during the past 30 years when the construction industry said that it did not want local and national government to spend more money?,9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,13,housing,32
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],285,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"Yes, that was so for about two years in the mid-1980s. In the first part of the 1980s the industry was desperate because of the slump; in the mid-1980s it enjoyed the boom; now, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is experiencing the bitter wind of another Tory slump. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention, because it proves my point and illustrates what we mean by the Government's inability to manage the economy. They talk well, they talk the economy up and talk about management, but their record on interest rates, on the productive base of the economy and on great industries such as the construction industry tells a story of failure, of how weak we have become. Even if we were to launch a major housing investment programme now, the construction industry could not deliver quickly without sucking in imports. It has not invested here because the Government have not given it the confidence to do so. There is also a lack of skilled labour. Soon 250,000 construction workers will have been lost to the industry as a result of the recession. Sadly, contrary to popular opinion, the skilled labourers lost in that way do not automatically come back into the industry when it re-expands. We have had to take that problem on board in devising the policy that we shall put into effect in government. The danger is that, even if one wanted a rapid building programme and had masses of money to carry it out, one would still be restrained by those bottlenecks. There would be a danger that untried, untested techniques for building high-rise or prefabricated dwellings would be adopted. We have set our face against that, but I can see the present Government trying to get away with it; they have cut corners with that sort of housing before. The Government are trying to introduce schemes that they hope will buy off the voter and somehow divert attention from the mortgage crisis. The Minister recently introduced a half-baked scheme, with the support of the Council of Mortgage Lenders-or rather, of one individual who works for that council, who believes that it is a good idea. Many of the building societies are not so convinced. Basically, the idea is this: when a property is repossessed, the building society or bank informs the housing associations, which then decide whether they can take the property over on a temporary basis and rent it to someone in emergency accommodation. I call the scheme half-baked, Madam Deputy Speaker, because, if you were in the unfortunate position-which I hope you are not-of having been put into bed-and-breakfast accommodation having had your house repossessed, a housing association might come along and say, "" We have a property in which to rehouse you, and you could find yourself back in your own property. Theoretically, that could happen, although statistically you would be more likely to end up in someone else's property"". Surely the Government have the wit to understand that that is a chronically inefficient way of dealing with the problem. I do not think that I am making an accusation that the Government would challenge when I say that the main aim of the scheme is to boost house prices by holding back from the market repossessed properties, which now account for about one in five of the properties being sold and which are depressing the property market. We propose something rather better than that half-baked scheme. For a year now, we have been saying that the Government should urgently call in representatives of the housing associations, the main lenders-the building societies and banks-and the local authorities to set up a proper mortgage rescue scheme. Let me describe how that would work. The first aim must be to allow people to buy time-and buy it for no money-in a way that is advantageous even to the building societies and banks. If the Government were serious, they would take on board our suggestion and say to lenders, "" You can repossess but you cannot evict straight away."" Let me explain the advantage of that. It normally takes building societies and banks a minimum of six months to sell a repossessed property, and it often takes much longer. Moreover, when they sell, they do so at below the normal price. We say that they should let the person stay in the property as an assured shorthold tenant for, say, six months or a year. That will give the lending institution a definite date at which it knows that it can sell with vacant possession; but, above all, it will give the individual or family concerned time to work out their options. It will also give time to consider the second part of our package-the mortgage rescue itself-which will clearly be of value to everyone. Another advantage of that arrangement is that it will give the bank or building society an income, in the form of the rent, instead of perhaps facing a loss in the form of a management fee payable to a housing association or local authority. A property that would otherwise stand empty could be pulling in a rental income as well as providing a roof over people's heads. Finally, we, the poll tax payers, would not have to pay for families to go into bed-and-breakfast accommodation-the worst type of subsidy to give for mortgage rescue purposes-as we do at the moment. It is a crazy system. What are we doing turning the dream of home ownership into the nightmare of bed-and-breakfast accommodation, paid for by the poll tax payer? That must be gross incompetence as well as lack of concern. The second part of our mortgage rescue package is the option of shared ownership. Many people are in trouble with their payments and are headed for repossession and, at present, there is no alternative to that, even though, in many cases, their incomes may not have dropped so catastrophically that they cannot pay part of the money that they owe. I am talking, for example, about people who lose overtime earnings and so on. In such circumstances, it would be sensible to allow a local authority or housing association to buy the property and immediately sell part of the equity to the occupier, who would then pay part rent and part mortgage and who could step back to full ownership when his financial situation improved. That would help a lot of people. Another critical part of our package concerns help for those in dire trouble because of a family breakdown-the classic example-or because the wage earner in the family has lost his job and has no possibility of finding another in the reasonably near future. Families who lose their income completely often end up in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. It is not only more humane but infinitely better financially, both for the country and for the families, to allow a housing association or council to buy the property and to transfer the people living in it to the tenanted sector. The Council of Mortgage Lenders estimates that the cost of those two schemes would be a sinking fund of Â£100 million. The House should bear in mind the fact that, for mortgage repossession cases only, in London alone, the cost of bed-and-breakfast accommodation is more than Â£50 million, and that is without taking into account many of the other associated costs.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,14,housing,1232

1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],289,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"I want to move on because I am already exceeding the time limit that I set myself. Why will not the Government consider such a scheme? There are a number of reasons, both hidden and real. They tend to argue that it could be too expensive-in terms of each individual house. That is easily dealt with: one simply has a cut-off point. No one is suggesting that one should buy back a Â£1 million house. More important, the Government sometimes say that people would deliberately over-mortgage, knowing that they could be saved-that they would buy much bigger houses than they need. That is not real. Some months ago, I explained that a mortgage rescue scheme would not necessarily entail a person staying in his own house. Let us take the example of a family split-by no means a fiddle. Let us say that there are four children, two of whom go with the partner who leaves and the other two of whom stay at home with the wife, who has no income, in a five-or six-bedroom house. In those circumstances, one could buy the property but move them elsewhere in the rented stock, releasing the larger property for a bigger family. Indeed, one could resell when the time was right. The mortgage lenders themselves know that a mortgage rescue scheme will have to happen sooner or later. They know that they are in trouble and, to their credit, they also recognise that they must pay some of the costs because they have made bad debts, and because such a scheme would allow them to avoid court costs. That is why they are prepared to consider the possibility of receiving less than the normal price for the house. We are witnessing some horrific scenes. The Minister will be aware of the case of a woman who appeared on the same television programme as me, who has a six-month-old child and a two-year-old child and whose repossession date is 25 December. If someone had told me that such things happened in the 19th century, I should have said, "" They cannot have happened very often."" But they are happening now, this Christmas. What are we doing? In Kent, I found a family who had been placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation by the Conservative council. The home of two couples was repossessed. They had been renting the house from a man who was not living there and who had not paid the mortgage. Each couple was paying Â£80 a week in rent, making a total of Â£160 per week. To my mind, that amount would more than have paid the mortgage in that area. Nevertheless, the house was repossessed. One couple went into bed-and-breakfast accommodation because they had a young child and the poll tax payer had to pick up the bill. Let us consider the case of the business man in north London who told the building society that it had overvalued his property by Â£20,000. The building society was a large and reputable company and denied the overvaluation. The man argued for a bit, but accepted its valuation in the end. He said, "" I am doing all the things that the Government want. I am a small business man and was buying my own house. My business has now gone bust, my house has been repossessed and the building society is not only claiming the house, but the Â£20,000 by which it was overvalued."" I have heard horror story after horror story like that.

My own view is that. given the right thinking, we might be able to go further in the talks that we would initiate in Government straightaway and deal with cases that go wider than the provisions of the homeless persons legislation. In that way, we might be able to get across the barrier between owning and renting by establishing some form of shared ownership. That is what we would do. There are already a number of mortgage rescue schemes. I suggest that the Government should seek to extend the London Quadrant Housing Association scheme to the whole of London. Why not? It would save money. We could also learn from the Clackmannan scheme, which is well known and well run. The scheme in Rochdale fell through because of the lack of Government subsidy and we are, therefore, still paying for bed-and-breakfast charges. Is that sensible? Of course not. The constituency of the Minister for Housing and Planning, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), has the seventh highest number of repossession court cases in the country. I advise him and the Government that they are risking the wrath of the electorate on this issue. There is no reason why home owners should be clobbered in that way. The Government should not have encouraged home ownership on such a scale, or got rid of the rented sector as they did, or followed that by putting up interest rates to make home ownership unaffordable for many people. Having pushed people towards home ownership by getting rid of the rented sector and driving rents up to market levels, the Government then put up interest rates, and yet they wonder why there are now queues of homeless people having to be paid for by the poll tax payers. The mortgage rescue scheme is an idea whose time has come. The only people who are opposed to it are a Government whose time has run out.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,23,housing,370

I invite the House to reject the motion and to support the Government amendment for a number of reasons. First, the policies of the Labour party would increase rather than reduce interest rates and would therefore make the position for home owners worse rather than better. Secondly, the speech that we have just heard from the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) failed in its duty to put the current problems in their proper perspective. It also ignored the underlying improvement which I am confident is under way as earnings increase and mortgage payments fall. Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman did not do justice to the wealth of help and support which is now available from lenders and the Government to borrowers in difficulties. He did not mention income support and, in particular, he underestimated the impact of the statement by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security earlier this month on income support for unemployed borrowers, to which I shall return. Finally, having urged the Government to introduce a mortgage rescue scheme, it became abundantly clear that the hon. Gentleman has no authority to commit the Labour party to any increase in public expenditure. When my hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) asked him who would pay for the mortgage rescue scheme, the hon. Gentleman quoted the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which said that it would cost Â£100 million and that the Government should pay. He then said, "" I have some sympathy with that. There is some logic."" However, the Labour party made no commitment this afternoon to funding any mortgage rescue scheme. I turn now to interest rates. Of all the impudence of which the Labour party may be guilty, it is difficult to match that part of the Opposition's motion which berates the Government for their interest rate policy. Opposition Members have opposed many of the measures on public expenditure and privatisation which have produced the fall in interest rates. A Labour Government would mean higher borrowing, higher interest rates and more pressure on home buyers. I repeat what I and my right hon. and hon. Friends said previously. I believe that the best mortgage rescue scheme of all is the prudent management of the economy, low inflation and lower interest rates. Over recent months, the Government, pursuing policies often opposed by Opposition Members, have reduced interest rates by 4Â·5 per cent. That is already leading to a renewal of confidence and real prospects for stemming the rise in unemployment. More jobs will feed into greater confidence in the housing market. The House should not underestimate the impact of those cuts in interest rates. They mean that the average borrower now pays Â£70 a month less than he did a year ago. With base rates falling and incomes for those in work rising, that source of pressure is clearly reducing.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,24,housing,607
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],296,Clive Soley,Lab,False,"The Government may have cut interest rates about seven times in a relatively short period, but they are still higher than the average under Labour. Why?",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,25,housing,26
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],297,George Young,Con,False,"If the hon. Gentleman is saying that interest rates have fallen by more than 4Â·5 per cent., which is the figure that I used, he will find that he is mistaken. The point that I was making is that that welcome reduction would not have been possible if we had heeded the advice of the Labour party, because it opposed many of the measures that made that reduction possible. I have charged the hon. Gentleman with failing to put the problem of mortgage repossessions in its proper perspective, so I shall now do that. Ten million home owners have a mortgage-one that they chose to take on after working out what they could afford. Against that, fewer than 0Â·4 per cent. of borrowers-about one quarter of 1 per cent. of all home owners-had their homes repossessed in the first six months of this year. That includes those who have given in their keys. More than 99Â·6 per cent. were not repossessed. As 2Â·3 per cent. of borrowers are in arrears of six months or more, that means that nearly 98 per cent. are repaying their mortgage as they agreed. The vast majority are coping. I do not in any sense belittle the distress of repossession or the problems associated with it and I shall deal with that point later, but the figures tell a very different story from that of the hon. Member for Hammersmith. Home ownership remains a sensible long-term investment for those who want the independence that it brings and who are confident that the financial commitment it involves is a reasonable one. Let me turn to the third and more substantial point-to those who do face difficulty and to the measures that are available to help them. Of course, I fully understand the trauma facing any family whose home is about to be repossessed. Many hon. Members have seen families in that position in their advice bureaux. Although the Government were not a signatory to the transaction freely entered into between borrower and lender, they should not and do not stand idly by when the borrower faces difficulties. But let me first of all make it clear that it is certainly not in every case that financial problems are the primary cause of repossessions. Marriage break-up and other relationship failures lie behind some; in others, there was initially an unrealistically large commitment. Over half the properties recently taken into possession by building societies were previously occupied by borrowers who either voluntarily relinquished or simply abandoned them, posting the keys back through the building society letter box. I hope, therefore, that one message at least will be clearly understood after this debate. All those in difficulty with mortgage payments should contact their lender at an early stage and talk through the problem with him. Many borrowers would be surprised at the flexibility and sympathy that are shown by many lenders. The advice of the Council of Mortgage Lenders is clear. If lenders are approached early, before arrears begin to build up, most will be only too happy to help borrowers by rescheduling payments, allowing interest to be capitalised where appropriate, or accepting less than the required monthly payment for an extended period if there is a reasonable prospect of the borrower then being able to resume full payment.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,26,housing,550

Those people are unable to repay their full debt which sometimes is as much as Â£40,000. They are made homeless and are left with a debt that they have no chance of repaying. Do the Government believe that that is the fault of the individual, or, like Pontius Pilate, do they claim that it has nothing to do with them? Who does the Minister blame?",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,28,housing,99
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],300,George Young,Con,False,"I am about to describe the solutions that are available to people who find themselves in such distressing circumstances. The Government are reinforcing the advice available to people in such circumstances by grant-aiding the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux for its work on money management counselling. Some owners can, of course, make their own arrangements to cope-often, many do. As the hon. Member for Hammersmith said, some have choosen to take in lodgers to help to meet their repayments while others have moved in with their in-laws and rented out their homes temporarily. The hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) asked who is to blame for the repossessions. At the time of the great lending spree, when some lenders were offering loans of up to four times salary and property prices were soaring, a few voices urged caution. Some people will believe that building societies and banks, which thrust loans upon their customers, can hardly walk away from the problem of arrears by simply demanding repossession, particularly when there is little prospect of selling the property to recover the debt. Surely it is better, wherever possible, to keep borrowers in their homes. I believe that the building societies are now beginning to accept that view, which will result in a reduction in the number of repossessions. They have a direct interest in reducing the number of properties repossessed-humanitarian, as well as financial. In fact, the help given by lenders is already considerable. The wide gap between those in arrears in one quarter and the much smaller number of repossessions in the next is testimony to the help which many thousands of households now receive. That help, of course, is not entirely altruistic. Building societies have a responsibility to their members, too, and banks and mortgage insurers have a responsibility to their shareholders. But those duties are leading to a great deal of effort to find new ways in which to help individual borrowers to stay in their own homes, either as tenants or in shared ownership. In each case the insurer or building society takes an equity share. All this we encourage. Some local authorities and housing associations are also helping borrowers to stay in their homes through shared ownership schemes. The local authority provides the capital cover for the housing association to buy the home and to sell a proportion of the equity back to the existing owner. Mole Valley, Rochdale, Clackmannanshire and Bromley all do this. Local authorities have to weigh up carefully the benefit of doing so in the light of local circumstances and the costs that might otherwise fall on the authority. It is an option only where the borrower has suffered a reduction in income but not a dramatic fall. In those circumstances, the borrower continues to pay a smaller mortgage together with a subsidised rent. Together, those payments are likely, in a typical case, to amount to about 70 per cent. of the cost of the original mortgage. That is why, for most people, talking as early as possible to their lender is the best way forward. What action can the Government take? Direct Government help is targeted, deliberately, on the unemployed. If someone is unemployed and on income support, the cost of the interest on the mortgage will be met through enhanced income support. In 1990, more than half a billion pounds was made available in that way. This year, the figure will be higher. The hon. Member for Hammersmith totally ignored that contribution by Government and the taxpayer. One problem is that not all this very considerable sum is used by claimants for the purpose for which it is made available. The Council of Mortgage Lenders estimates that perhaps as much as half may be lost in that way, with the result that repossessions take place unnecessarily. The change in administrative arrangements announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security and Disabled People on 5 November is therefore critical, because, in future, lenders will know when borrowers are applying for income support. The Department of Social Security will know if there is a history of arrears and will be able to make a direct payment to the lender, if that is desirable. No one eligible for income support need lose their home. The benefits of those changes will be felt next year. The hon. Member for Hammersmith tried to wave a magic wand with promises of a mortgage rescue scheme. I found that part of his speech unconvincing. The hon. Gentleman berated the Government for not introducing such a rescue scheme, but he was unable to commit his party to its introduction. The hon. Member for Clydesdale referred to repossessions and I would like to mention a separate but important initiative aimed at making use of properties which have already been repossessed and which might otherwise stay empty. Earlier this summer, my Department set up a number of pilot schemes designed to bring back into use some of the 600,000 properties lying empty in the private rented sector. Under that scheme, housing associations act as managing agents for private owners who might not otherwise want the hassle of letting their property. That scheme will open up a valuable source of additional housing, by giving private owners the confidence to let their property and tenants the promise of a fair deal. The building societies, which have up to 40,000 empty properties awaiting disposal, asked whether they could build upon the pilot schemes. Rather than allowing all those properties to remain empty until they were sold, the building societies agreed that it makes sense to put them to good use. Many have already stood empty for some considerable time. As a forced sale, their value is less than it would otherwise be. There is a danger that they will be vandalised, or that squatters will move in. Under the new extension to the scheme, the empty repossessed houses on the building societies' books can be let to housing associations for periods of between one and three years, and occupied by families. Later, when the property is eventually sold, the lender should get a better price than he would from a forced sale now. The scheme also reduces the losses of the borrowers. In the meantime, the property is maintained and squatting is eliminated. The process also helps to stabilise house prices by controlling the rate at which empty property is offered in the market. Far from being half-baked, the scheme works to the benefit of all involved. The Government's philosophy is to maximise investment in housing from all sources-from the private sector as well as from the public sector-and to achieve maximum value from that investment. We are offering people opportunities for home ownership and opportunities for new forms of social landlord such as housing action trusts. We want to promote partnership-between local authorities and housing associations, between public and private finance and between social and private landlords. More importantly, we want to promote partnership between all those groups and the tenants themselves. We are seeking to improve the effectiveness of public sector investment and are attacking incompetence by local authorities. Those policies run with the grain of people's aspirations and with the grain of market forces. For that reason, they are more likely to succeed than the somewhat muddled, uncosted proposals which the Opposition often put forward. Their blinkered approach to housing action trusts and large-scale voluntary transfers-being actively considered by Labour councils and supported in ballots of tenants-shows how out of touch they are. The hon. Member for Hammersmith seems to think that he could increase spending on housing, without incurring the displeasure of the shadow Chief Secretary, by spending capital receipts. That is nonsense. The money is not just sitting in the bank doing nothing. The capital receipts are used to reduce the level of debt. Let me spell it out clearly. Those capital receipts have either paid off debt or are earning interest which authorities can use to service their debts. If local authorities were told to spend those notional receipts, they would either have to borrow again, or the Exchequer would have to give authorities more subsidy every year to meet their debts. Either way, we would then have higher borrowing or public spending with the usual impact on interest rates and the public sector borrowing requirement-and the raised eyebrow of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett). One cannot use those capital receipts without it having an impact on public expenditure. That money is not just sitting in the bank doing nothing.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,29,housing,1429

1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],310,George Young,Con,False,"The hon. Member for Hammersmith said that he would speak for 20 minutes and then spoke for 35 minutes. I hope that other hon. Members can be called, but they will not if I continue to give way. Those who live on council estates are rightly concerned not so much with the global sums, the billions of pounds, but with what is actually achieved: the quality of service and the range of choice that they are offered by their landlord. In some cases, local authorities use their resources and manage their stock well. Sadly, in others they do not. In some-mostly Labour-run authorities-resources have been poured in by the Government year after year with little to show for it, because those authorities have mismanaged the funds. They do not apply them where they will have the greatest and most beneficial effect and they do not involve the tenants, or voluntary or private sectors to get the benefit of their knowledge and experience. In short, they use no initiative and show no inspiration in dealing with housing problems. One has only to look at Meadow Well in Newcastle or at some of the worst estates in Liverpool to see what effect they have had. Keva Coombes, the former leader of Liverpool council, said: "" Tenants get an appalling service, and they know that. I think probably the fundamental cause is, frankly, we've put the interests of the providers of the service, the workforce, above the interests of the tenants"". He also said: "" We are the worst landlord in Liverpool, probably in the country...voids gone up, rent arrears soared and breaking the law on racial equality"". Manchester has 6,000 empty properties-more than any other local authority. Four Labour-controlled local authorities in London failed to collect nearly one third of rents in 1989-90. To overcome problems like that, we have introduced a significant change in our approach. In future, in allocating capital resources to local authorities, we shall rely less on allocation by formula and more on an assessment of the quality of authorities' plans, to direct resources to those councils where they will be used best. In that way, we shall get better value for money, tenants will see tangible results and standards will rise as authorities realise that they need to make a greater effort in order to gain support. We want to hear not only about problems but about solutions. The Labour party has resisted wave after wave of innovative Government policies until finally public opinion overwhelms it. One of the most recent examples of that attitude has been towards housing action trusts. Originally implacably opposed to the idea that rundown estates should be handed over to the tenants, housing associations and the private sector, Labour now finds itself in the embarrassing position that many of its own councils are pressing for HATs in their areas and tenants are voting to leave the control of those councils. So far, the Labour party has taken only one grudging step back and agreed to honour any existing contracts into which existing HATs have entered, in the unlikely event of their gaining power. But the waves are lapping round their feet and soon they will have to beat a full retreat as HATs become more popular and the Labour party's opposition to them another potential vote loser. We must make better use of existing stock. In too many cases, authorities take too long to re-let vacant properties. Homes stand vacant while families awaiting rehousing have to stay in bed and breakfast. If all authorities achieved an average target of six weeks in London and three weeks elsewhere, the effect would be equivalent to 17,000 extra lettings in England, compared with 13,000 families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. It may sound obvious, but it is important that local authorities should know who is living in their stock. It is just bad management that on many estates authorities have no accurate record of the people occupying their properties and some of those people have no legal right to be there. Finally, on the problem of those who literally have no home-the rough sleepers-considerable progress has been made as a result of my Department's Â£96 million initiative to help people sleeping rough in central London. Hon. Members need not take my word; they can ask the voluntary organisations. In total, 1,500 places have been provided in less than a year and taken up by people who were sleeping rough or were at risk of doing so. Moreover, 176 spaces are still in use in shelters that we opened last winter. By March 1994, the total additional permanent housing generated by that initiative will provide accommodation for 1,800 people. The measure has already made a significant contribution to the housing needs of single homeless people in London. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many voluntary groups and housing associations that have helped us to make this possible. It is our stated aim to make it unnecessary for anybody to sleep rough on the streets of central London. We have introduced more than money and hostels; we have introduced an integral approach, with training, employment and health. More needs to be done to achieve our aims. I am today announcing a new package of measures to help single homeless people sleeping rough in London and around the country. In London, where the problem remains at its most acute, I have set aside Â£1 million for voluntary groups to enable them to provide up to 300 places in emergency shelters this winter. Those places will be open regardless of temperature. I am pleased to say that nearly 200 places will be available next week. That provision is part of a co-ordinated programme which we are funding through Single Homelessness in London. We are making it as easy as possible for rough sleepers to use those extra places: they are free; people will not be required to give personal details if they do not wish to; and we are providing the outreach workers with vans to take rough sleepers to the shelters from pick-up points across the capital. Information on vacancies will be readily available, primarily from the Shelter Housing Aid Centre's hostels vacancy project and, out of office hours, by Shelter's nightline. Both projects are funded by my Department. SHIL has done well in its speedy organisation, as have the other voluntary organisations involved in setting up the programme. I am also announcing today that funding for the programme of grants under section 73 of the Housing Act 1985 to voluntary organisations for the homeless throughout the country will increase from Â£4Â·5 million this year to Â£6Â·1 million in 1992-93-an increase in real terms of around 30 per cent.-and to a total of nearly Â£20 million over the next three years.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,39,housing,1134

1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],319,Ashok Kumar,Lab,False,"In addressing the House today I bring a strong message from all the people of Langbaurgh who cast their votes in the by-election on 7 November. During my time in the House I intend to speak for all those voters and represent, to the best of my abilities, the needs and aspirations of my constituency and the wider northern region. It has been said that Langbaurgh was discovered by the national media during the by-election, and many representatives of the media were amazed to find-to quote The Times- "" the constituency was surprisingly beautiful."" I suspect that many of the people who flocked into the constituency from outside-the media, the party hacks and the pollsters-were surprised to find, not grim steelworks or a photo-chemical smog, but pleasant villages and estates, and attractive countryside and coastline. That is not to say there are no problems in my constituency-there are. Many of them are common to the whole northern region: unemployment, under-investment, isolation and Government indifference. It was due to the popular recognition that the Labour party intends to tackle those problems boldly and head on that I was returned to the House. I represent a constituency that is a microcosm of British society. It includes former mining villages, large council estates, market towns, seaside resorts and leafy suburbs. It was that cross section of British society which returned a Labour Member to the House, and which will return a Labour Government at the next general election. Langbaurgh was previously represented by Richard Holt, whose death precipitated the by-election which became a vote of confidence in the Government whom he supported. His time in the House was marked by a style of politics which, it could be said, led to his success in bucking the electoral trends in both 1983 and 1987. Certainly, the House will be less colourful and quieter with his departure. I also feel a deep sense of humility in following in the footsteps of Labour's pioneers in the area now covered by my constituency. The Labour party has never been afraid to field candidates who will, with vigour, promote the principles that they were elected to defend. I recall the Labour party's first Member of Parliament for the east Cleveland district, Billy Mansfield-an ironstone miner who left school at 13 and throughout his life, from the pit face to Parliament, fought for his class and his people. I also remember Ellen Wilkinson who colourfully represented the old Middlesbrough, East constituency throughout the early 1920s. She proved that a woman could successfully promote the needs, aspirations and dreams of a heavy, industrial region that conventional wisdom then held could not be won by anybody other than a man. I am proud and humble to be following that historic tradition and I will not shirk from being single-minded in fighting for the rights of my constituents. The great tragedy is that many of the social evils that those pioneers fought are with us again today. The simple fact is that far too many of my constituents are still unemployed, exist on low wages and are being denied access to the vital health and social services that they need to live a more healthy and less stressful life. It is little use senior Ministers telling local people that the recession is technically over. They should try telling someone who has lost his house that it was a technical repossession or someone who is still waiting for an urgent operation that he or she feels only a technical pain. Many of my constituents suffer from severe housing problems. Too many people are still inadequately housed, too many young people are still waiting for their first proper home and too many people in the villages of east Cleveland are still living in pre-1919 terraced houses that are long overdue for renewal and modernisation. A crying local need that is given public voice through Langbaurgh borough council's housing needs survey is for low cost accommodation for low wage earners. The distress that unemployment, poor housing, idleness and ill-health brings should be self-evident to everyone. It is evident to everyone except, it seems, for the Government's Front Bench team. In parts of Langbaurgh-in many of the isolated villages of east Cleveland and on south Middlesbrough council estates-high and continuing unemployment has become a feature of everyday life. For the one in seven of the total working age population who are unemployed in the south Middlesbrough area of Hemlington, or for the 19Â·8 per cent. of men who are jobless in the steelmaking town of Skinningrove, life is becoming ever more mean and brutish. The social isolation and poverty that comes with such unemployment is biting deep into the very fabric of our local society, and it is not so unexpected, is it, that such alienation has led to problems of split families, mental and physical distress, and the various manifestations of crime, vandalism and other forms of anti-social behaviour? That is not to say that crime can be excused-it cannot. But crime must not be used as an excuse for doing nothing about unemployment. During my time in the House I intend, in particular, to campaign vigorously for the total regeneration of my constituencys' economy. I will be fighting with my other Labour parliamentary colleagues on Teesside for more inward investment, for help to diversify and strengthen our local industrial base, and for vital Government and European funding to modernise and rebuild our physical, environmental, social and training infrastructure. The centrepiece of that work, that crusade, will be a new northern development agency. It will sweep away the collection of non-accountable, unelected quangos that pose as the Government's answer to regional needs. The agency will spearhead a new regional renaissance, bring clarity, cohesion and commitment to the need to renew the north of England. It will have responsibility for property assembly and development; and assist start-ups and growing firms. It will help to set up a northern export agency and, above all, help the technological uprating of northern industry. During the by-election I launched what I called a 10-point economic plan-a blueprint for Cleveland. That will be a programme for action in the run-up to the general election and a checklist for the action that the coming Labour Government will undertake through the support of the northern development agency. That programme will help to revive and regenerate our local economy. It calls for urgent action to pull Langbaurgh and the wider Cleveland area out of the vicious spiral of decline, dereliction and distress. It identifies the essential components, the key demands, of what I intend to call the new deal for Langbaurgh. First, as a practising research scientist I am only too aware of the need for pure and applied research within our industry and commerce linked to our university academics. We desperately need a technologically advanced economy. We need to set up a new and innovative Teesside technology trust, an instrument to effect proper collaboration between industry, local institutions of higher and further education, regional financial institutions, local councils and training providers and, of course, the European Community. That will provide the structured environment in which local industry can identify its technology and research and development needs, liaise strongly with the public sector and work with local academic institutions. As I have already said, I welcome the fact that the coming Labour Government will set up, as part of the popular move towards regional government-a move which I whole-heartedly support-a northern regional development agency. I intend to see that firms in my constituency benefit from the work of that agency, which should set tough but realistic targets for local jobs created and for local investment. I also intend to fight for the creation of a one-stop shop for local industry so as to stop the bureaucracy and confusion of five different Government Departments all attempting to help start-ups or small and expanding businesses. This office would work with local councils, local enterprise agencies and a democratised enterprise council to offer a direct business advice service. Crucially, I want to see the launch of an emergency jobs and training package for my unemployed constituents. That package could include direct job experience-training and job seeking opportunities provided under one roof. As those who are close to me and those who witnessed the by-election campaign know, I have always argued that individual opportunity and the economic success of one area are linked. Our economic destiny-nationally as well as locally-will be largely determined by the skills and talents of local people. We need to create a training scheme for local people and local industry. It is not enough to try to force local people and industry to conform to a remote central training plan devised and monitored by distant civil servants or by the shadowy private offices and right-wing think tanks servicing the employment Ministers. But that by itself is not enough. We need to see that all local people are able fully to participate in the local labour market. There must be a level playing field so that all people can exercise their talents and ability. Problems of disability, special needs, or the availability of child care facilities should not needlessly deny someone the chance of competing equally in the jobs market. I intend during the coming weeks-as a matter of urgency-to begin discussions with Cleveland local education authority and the local voluntary sector to formulate proposals for a properly funded and wide ranging child care strategy for Cleveland. The issue of industrial pollution figured prominently in the by-election campaign. Environmental awareness is now a key feature of everyday life in Cleveland. Local industry, which is often unjustly attacked, is trying hard to improve its record on pollution and environmental care. It has got little or no help from the Government in undertaking this responsibility. As a trained scientist, I am well aware of the scale of the problem and of the means and resources needed to tackle it. I want to promote a new Cleveland-wide programme of applied research into new pollution control, waste minimisation and recycling measures and technologies that will serve to make the county of Cleveland and its industry an internationally recognised centre of excellence in the nation's arid the industrial world's battle for a cleaner, greener and more sustainable environment. Langbaurgh, Cleveland and the wider northern region realise-perhaps more than the Government-that we are living in a world where new trading partners and new markets are developing at a headlong pace. The advent of the single European market and the implications of the Maastricht summit will affect us all, and none more so than those who, if nothing is done, could he consigned to the periphery of what may well prove to be the most important global trading bloc of the 21st century. By contrast, the Government seem interested only in placating or fooling as many of their Back Benchers as possible for as much time as possible over the full implications of an issue which cannot go away, however much the Government might wish otherwise. We recognise the importance of our new European home, even if the Government do not, and I shall continue to press for more investment to ensure the maintenance of Langbaurgh's essential trade with Europe and to see that the links to the channel tunnel, our local ports and our local Teesside airport are as well resourced as those of our competitors on the European mainland. Finally, and most importantly, we need a totally new regional policy. But this cannot be just a faded imitation of the regional policies of past Governments-Labour or Tory. The problems are greater and the challenges more pressing. Langbaurgh, Cleveland and the northern region have suffered draconian cuts in regional assistance and regional funding since 1979. Regional assistance for the counties of Cleveland, Durham, Northumberland, Cumbria and Tyne and Wear has been progressively cut by almost two thirds, a drop of about Â£3Â·4 million between 1979 and 1987. In the same period the region has experienced the biggest decline in manufacturing investment of any area in the United Kingdom-a decline of some 42 per cent. Under this Government, this gloomy catalogue of disaster, depression and decline is continuing. Figures from the jobcentres in Cleveland clearly show that there has been a drop of some 27 per cent. in registered vacancies since this time last year, and that the pattern shows no sign of abating. I know that Conservative Members would love me to speak about Cleveland county council. Above all, we desperately need to create sources of regionally-based finance capital, the cash that is needed if firms are to expand, start up or carry out technological uprating. Some far-sighted Labour local authorities in the region are already making great strides towards this goal. In particular, I congratulate Cleveland county council on its imagination and daring in setting up a locally based and locally run Â£5 million venture capital fund. That is a valuable weapon in the fight to revive Cleveland's economy. Such an initiative will be closely partnered and needs to work closely with my proposed northern development agency and the new national investment bank which will be set up by the next Labour Government, and which will play a key role in areas such as Langbaurgh in the mobilisation of private capital for publicly-led long-term investment projects to improve, enhance and uprate the infrastructure needed to sustain the economic growth for which my constituency is crying out. I want to stress again, so as graphically to underline the point, that Labour's victory at Langbaurgh has shown that the country wants change, is crying out for change, and is determined, at the polls next spring, to force radical change. In a famous debate in the House in 1940, a leading member of the then Labour Front-Bench team, Arthur Greenwood, was begged to "" speak for England""-an intervention that led to a change in Government. Over a half a century later, the people of Langbaurgh have spoken for England and their voice is finding an echo throughout the land. I both hope and believe that that voice will have the same result.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,48,housing,2359
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],320,Paul Channon,Con,False,"I am sure that I speak for the House when I say how much we appreciated the maiden speech of the hon. Member for Langbaurgh (Dr. Kumar). I am sure that the House will congratulate him on the excellent way that he delivered it, and on his courtesy, clear speaking and the interesting things that he had to say. Nobody yet knows whether his stay in the House will he long or short but, whichever it is, I hope that he will be happy and have an enjoyable and successful time here. We appreciated the hon. Gentleman's references to our late colleague, Mr. Richard Holt. He is much missed on these Benches and throughout the House, and it was good of the hon. Gentleman to pay tribute to him-we shall not forget it. I know the hon. Gentleman's constituency fairly well. It is a constituency of many contrasts. It is possible that, when the hon. Gentleman next speaks, he will find that the House does not agree with everything he says, especially if he repeats his last few remarks. However, tonight we shall not disagree with anything he said, at least not in public. I offer him many congratulations. I shall try to be brief, because many of my hon. Friends also wish to speak. I start by declaring an interest, as trustee of a charitable housing association. It is building a project in the constituency of the hon. Member for Langbaurgh, but I have not yet visited it. I do not often speak in housing debates. The last time I did so was in 1973, when I moved the Second Reading of a housing Bill, which the Labour Government took over and which became the Housing Finance (Special Provisions) Act 1974. I mention this because, the more I have listened to the debate, the more it has become clear that the old controversial arguments have not changed. Furthermore, it is also clear that, when both sides of the House agree on housing policy, we make progress, but when they cannot, we do not. In the 1960s and 1970s-I give credit to the Labour party for this-the improvement of older housing became a great bipartisan cause. In the 1970s, we all supported the voluntary housing movement, which the Bill that I introduced and the Act from the Labour Government did a great deal to support. All this shows that, when we agree, we have successes, and when we disagree, we have disasters. I do not wish to be controversial tonight, particularly as we do not have much time, but as the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) criticised the Conservative Government for bringing about the decline in the private rent sector, I should point out that the decline has gone on for a very long time. The Labour party's attitude towards rent control and the privately controlled sector, which has been maintained for a long time, has been largely responsible for the decline. As I understand it-no doubt the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth), who is to reply for the Opposition, will correct me if I am wrong-there is a suggestion of confiscation if private tenants are to have the right to buy. Perhaps he will tell us exactly what the Labour party's policy is. I very much welcome-indeed, I wish I had the chance to do this myself-the way that my hon. Friend the Minister has boosted the housing association movement. The number of houses in this sector has risen from 200 to about 500,000. I am certain that that will increase still further. I believe it to be a very important factor in the medium-term housing situation. I am sure that, after the next general election, there will be many more housing action trusts, and many more local authorities will want to transfer their properties to housing associations. There will also be a welcome increase in the amount of housing being built by the housing association movement. My right hon. Friends in the Department have managed to double the budget from just over Â£1 billion in 1991 to Â£2 billion in 1994-95, and 120,000 voluntary housing association houses will be built over the next three years. That is a great step forward, and I believe that it is the way forward for housing in the subsidised sector. I welcome the three-year approach, which will allow housing associations to plan their programmes properly. It was ridiculous that, in the past, a housing association would not know with any certainty what approvals it would get or how much money it would have beyond the end of the year. It is now much more likely to be rationally organised, and I congratulate my right hon. and hon. Friends on that. I also congratulate them on their approach to getting private finance. I am sure that we should get value for money in this sector so as to ensure that every penny of public money is spent in the best way to provide more housing for the people who so desperately need it. My hon. Friend the Minister has also launched a study recently into ways to attract yet more private finance into the housing association movement. I hope that he will be able to tell us how long the study will take and how he sees the way forward. Could not the Housing Corporation, which has large funds, do more? Is there no way, without breaking the public expenditure rules, to allow the Housing Corporation to invest or to go into partnership with a bank or the Housing Finance Corporation or a similar organisation? That would increase the amount of money available to be lent to housing associations, and lead to an even larger housing programme. Perhaps the answer is a mixture of public and private money-I do not know. Such a body might be able to lend at a better commercial rate, which would mean that houses would be cheaper and rents lower. I hope that the Minister's inquiry will look at that and other similar proposals. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to be careful about one point. It is true that costs are going down and that it is therefore reasonable to make a change in the total cost indicators. However, when housing associations plan a big housing scheme, they plan a long way ahead. They have to make some assumptions about future interest rates, and when they make proposals, they base them on such assumptions. If there are then frequent changes in the cost indicators and the grant is reduced, that is threatening for housing associations. I ask not that it should not be done but that it should be done infrequently, and that more notice should be given. That would mean more stability and confidence in the housing association movement. Will my hon. Friend look at the way in which homeless figures are recorded? Housing associations are probably doing much more to help the homeless than is shown in the figures. For example, I know of a case where a housing association bought a block of flats from some developers and allowed the developers to nominate to those flats. That vacated other flats that the developers had into which homeless people went. That did not show up as a single gain for the homeless in the statistics. There are many similar ingenious schemes around, but they are not sufficiently apparent to show how the housing association movement is helping to alleviate homelessness. The hon. Member for Hammersmith concentrated on mortgage repossessions. We have all heard of terrible cases in our constituencies. Anything that can be done is good, but we can do even more with housing associations. I was glad to hear what he said about the initiative on empty properties. Can we not have an even more active policy so that housing associations know all the practices among other housing associations? For example, if a housing association can buy a house from someone who has fallen in arrears with his mortgage, it should try to keep that family living there if that is possible. The hon. Member for Hammersmith criticised the Government's scheme, and I agree that it is a disaster if people have to be moved from repossessed properties into bed-and-breakfast accommodation. If a way can be found to keep them in their property, perhaps with a housing association managing it or acting as agent for the local authority, or encouraging the shared ownership about which my hon. Friend spoke, that would be much better. To do that, we need to study the best practice of housing associations. We need some imaginative scheme to help people who fall into arrears but who have not fallen into complete financial chaos. I strongly support the Government in their desire that the voluntary housing movement should be the main provider of social subsidised housing. The expansion of the voluntary housing movement is having an excellent effect on local authorities. Local authorities which face the prospect of losing their housing stock to a housing action trust will pay much more attention to their tenants than used to be the case. When the housing association movement grows and many more houses are transferred to it, as will probably happen, I hope that my hon. Friend will continue to keep an eye on it. There is no point in a transfer for the sake of it. The object of a transfer is to give the tenants a better deal. The day may come, although not for some time, when large housing associations have to be split up to prevent them from becoming unwieldy local authorities in their own right. The process of reform will have to be kept continually under review. No housing association has a large enough stock to be in such a situation now, but if they are not good enough and if they become impersonal and do not give the tenants the service they should, they should be subject to the same criticism as local authorities in a similar position. The point is to provide a better service and a greater opportunity to provide houses using public and private money to the best advantage. There are many other topics that I should have liked to talk about. The policies that my hon. Friend and his predecessors have pursued during the past few years, particularly last year-the new form of tenure, the new partnership, the maximum value for money, the mixture of public and private funds and the new forms of landlord-offer great hope. As we all know, there is at present a short-term difficulty. My hon. Friend is right to say that a reduction in interest rates would be the best news for those in difficulty with their mortgages, but in the medium term, my hon. Friends have laid a good foundation for British housing. I commend them, and I shall vote with enthusiasm for the amendment.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,49,housing,1823
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],321,Ronnie Fearn,LibDem,False,"After 12 years of office, the Government have little to be proud of when it comes to housing. They have presided over record levels of homelessness, record rent levels and record levels of house repossessions. The hallmark of any civilised society is its ability to house its citizens properly. People have a fundamental right to decent affordable housing, a right that the Government attempted to capitalise on with their ideology of a property-owning democracy. The right-tobuy policy was the Government's flagship in 1980, but because it was implemented as part and parcel of Conservative mania to reduce public spending and to restrict the powers of local government, it has contributed to the present scandalous homeless and housing crisis which is growing all the time. Shelter's most recent report put the number of homeless people at 350,000. Some estimates are set even higher, at 500,000. As many as 8,000 people sleep rough every night. Age Concern believes that 30 per cent. of those people are over 50 years of age, many of them with disabilities. But the number of disabled persons who are homeless arid on our streets are not just among the elderly. The November issue of Disability Now quotes a new survey in Nottingham carried out among 50 homeless people between the ages of 16 and 25, which found that the majority had disabilities. How the Government can come to the House today and call that a success is beyond belief. It is a disgrace. We are a supposedly civilised society approaching the 21st century, we have wonderful technology and great expertise, we play our part on the world stage-yet we fail miserably when it comes to housing our people. The previous Prime Minister held up a dream of home ownership. The Government raised expectations but failed to deliver to thousands of people. Not only that, they also took away the choice of how people housed themselves. The right to choose figured prominently in all the Government's rhetoric, but when policies were implemented, choice was eliminated for most people. The Government's housing policy was aimed at home ownership, to the detriment of the provision of affordable housing to rent. Many people looking for somewhere to live had little choice but to buy, often with 100 per cent. mortgages. For others, the opportunity was a dream come true. They believed the rhetoric and entered the property market. I accept that many of those people have never looked back, but thousands of others have. Mortgage repossessions have reached record proportions throughout the country. As many as 100,000 to 120,000 houses will have been repossessed by the end of the year. With the current level of people in arrears running at 750,000, of which 162,000 are more than six months in arrears, that figure is set to go even higher next year. The situation could be made worse if and when the housing market picks up because at the moment some building societies are holding back from repossessing because of falling house values. As soon as they see a turn in the market, they will begin the repossession process, and many more families will be evicted. The Government are in for a nasty shock. Come the general election, they may find themselves evicted from the House, but that eviction will be the result of their own actions, unlike the fate of many of the homeless and those who have had their homes repossessed. The Government have mismanaged the economy, introduced high interest rates, implemented housing policies but neglected the need for social housing and presided over the boom and bust cycle which has contributed to the depressed housing market. In recent weeks, the Government have tried to talk up the economy, but they have failed to convince anybody that recovery is around the corner. It is not difficult to see why the Government have failed when industries such as the construction industry are on their knees. As Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of Wimpey, was reported as saying in The Guardian on 26 November, the construction industry is in "" shocking crisis"", with no prospect of a return to growth until 1993. He has forecast 250,000 job losses by next summer, with as many as 5,000 firms going to the wall before the end of this year. He says that the country is on the brink of a housing crisis with a shortfall of 1 million homes. Some of us have been only too aware for a long time that housing in Britain was in crisis. Most of us have only to look around to see the homeless on our streets or to visit some of the homeless organisations such as the Simon community, which I have visited twice. There are many in that community who are sleeping rough. I expected there to be 40 in Lincoln's Inn Fields, but when I went, there were 260 people. Most of them have jobs; none of them have homes because they cannot afford the three months' rent. With the construction industry depressed, with some building societies and mortgage lenders in trouble and with unemployment continuing to rise, the housing market is set to continue to fall, and Britain's economic recovery will be further delayed. The Government must take the initiative and look to ways to reduce repossessions and the number of homeless and to provide more homes for rent. In the short term, much can be done which will have some immediate effect. The recently announced scheme to allow housing associations to take over repossessed homes to house homeless families for a year is a beginning, but if that is to be the only scheme, it is somewhat misguided. There is not much sense in turfing one family out into the cold in order to house another which, on present trends, will be homeless again within a year unless there is some guarantee of permanent housing. The Government must use their initiative and power to prevent repossessions in the first place. They must introduce sensible mortgage rescue schemes. The transfer of mortgages to shared ownership schemes with local authorities and housing associations is one such scheme which will work. Local authorities already have the power to set up mortgage rescue schemes with housing associations, but the Government should find ways to encourage the extension of such schemes. Mortgage lenders must take some of the blame for the current repossession crisis. I was pleased that the Minister mentioned that. Far too often in the past, lenders have been, if not irresponsible, over-enthusiastic. I do not want a return to the days when it was virtually impossible to obtain a mortgage, but I feel that lenders should be more responsible. Perhaps they will be: there is nothing like a nasty case of burnt fingers to restrict lending. Mortgage-to-rent schemes should also be encouraged, since they would benefit lenders as well as families in arrears. Rather than selling at auction, possibly at a loss, lenders could hold on to properties that might appreciate in value, while continuing to receive a regular income from those properties. Tenancies could be short or long term, and, if necessary, housing benefit could be provided to make the rent affordable. If such schemes are to appeal to building societies, they may have to be administered by local authorities or other housing agencies. A shared-ownership scheme would also benefit both lenders and families in arrears. Another possibility is a mortgage-to-rent scheme with the option to buy back. Regardless of which scheme is introduced, however, Liberal Democrats recognise that the lenders would need some assistance. We suggest that the portion of income support that is allocated for mortgage repayments be paid to them directly. Other problems also need attention urgently. The Government must tackle homelessness in general. To help young single people, we advocate reform of the social security system, enabling income support to be paid in advance and restoring the full rate of income support to the under-25s. Family credit entitlement should be adjusted to reflect liability for mortgage interest payments. The Government should also investigate the possibility of a housing benefit allocation that takes into account mortgage interest payments. I understand that reducing mortgage tax relief from 25 per cent. to 23Â·5 per cent. would release Â£400 million-the estimated cost of paying housing benefit for mortgage interest payments. That information is contained in a report by the Council of Mortgage Lenders entitled "" Time for Mortgage Benefits"", which is due to be published later this week. Perhaps the Minister will look at it. The lifting of the restrictions on capital receipts from the sale of council houses would provide an immediate injection of cash for the housing market. It would provide more homes, and it would also create jobs. Our party's programme would increase the percentage of council house and land sale receipts that can be spent by local authorities from 25 per cent. to 75 per cent. when the money is to be spent on repairs and renovation. The Government's housing policy has led to many untenable situations. Let me give an example of the ridiculous state of housing finance and the false economies that have been made. Because of the lack of affordable housing to rent, and the lack of funds to bring poor housing up to standard, many local authorities have to resort to providing bed-and-breakfast accommodation. According to the Audit Commission figures for 1990, the cost in the first year of such accommodation in London is Â£15,540; the cost in the first year of building a home to rent is Â£8,200. Outside the metropolitan districts, the figures are Â£5,475 and Â£5,000 respectively. Those figures speak volumes about the absurd way in which the Government run their housing policy. So far, the Government's response to the housing crisis has been dismal. Palliatives are not enough; we need fundamental change. Unless the Government take action now, the nation's housing needs will continue to increase and the current state of affairs will continue to go downhill.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,50,housing,1664
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],322,Timothy Raison,Con,False,"The debate has been marked by three speeches in particular. First, there was the maiden speech by the hon. Member for Langbaurgh (Dr. Kumar), which was heard with much appreciation. Then there was the speech by my right hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Channon). I served on the Standing Committee that considered the Housing Finance Bill in 1972: that was the longest Committee stage that we had experienced, and it seemed even longer than it was. I was struck then by the enormous skill and patience with which my right hon. Friend handled the Committee: he provided a model for others. I support his view that progress can best be achieved when there is a measure of agreement between the parties. As always, we heard a very good speech from my hon. Friend the Minister, who dealt effectively with the somewhat lengthy speech by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). My hon. Friend demonstrated that the Government care a great deal about the problems of people who are having difficulty in making mortgage payments, and that a number of effective actions are being taken. We were pleased to hear that, for real distress is plainly being caused. There is no doubt that the measures that we took in the 1980s to widen home ownership were completely justified. I do not accept for a moment that the existence of the problems that I have just acknowledged undermines the enormous success and importance of that move. We all know that our policy in that regard will not be reversed by any other political party. However, we also know that housing policy cannot stand still. There are always new problems: we never reach a happy plateau on which there is nothing to worry about. We should be concerned about the difficulty of providing low-cost housing, for instance. That difficulty is partly due to demographic factors. It is also due to family breakdown, which, sadly, is placing a good deal of pressure on housing, as most of us know from our constituency surgeries. We must tackle that problem. We could gain some useful assistance with overall housing strategy from the excellent report that followed the Duke of Edinburgh's inquiry into British housing, which came out in the summer. I should have liked to say more about that, but time is short. My constituents are likely to experience worse problems over the next year or so. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will recognise that, and will ensure that our policies can help. The essence of the problem is the drying up of council building, and the lack of housing association building to offset that. Until now, we were doing reasonably well. Our building programme has worked, although there has never been much housing association building for general needs. I fear that we are going to run into difficulties. Approval for new council building in my area has been ended. There has been a sharp drop from an allocation of more than Â£3 million in 1985-86 for Aylesbury Vale district council to Â£367,000 in 1991-92, and that allocation is for improvements, not new building. This year, the waiting list will probably double. The council operates an extremely restrictive policy-it is pretty hard to get on to the waiting list-and the position is set to worsen. Homelessness increased by about 25 per cent. between 1990 and 1991. Only about 62 housing association units are planned for next year, and, while about 40 shared-ownership units were provided by the council this year, housing associations will provide only about 19 next year. All that will mean some fairly tough problems-not for me, because I shall not be standing in the next election, but for my successor. Wycombe district council will need, it estimates, about 1,500 units of low-cost housing over the next five years. That is based on need; it is not simply a question of demand. According to present plans, it looks as though housing associations wil provide only 300 of those units. It is likely, therefore, that there will be a serious shortfall in Wycombe district council's housing provision. It has to provide for 700 homeless people this year and it has 200 people in temporary accommodation. What is happening in my constituency cannot possibly be unique. It must be happening elsewhere. What can we do about it? First, we have to recognise the problems. I am sure that the Minister does recognise them. Secondly, I do not mind whether the problem is tackled by an increase in the amount of private rented accommodation, or by increasing the allocation to housing associations, or even by more cuts in council building. We still need a horses-for-courses policy. The problem must be tackled by one means or another. The debate has focused primarily on mortgage payments, but I hope that the Minister will bear in mind that in many parts of the country low-cost housing presents real problems. In their amendment to the motion the Government rightly say that housing policy is not about just one issue but about a wide variety of issues. I am confident that the Government will bring forward measures that ensure that low-cost housing can be made available to people who badly need it.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,51,housing,877
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],323,George Howarth,Lab,False,"This an Opposition Day. When the Liberal Democrats have a Supply Day I hope that the Chair will take into account the length of the speech of the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn). The debate has greatly benefited from the fine and comprehensive maiden speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Langbaurgh (Dr. Kumar). He demonstrated his deep roots in the constituency and his detailed knowledge of the problems that face it, as well as the qualities of the constituency. He demonstrated also the analytical skills which, as a scientist, he brings to the House. He analysed the problems faced by his constituency in the context of the Government's policy. We shall be pleased to listen to my hon. Friend on many occasions in the years to come. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) made a great deal of the recent 4Â·5 per cent. cut in interest rates. That is very important. However, the Minister failed to recall the fact that it was this Government who sent interest rates into the stratosphere. It is one thing to boast about a reduction in interest rates and the effects that may have had: it is another thing to claim credit for bringing them down, having sent them up into the stratosphere in the first place. Under this Government, average interest rates have been higher than at any time under any Labour Government. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) made abundantly clear, the Government's record speaks for itself. The Minister referred to the Labour party's response to housing action trusts. Occasionally, he is somewhat disingenuous when presenting his case, and this was one such occasion.

He will be aware that a series of amendments were tabled in that Committee, on Report and in the other place by my hon. Friends and me. The amendments would have made housing action trusts more open, in that they would have been the subject of a genuine ballot of the tenants and would have provided tenants with the option to revert to local authority control. The Government rejected all those amendments. We are able to say now that in certain circumstances, where there is local support, we are prepared to accept housing action trusts, because the amendments that we tabled at that time but which were rejected were ultimately accepted by the Government. All parts of the House will accept as constructive many of the comments made by the right hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Channon). What I have just said, however, about housing action trusts undermines the right hon. Gentleman's point. The right hon. Member for Aylesbury (Sir T. Raison) also made a fairly constructive and in some respects progressive speech. I refer him to the motion, in which he will find much more to agree with than he will find in the Government's amendment. The genesis of the housing crisis was during the former reign of the Secretary of State for the Environment, accompanied by the hon. Member for Acton, who, in his first incarnation as a Minister with responsibility for housing, was a member of the terrible duo that is now reinflicting itself on housing policy. The housing problems that we now face were foreshadowed by the Opposition. We warned the Government that they would eventually have to be dealt with. I refer the House to the Committee proceedings on the 1980 Housing Bill, when my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman) said: "" The Secretary of State""- the same Secretary of State as we have now- "" who has the effrontery to talk about enough new house building to meet demand, is certain to leave office with the unenviable record of having not only presided over but deliberately brought about the worst housing programme since the war.""- My hon.

The genesis of the problem is the Government's policy of the early 1980s. Nothing illustrates more clearly the Government's appeals for people to become owner-occupiers than the words of the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) at the October 1986 Conservative party conference: "" The great political reform of the last century was to enable more and more people to have a vote. Now, the great Tory reform of this century is to enable more and more people to own property."" Those words are unwelcome to all those facing homelessness and repossession, who in good faith became owner-occupiers and now find themselves unable to cope with their commitments because of the recent high interest rates. Let us not collude with any pretence that the repossession problem has not been created by the Government's relentless promotion of owner-occupation as the only housing solution. It is worth pointing out that by reducing the supply of rented accommodation, across all types of tenure, the Government have closed off many escape routes that might otherwise have been available. The facts of the problem are a stark and sorry saga. About 85,000 repossessions are officially acknowledged and, by the end of the year, it is likely to be 100,000 or even 120,000. About 750,000 owner-occupiers are in arrears and are at risk of having their property repossessed at some time in the future if they cannot resolve their problems. What is the Minister's response? One response is that of smug complacency. On "" World in Action"" earlier this week, the Minister said that most lenders are offering a range of options. He enlightened the House on those options today. Does he suppose that those 85,000 people who have already had their homes repossessed were aware of the options but simply ignored them and let themselves be put out into the street? Of course they were not aware of them and the Government have done nothing to make them aware of them. The Government's recent announcement-another panic public relations exercise with no real substance-underlines their inadequate response. First, homes will be repossessed by building societies. Secondly, the occupants will have either to fend for themselves or to fall back on the local authorities for temporary accommodation. After being repossessed by a building society or bank, their home will, through a housing association, be rented to another family who have had their home repossessed. What nonsense. It is musical houses-when the music stops, everybody changes house. It does not have the fun of musical chairs, because the game involves thousands of human tragedies. What is the politics of this? We should look at the November-December issue of Roof, in which the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) put his view succinctly: "" I have never seen such personal misery in all of my 25 years as a Member of Parliament."" Perhaps more interesting is a source quoted as a senior Conservative whip-unnamed: "" It's now clear the balance has to be redressed between home ownership and renting. There's also a continuing need for social housing which we recognise-we're not daft"". I take issue with the latter part of his remarks. The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Malins) is quoted in the same publication: "" If people borrow more than they ought to, they will have to bloody well learn."" There is plenty of sympathy there. Perhaps we should take the word of the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope): "" I haven't had a single letter on the subject. Unless I see figures which suggest otherwise, I won't believe that repossession leads to homelessness."" Those are the views of Conservative Back Benchers. They are uncharitable, unkind and disingenuous, particularly those who claim that they did not know what was happening. Several of those hon. Members are sitting on majorities of fewer than 2,000 or 5,000, and the electorate will take their revenge at the next general election. The figures for housing starts across all sections have been quoted. It is sufficient to say that new build in the private rented sector, local authorities and housing associations is on the decline. Inevitably, the gap between the supply of housing and the number of people who need it will grow and grow. The contrast is stark between what the Government are doing and the programme for a mortgage rescue package outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith. Within days of taking office, a Labour Government will call in all the interested parties-local authorities, housing associations, building societies, banks and the agencies that deal with homelessness. We shall put together a crash homelessness package and mortgage rescue package to deal with the homelessness caused by the Government's years of inactivity. The Secretary of State and his Ministers have proved time and again during their two terms of office in the Department that they are unfit to deal with housing. Only a Labour Government will deal with it, and we look forward to the day-it will be soon-when we have an opportunity to do so. I urge the House to support the motion.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,57,housing,880
1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],329,Tim Yeo,Con,False,"This has been a useful and timely debate, but not for the reasons that the Opposition intended. It has demonstrated beyond any doubt that the new thinking and well-informed contributions come from Conservative Members, while from the Opposition we hear nothing but bluster and ignorance. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Langbaurgh (Dr. Kumar) on his thoughtful maiden speech. We look forward to further contributions from him. I was interested in what he had to say. In Middlesbrough, not far from his constituency, was one of the winners of this year's city challenge initiative, with a bid that included a large housing element. The bid will tackle many of the objectives to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I hope that, as one of the 57 urban programme authorities, Langbaurgh will take the opportunity of bidding in the city challenge initiative next year, when it may receive extra funds from central Government to deal with the issues concerning the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Langbaurgh's reference to his predecessor, Richard Holt, was much appreciated by Conservative Members. I am sorry that Mr. Speaker was not here to listen to that reference, since I know that Richard Holt was a friendly adversary of Mr. Speaker. There have been some first-class speeches during this short debate. My right hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Channon), a former Minister responsible for housing, showed that he has lost none of his grasp and expertise on the subject. We welcome the support that he expressed for housing associations. He was right to stress the importance of maximising the contribution that private funds can make to supplement the contribution from the taxpayers. Last year over Â£800 million was lent from the private sector to housing associations, and this year over Â£400 million is to be lent from the same source. My hon. Friend the Minister has put in hand a study of ways in which it may be possible to increase the flow of private finance. We hope to have the results of that study early next year. I shall take note of my right hon. Friend's suggestion about total cost indicators and the frequency with which they are adjusted. I share his view about the desirability of promoting best practice among housing associations and others to minimise the rate of repossession. In painful contrast to my right hon. Friend's speech, the House heard an ignorant and rather sour contribution from the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn). The less that is said about it the better. My right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Sir T. Raison) made an eloquent plea about the shortage of affordable housing. The Government are addressing the matter urgently. We have doubled the funding of the housing association movement. I hope that my right hon. Friend's constituency and district council will receive a proper share. I should like to make two further points to my right hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury, one of which is relevant to all rural areas. Once a needs study has been conducted in a small rural village settlement, the exceptions policy allows a local authority to give permission for development on land that may have been obtained at nil cost or at a low cost that does not reflect its development value. That is one way of achieving a supply of low-cost housing in rural areas. Using the same philosophy, in May we published circular 791, which encourages local authorities to negotiate with private developers for low-cost housing to be included in new housing schemes. I want local authorities to take advantage of that huge and exciting new opportunity. There is now a chance for them to play a proper enabling role, bringing together housing and planning departments to meet local housing need. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Dr. Hampson), who attempted to intervene earlier in the debate, made an important point about the Housing Corporation's distribution of funds to housing associations. I shall write to him about that.",9991,['Opposition Day'],Housing,1,58,housing,672

The figures that are thrown around of thousands of rough sleepers are without foundation. I am glad to reiterate what my hon.

That is a huge programme, which is likely to increase this year, and its effect is precisely to achieve the objective that we all share-to prevent repossessions. The Opposition remain addicted to the solutions of the 1960s, regardless of their failure then and their irrelevance now. Their approach to the problem, and to almost every other problem, is to mouth carefully crafted phrases that are selected for their ambiguity. The purpose is to convey the message to the audience that Labour would spend more money on this or that group, but without giving a firm commitment. That blatant attempt to deceive his clients is unworthy of a former probation officer such as the hon. Member for Hammersmith. It is a new form of fraudulent misrepresentation. It can usually be heard in the House when the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) is absent. If she were here, she might have to confirm that her priorities are confined to social security issues. I wonder whether the hon.

1991-11-27,Housing [Opposition Day],337,Tim Yeo,Con,False,"That is certainly helpful clarification. I think that what the hon. Member is trying to say is that there would not be any new money. The hon. Member for Hammersmith included 16 priorities in the document that he published this year, all of which were uncosted and no order of preference was given. The mortgage rescue scheme was one of the priorities. I should like to quote from another old Labour favourite: "" the lifting of constraints on direct labour organisations"". I am not surprised that the hon. Member forgot to mention that, as today the newspapers have reported the illegal award of contracts to direct labour organisations by Lambeth borough council. That pledge will fill many tenants with absolute dread. I imagine that it was included at the request of the hon. Gentleman's cronies in the trades union movement. At least we can understand why he has not tried to put a price on it. Either way, Labour's version of the mortgage rescue scheme seems to set some new benchmark in cost-effectiveness. It is startling, even by Labour's standards. For Â£100 million, whether it is new taxpayers' money or not, not a single new unit of housing is added to existing stock. For Â£100 million, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Mr. Sayeed) pointed out, only a tiny fraction of the families who are facing repossession would receive any help. It is not the wasteful use of taxpayers' money that characterises it as a Labour proposal but the typically dominant role that the hon. Member for Hammersmith foresees for local authorities. That is the real hallmark. Whatever question one asks on housing policy, Labour's answer is always the same: give the local authorities more cash and, with any luck, they will use it to buy some more private sector homes. It is straight back to the council monopoly landlord: take away tenants' choice, drive out owner-occupiers and let the council take over. In Liverpool, that system left almost one council property in 10 empty. That system left almost a third of the rent in Lambeth uncollected, with a similar proportion in Southwark. More than Â£40 million should have been taken from tenants to repair and improve stock. Labour's vision of the future is the sink estates and unwanted tower blocks. This afternoon, Labour has tried to portray the huge expansion of owner-occupation in the past 12 years as some kind of disaster. Seven million first-time buyers since 1979 could tell Labour that they know that it is not a disaster. One and a quarter million former local authority tenants who exercised their right to buy could tell Labour that it is not a disaster. The 49 out of every 50 mortgage payers who are not in arrears or facing repossession could tell Labour that it is not a disaster. All those people know that the growth of owner-occupation has been one of the huge success stories of the 1980s. Just as we extended tenants' rights in the 1980s in the teeth of Labour party hostility, so we shall do the same in the 1990s. Whether it is tenant-led housing action trusts, rents to mortgage or large-scale voluntary transfers, tenants are enjoying new freedoms to choose their future-who their landlord is, how their estate is run and what form of tenure they should have. Just as Labour fought tooth and nail against the right to buy, so it rubbishes HATs, rent-to-mortgage schemes and large-scale voluntary transfers. In the end, Labour saw the light of day and did a U-turn on the right to buy. Who knows, after 12 more years of glorious Tory government it may be forced, by popular support for those Tory initiatives, to do U-turns on them, too. The extent of the Government's commitment can be seen in the huge resources that are being devoted to housing-not just the Â£7Â·8 billion of Department of the Environment spending but another Â£7Â·8 billion of tax relief to home buyers. That has increased two and a half times in real terms since 1979. Over the same period, spending on housing benefit has doubled in real terms to Â£4Â·6 billion. That is Â£17 billion of taxpayers' money in the form of cash and tax reliefs, in addition to the Â£1 billion of private sector lending that I have already referred to. The Government have a multi-faceted approach to housing policy. We are promoting home ownership through the right to buy, rents to mortgages and shared ownership for families that cannot afford to buy outright. We are promoting the construction of more affordable homes under circular 791, which is opening up new horizons. We are promoting a variety of rented properties in the private sector through the enormous growth in shared shorthold tenancies made possible by the Housing Act 1988, a growth which is now taking place at a faster rate than the decline in the old secure tenancies as they disappear. We are also promoting a range of other initiatives to bring back the landlord, such as the Â£25 million available for bringing back into use flats over shops. On the local authority front, through the process of competitive housing investment programme allocations we are ensuring that, for the first time, the taxpayers' resources will go where they are most likely to be well spent. That is alongside a hugely expanded estate action programme and two housing action trusts which are now getting under way. That is all in addition to the extensive initiatives outlined by my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning in response to questions about repossessions. The contrast between the two approaches is perfectly clear. Labour has a litany of uncosted promises, fraudulently financed. It is as careless with words as it is with money. Underlying its approach is a strong socialist theme-the municipalisation of private property, the crackdown on owner-occupiers and the removal of tenants' rights. We know what Labour's housing policy means in action. Unfortunately, we can see it in Lambeth, in Southwark, in Hackney and in Liverpool. It is the same old story-neglect the tenants, waste the money, run down the stock and outlaw the private sector. The Conservative philosophy is that of a pluralist approach-higher spending targeted to get even better value for money, the private landlord recreated, home owners helped more than ever before, tenants given real freedom of choice and, above all, an end to the old local authority monopoly.

1992-01-21,Housing [Clause 3],305,John Fraser,Lab,False,"This is a large group of amendments and the proposals are not all the same, so I shall break down the group. Amendments Nos. 21, 22, 23 and 24 would remove from local authorities any duty to make inquiries about whether someone was a seeker of political asylum. Of course, if a local authority in the course of its ordinary homelessness inquiries becomes aware that a person is seeking political asylum, and if the facts behind his application for that asylum-that is the circumstances under which he gave up his previous home and in which he now claims to be homeless-are similar to those made in a claim for political asylum, his application for asylum becomes relevant. However, we think that such a duty is unhealthy and we know that the local authorities do not want such a task, which is effectively a duty to ask to see people's passports and to inquire about the immigration status of those asking for housing, to be placed on the housing list or for accommodation for the homeless. There are several reasons for our approach. One is that local authorities already feel that they are overburdened with administrative problems and they are not asking for-indeed, they are resisting-these proposals. Another reason is that, once a duty has been placed on a local authority to inquire about the immigration status of an applicant, one creates distrust and bad feeling among those who will be resident in the neighbourhood, often for many years. We all know from our constituency experience that some people find it offensive to be questioned about their immigration status, especially when they were born and bred in this country, but, because of the colour of their skin or the pronunciation of their name, inquiries about their problems begin with questions about their status as immigrants rather than with the merits of their application for housing. We believe that such matters should be decided on the merits of the housing applications; that is when inquiries should begin. Investigations should not commence with examination of passports and inquiries about immigration status. Once the facts have come to the attention of the local authorities it is up to them to take decisions about how to cope with housing requirements. Some local authorities will be so hard pressed to cope with homelessness that they may well feel that they cannot assist political asylum seekers whose claims have not yet been decided. However, some local authorities have a surplus of accommodation and may find-particularly if they have empty properties-that it is cheaper to deal with applications for temporary shelter by placing claimants in permanent accommodation as that will provide a rental income. That will prove cheaper than if authorities are forced to place applicants in temporary accommodation, as the Bill seems to do. Therefore, the measure should be resisted as it is the merits of housing applications that should be considered, not the technicalities of political asylum applications. 8.30 pm Amendment No. 13 provides that, if the Home Office grants political asylum, the applicant's priority for housing relates back to when the application was first made. Under the Bill, someone could make an application to be treated as a homeless person and the application might be put on ice until the claim for political asylum status was determined. Once that has happened, as I interpret the Bill, consideration of the application will have to start again. Our amendment makes it clear that the priority of the application must relate to when the application for housing was first made, not when the Home Office or any other adjudicator made a decision about the political asylum application on appeal. Amendment Nos. 15 and 14 deal with temporary accommodation. The view, not just of Opposition Committee Members, but of almost every social housing agency, is that the way that the Bill disqualifies an application from consideration by a local authority on temporary accommodation grounds is disgraceful. It is difficult to understand how the Government could have included words in the Bill that mean that a political asylum claimant is disqualified from receiving assistance from a local authority if he or she is in housing, however temporarily. Many people have commented on the fact that, if claimants have obtained accommodation in a church hall or are sleeping in a hall, or on a settee in an overcrowded flat, they will be disqualified from consideration by the local authority because they are deemed to be in temporary accommodation. That is disgraceful, and such proposals should be removed from the Bill. Therefore, amendment No. 15 seeks to modify that obnoxious provision and would allow the political asylum applicant at least to qualify for temporary housing from the local authority when the accommodation that they are currently using is so insecure that it could disappear within 28 days of the application being made. Surely that minimum requirement should be built into the Bill. Amendment No. 14 has a similar affect to amendment No. 15. We tabled amendment No. 17 because we believe that there is no need to mix landlord and tenant law with immigration law, which is exactly what the Bill does. It states that a person cannot have a secured or assured tenancy within a specified period of an application for political asylum. Amendments Nos. 18 and 20 are comparatively minor drafting amendments. As the Bill stands, notices to applicants for political asylum do not have to be given in writing, and we propose to insert the word "" writing"". Amendment No. 19 corrects what we believe to be a drafting error. While most of this part of the Bill refers to a housing authority, the word "" housing"" has been dropped in one place. At the heart of the amendments lies the proposition that, if someone is in need of housing, a hard-pressed local authority will not generally be able initially to meet that need with permanent accommodation. The local authority may take up to one year to decide whether the applicant qualifies for priority housing under homelessness legislation. That one-year period should be roughly the same as the time within which the Home Office-if it is to act efficiently-decides on the political asylum application. There should be no conflict between the time scale of the Home Office and that of the local authority. However, if the Home Office spends-as it currently does-year after year considering applications for political asylum, and if we wish to act as a civilised country, we should not abandon a claim for accommodation for so long, which is what the Bill would do. Our proposals seek to cure that problem. It is not only the Opposition who have criticised the Bill. We recently received a brief from the National Federation of Housing Associations which provided an adequate answer to the argument made by the Minister in Committee that one purpose of the legislation was to stop political asylum claimants exercising the right to buy. As the Minister will know, those in assured tenancies have no right to buy. In other cases, secured tenants have to reside in their accommodation for at least two years before they can exercise that right. Preventing claimants from exercising such a right seems a thin reason for justifying the Bill's provisions. Housing associations and, I am sure, local authorities are reluctant to be forced into terminating tenancies and evicting people who have had applications for political asylum turned down. If applications are refused, applicants will eventually be required to leave the country. That matter should properly be left to immigration law; it should not constitute part of housing law. I hope that the Minister will realise the anxiety that the provisions have caused, not just to applicants but to those who administer social housing and council housing. I hope that, even at this late stage, the thought that lies behind the amendments, if not the amendments, will be accepted.",10262,['Clause 3'],Housing,1,3,housing,1319
1992-01-21,Housing [Clause 3],306,Paul Boateng,Lab,False,"I support this group of amendments. Central to the concept of asylum is the notion of shelter, sanctuary and refuge. We cannot hope to fulfil the spirit and letter of international conventions on refugees unless we, as a receiving nation for refugees, accept responsibility for their shelter. That is a basic requirement, not only of international law, but of common humanity. The amendments seek to mitigate clause 3, which strikes at the notion of giving shelter and respite to those driven from their homes by political upheaval. It does so in the most obnoxious way. It is discriminatory and we have yet to hear any convincing response from Conservative Members, the Department of the Environment or the Home Office to the charge laid at their doors by the Commission for Racial Equality that the clause is discriminatory in law. Also-this is important-the clause seeks to confuse the role of housing authorities and the role of those with responsibility properly to regulate immigration in this country. It gives housing officers an invidious role and means that hard-pressed local authorities which are already struggling with a range of problems have to take on responsibility for an aspect of internal immigration control. That is not good enough. It is offensive also because it puts in an intolerable position those organisations in our society that seek to meet the needs of refugees. Let me give a practical example of how the proposed law would undermine the work of the many voluntary organisations that are concerned with the refugee problem. Some time ago my own church-the Methodist church in Harlesden-took on responsibility for a number of Kurdish families who were in a crisis. The families had arrived recently and dreaded homelessness. Harlesden Methodist church is not rich, and it is in a deprived area of London, yet it took on responsibility for those Kurds. What will happen when people housed in Church premises or temporarily in the homes of local church people apply to a local authority? Under this legislation as drafted, they will fall foul of the law. It is worth looking in detail at the wording of clause 3, under which such people cannot be deemed to be homeless because accommodation, however temporary, is available to them. I should like the Minister to be able to tell me that my interpretation of clause 3 is wrong, that refugees such as those that the Harlesden Methodist church could not possibly house indefinitely would not, under this legislation, lose their right to local authority housing. The view that I am expressing is that not just of the Opposition but also of the Housing Law Practitioners' Association, the Law Society and the Children's Legal Centre-professional bodies that deal with housing issues day in and day out. Their reading of the legislation as drafted is that such persons would lose the right to local authority housing. In the sort of society that we hold this one to be, that cannot be right. There is a question that this House will have to address in all seriousness: in those circumstances, what is the moral distinction between our treatment of Kurdish refugees-this being a relatively prosperous, secure and stable society-and the Turkish Government's treatment of the Kurds whom they allow to rot on their mountainsides? It is quite clear that there is a distinction in terms of scale, but what is the moral distinction? We could do better, and we ought to do better. All that these amendments seek to achieve is a situation in which applicants for refugee status are treated in the same way as all other applicants for housing. That is all that is asked. We are not asking that such people be given special treatment or any advantage. What is particularly offensive about this clause in an abhorrent piece of legislation is that it is so blatantly discriminatory, so blatantly unequal. It seeks to achieve a purpose of which we ought to be ashamed. It seeks to make life that much more unpleasant for refugees in this country. It seeks to make life that much more intolerable for them as a group, presumably for the purpose-and it is a squalid and shameful purpose-of deterring people from fleeing to this country. That is the only interpretation that any objective reader can put on this legislation, and it is one that, for the sake of this House and of the nation, we must address. Over many years, this country has established a tradition of receiving refugees, and, in general, we do not have much to apologise for. The tradition has been a bit battered and skimping of late, but it is still markedly better than that of many other countries. Even at this late stage, we must seek to avoid undermining it as fundamentally as this legislation would do. By the blanket way in which, in terms of housing, it treats applicants for refugee status, it puts us in danger of breaching our international treaty obligations under article 19(4)(c) of the Council of Europe social charter and of convention No. 97 of the International Labour Organisation. The Bill would put us in danger of breaching those provisions of international law.",10262,['Clause 3'],Housing,1,4,housing,863

Particularly obnoxious is clause 3, to which these amendments relate. The introduction of this provision marks the first occasion since the introduction of legislation on homelessness on which a particular group of people has been singled out for the application of a lower level of rights than is enjoyed by anyone else in the country. It treats all asylum seekers as a guilty group. It requires them to prove their innocence before they can have a roof over their heads. The same thing applies to the regulations that accompany the Bill. They too treat these people as guilty by providing that, immediately on entry to the country, they may, against their will, be held in a detention centre and fingerprinted. To my mind, the Minister has not allayed our misgivings about fingerprinting. I wish to underline the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South. Housing should have no place in the Bill. There is no need for clause 3. People awaiting a decision on whether they are to be classified as genuine asylum seekers should enjoy the same rights as anyone without a roof over his head who presents himself to a local authority as homeless. A whole raft of organisations have made just that point to the Home Secretary, but apparently to no avail. I am talking about a group of highly respected organisations-Shelter, the Shelter Housing Aid Committee, the London Housing Aid Group, the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux, the Law Society, the National Federation of Housing Associations, the British Refugee Council, and so on. Those organisations are experienced campaigners in such matters and at looking after people who find themselves in the near-impossible position of not having a home, yet their opinions have been ignored, as have those of the Commission for Racial Equality, which has stated unequivocally that it believes clause 3 to be racially discriminatory and "" in direct conflict with all existing statutory guidance on the homeless and race relations legislation."" Coming from a Government-funded body, that is a serious charge, but it has been quite simply denied by the Government with the brush of a hand. The Government's position has not been explained or defended. No one is convinced. The Government need not think that they are off the hook. If the Bill becomes law, a number of organisations-not least the Commission for Racial Equality-will continue to do their job and expose its pernicious nature. A thinly disguised vein of racism runs right through the Bill. It is a bit like a stick of Blackpool rock in that respect. Throughout the Bill, interspersed with apparently reasonable propositions are entirely unreasonable and racially motivated proposals. In the case of clause 3, the racial aspect is not even thinly disguised. Throughout the Bill, the Government's assumption is that most, if not all, asylum seekers are really economic refugees-people with little to fear, who simply want to find a better standard of living in this country than exists in their own. For generations, many of my fellow Scots have chosen to emigrate to Canada, Australia or New Zealand in search of a better standard of living. The Government tend to view asylum seekers in similar terms, but the parallel is a fallacy. If any proof were needed, the Government's own figures assist in demolishing the argument. Since 1980, 83 per cent. of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom have come from nine countries-Ethiopia, Ghana, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Poland, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Uganda. It will not have escaped the attention of the House that all those countries have a recent history of political oppression or civil war. That is no coincidence, and it renders it even less likely-if it was ever likely-that people from those countries simply fancy a better standard of living and so present themselves on our doorstep. That fallacy is undermined again by a Home Office paper produced in June 1990, listing those countries or territorial entities whose nationals or citizens need visas for the United Kingdom. Of a total of 77 countries, only seven are countries where the population is predominantly white. They are Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union. Since the list was issued, Uganda and Jamaica have been added. The import of that is perfectly clear. Even if the Government could convince us that the intent of that list published by the Home Office was not racist-I maintain that they have failed to do so-they cannot escape culpability, because the effect of the legislation is racist. The same is true of clause 3 of the present Bill. The amendment would rid the Bill of what I believe to be a major block, and would at the same time ensure that parity of housing treatment was afforded to asylum seekers. There is no reason why they should not enjoy that right. The Government should accept the amendments outlined in detail by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser), first, to ensure that the current situation under the homelessness legislation-whereby applications from asylum seekers and other homeless applicants are treated equally-was maintained. That has been the position until now, and there is no reason why it should not continue to be the position. That should apply even before the Home Office decision on refugee status has been made. When asylum seekers have crossed that hurdle, they find another immediately facing them. They continue to face discrimination, being required to wait 12 months before enjoying a secure assured tenancy in the way that other homeless applicants do when they are granted accommodation. Surely that cannot be justified, and the Under-Secretary should have the good sense and good grace to admit it when he answers the debate. Finally, local authorities should have the freedom to assess homeless applicants on the basis of housing need alone. That is the thrust of the legislation introduced as a result of great need throughout the country. Under the Bill as drafted, however, housing authorities will be forced to make the decision on the basis of having sought clearance from the Home Office on the status of the claimant. Surely, unless the claimant actually chooses to disclose the fact that he is seeking asylum, there is absolutely no need for that information to be passed to the housing authority attempting to house that person. If the Government fail to accept the amendments, they will continue to stand accused, and rightly so, of introducing a Bill which, at best, is discriminatory and, at worst, racist. I repeat that clause 3 is completely unnecessary and will not even assist in achieving what the Government claim to intend. The amendments represent an attempt to rid the Bill of some of its most pernicious provisions. If the Under-Secretary refuses to accept them, he will be sending a clear and, I say, shameful message to the rest of the world about the status of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom.",10262,['Clause 3'],Housing,1,9,housing,1183
1992-01-21,Housing [Clause 3],312,Jeremy Corbyn,Lab,False,"I fully endorse the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Watson) and for Norwood (Mr. Fraser). Having sat through much discussion of the matter in Committee, I think that this is a shabby and nasty clause. If the homeless persons legislation can be altered in this underhand manner, what will happen next? If the Bill goes through in its present form and asylum seekers are no longer entitled to permanent housing, it will overturn the principle of the homeless persons legislation, dating from 1977, which was the principle of universal access to housing for those in housing need. The Bill will defeat and weaken that principle. What might the next stage be? I do not know what goes on in the minds of those who draft Bills such as this, which further restrict the right to public sector housing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood said, when asylum seekers arrive, they are admitted and their case is then processed. I know from experience that processing can take several years. Some of the cases with which I am dealing have been with the Home Office for many years-five years or more-yet clause 3 provides that asylum seekers can be housed only in temporary accommodation by local authorities. In my local authority area, if they are lucky, "" temporary housing"" means a property that the council has leased, usually for six months to a year at a time, so each six months to a year that family would have to move. I said, "" if they are lucky"" because that tends to involve a fairly reasonable standard of accommodation. If they are unlucky, it means hostel accommodation or bed and breakfast. Who exactly is the Bill designed to punish? Has the Minister ever seen children growing up in bed-and-breakfast hotels? Has he seen the signs of depression among parents trying to keep a family together in a bed-and-breakfast room, looking every day at the same washstand, wondering whether breakfast would be any different that day from any other day, the lack of play space, the family rows that develop, and the enormous cost as well? The clause does not actually save any money-it costs a great deal more to local authorities. One wonders what the motive behind the Bill is, other than, as my hon. Friends have pointed out, the punishment of asylum seekers who wish to obtain housing, having been admitted into this country. In Committee, there was a fairly unusual set of circumstances in which hon. Members raised points of order about the way in which the clause contravened the Race Relations Act 1976. When it was pointed out that it appeared to be in contravention and that the Commission for Racial Equality, a statutory body, issued a statement to that effect, Law Officers were eventually unwillingly brought along to the Committee and forced to try to defend the position. They did not make a very good job of it. The CRE was established under the Race Relations Act 1976 specifically to attack discrimination in this country, be it by an employer who refuses to employ black people or an institution that operates policies that systematically discriminate against a certain group of people. The Government are now adopting a policy in law which systematically discriminates against those who are seeking political asylum. I shall not repeat the facts that were given by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central in his excellent contribution, but he pointed out where most asylum seekers come from. 9 pm What is to be the future relationship between local authorities, the Home Office and the immigration service? Were people appointed to work in local authority housing departments to be agents on which the Home Office could rely? A housing officer in a local authority, when interviewing a housing applicant, must ask whether he or she is an asylum seeker. A housing officer will not know, when a family walks through a door, whether they are asylum seekers. They will be seen as a family. Any black family who seek assistance from the local authority housing department will be asked to produce a passport or a form of identity so that a check can be made within the Home Office. There will be a system of passport checks or identity checks for non-white applicants or foreign applicants. That is how it will work. What does the Minister think that that will do to the relationship between local authority housing departments and those who require housing? Local authority associations have pointed out the increased costs that the Bill puts on them. For authorities that actually have a surplus of or ready access to permanent housing, it is much more expensive to keep families in temporary accommodation than in permanent accommodation. But there is a moral case as well. The morality behind the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 was that society had a moral obligation to ensure that everyone in need-for example, those with dependent children, the elderly, or those at some risk-had a right to be housed. That Act represented an important step forward. This legislation, particularly coming from the Government's hand, is the start of the erosion of that principle. Does the Minister honestly think that that is a fair, moral and just way of administering a housing policy or treating people who have come here to seek political asylum? I invite him to meet asylum applicants. They are not living very well; they fear being returned, and they are concerned about what has happened to their families. I deal with many asylum applicants. One sees the fear on the faces of those people. They know that their families are at risk in Somalia, Zaire, Uganda or wherever they have attempted to come from. They know that they may never see them again-obviously, they hope that they will. They know that they will be treated as second-class citizens. They receive 90 per cent. of income support instead of 100 per cent., again for no good reason other than as a form of punishment, and temporary housing, again for no good reason other than as a form of punishment. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South and I hope that, even at this late hour, the Minister will be prepared to reconsider, in the light of all the representations, the strength of feeling and the declaration by the Commission for Racial Equality that clause 3 is wholly wrong, wholly misguided, immoral, and should be withdrawn.",10262,['Clause 3'],Housing,1,10,housing,1095

1992-01-21,Housing [Clause 3],318,Tim Yeo,Con,False,"I am going to have some say in this debate. Brent council had more uncollected rent than any other local authority in the whole of England and Wales-this was during the last year that it was under Labour control. I have no doubt that if it remains under Tory control long enough the figures will improve-they could hardly get worse. Forty-four per cent. of the rent-Â£15 million-was uncollected. So we need not take lessons from the hon. Member for Brent, South when we see what his Labour colleagues on that council did when in charge of the housing resources there. I do not yield to the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) one iota in my anxiety to get people out of unsatisfactory temporary accommodation, particularly bed-and-breakfast accommodation. I share his concern. It is precisely because I do that I find it deplorable that we have so many Labour-controlled local authorities with huge numbers of empty properties. There are more local authority properties in this country that have been empty for more than 12 months than there are families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. One way of helping to limit the extent to which people are placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation is to ensure that those who have access to permanent accommodation in this country are people who have also established a permanent right to remain here. Under the current homelessness legislation asylum seekers can qualify for permanent housing from a local authority if they meet the same tests as anyone else-that is if they are unintentionally homeless, or threatened with homelessness and in priority need. In general, this means families with children, pregnant women or those vulnerable for some other reason. In my view, and in the view of many other people, it is illogical that someone whose right to remain in the country permanently is still under question and has not been established can secure permanent accommodation in that way. Current estimates are that up to 5,000 asylum-seeker families are likely to qualify for housing help under the homelessness legislation in this year alone. However, the absolute numbers, while disturbing, are not the overriding problem. The real problem is that those asylum seekers impose a disproportionate burden on certain local authorities, particularly in London, because asylum seekers tend to concentrate either at the point of arrival or in areas where there is a refugee community already established. Some local authorities are having to accept a duty to secure housing for 250 or more asylum-seeker households a year. That exacerbates existing housing pressures and means that local people on waiting lists will have an even longer wait for permanent housing. Under our measures we propose two extra tests for asylum seekers who are waiting for their asylum applications to be decided. First, do they have reasonable accommodation at the moment, even if it is only temporary? Secondly, is there any other accommodation they could reasonably go to? The Bill provides that, if they meet all these tests, the local authority has to provide only temporary accommodation until the asylum application is decided. It will be up to the local authority to decide how to fulfil its duty to provide temporary accommodation, which might be a short-term tenancy in its permanent stock. I should like to correct a recurring misconception that has been repeated this evening by the hon. Members for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) and for Islington, North-that requiring an authority to provide only temporary accommodation to an asylum seeker does not mean that that asylum seeker must be placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. As a matter of fact, it does not mean even that the local authority has to put such a person in temporary accommodation. The local authority has discretion, which it can use, to put that person in permanent accommodation if it so wishes. If it desires-",10262,['Clause 3'],Housing,1,16,housing,637

The intention is to make it clear to a local authority that it has no duty further than the provision of temporary accommodation to an applicant for housing who is an asylum seeker. It has discretion to go further than that, but no duty to do so. If the wording to which my right hon.

1992-01-21,Housing [Clause 3],324,Tim Yeo,Con,False,"No. The answer is the same. The Bill is designed to make clear the local authority's statutory obligation. It is, as I have said, to provide temporary accommodation. If the local authority, in its own discretion, chooses to go further than that, it will be free to do so. This is just setting out what the minimum provision by the local authority has to be in order to satisfy its statutory responsibilities. I return to the misconception, which was repeated by the hon. Members for Norwood and for Islington, North, that temporary accommodation means bed and breakfast. I was very glad to have the acknowledgement of several Opposition Members that there are local authorities with a surplus of accommodation; they do not always acknowledge that quite so readily. Unfortunately, in practice, not many of the areas with large numbers of asylum seekers coincide with areas where there are surpluses. Nevertheless, it is nice to have the recognition that they sometimes do. Those local authorities are perfectly free to allocate their housing, which would be an ordinary council house or flat, to an asylum seeker on a temporary tenancy. So there is no question of an authority which has a surplus in its own stock having to send asylum seeker applicants to bed-and-breakfast accommodation; it will of course use the stock that is available to it. That is a misconception that we heard in the Standing Committee and have heard again this evening, and I am glad to have an opportunity to make it clear that a local authority will fulfil its duty by providing accommodation which could be a short-term tenancy in its permanent stock. The local authority could also arrange a tenancy in the private sector. It could be in a hostel, or, in those areas where no alternative could be found, it could be in bed and breakfast. But it does not have to be if there are alternatives, and I believe that all hon. Members will agree that it is preferable to avoid bed-and-breakfast accommodation if possible. If asylum seekers are subsequently recognised as refugees or otherwise granted leave to remain in the country, they will have the same rights under the homelessness legislation as anyone else. If they are refused leave to remain in the country, they will not have rights under that legislation. Amendments 21, 22 and 23 seek to deny the housing authority the opportunity to inquire of an applicant under the homelessness legislation whether he is an asylum seeker and say that instead it should rely on the asylum seeker to volunteer the information. Given that under the proposals in this legislation the local authority will have a different duty under the homelessness legislation to an applicant who is an asylum seeker as compared with any other applicant, it is imperative that a housing authority, in order to carry out its duty, be able to establish whether an applicant is an asylum seeker. It would be unreasonable not to allow an authority to ask an applicant whether he was an asylum seeker. The lack of this ability might result in an asylum seeker who had not revealed his status to the local authority being provided with permanent accommodation to which he was not entitled. The hon. Member for Norwood expressed great concern about the fact that these decisions would be made on the merits of housing issues. Let me say again that one of the factors which determine the merits of a housing application will be whether the applicant is an asylum seeker. The Bill will make it simple for the authority to establish whether an applicant is an asylum seeker by applying to the Home Office for information, which the Home Office will have a duty to supply. This will assist authorities in establishing the facts. Perhaps I had better deal with the confidentiality point when we discuss how the information will be obtained and whether it is in writing or otherwise. But we have already touched in Committee on the safeguards which we intend to put in place to ensure confidentiality of information. Amendment No. 24 illustrates the absurdity of the proposals on identifying asylum seekers. Paragraph 4 of schedule 1 provides that anyone who gives false information, or withholds information about whether a homelessness applicant is an asylum seeker, with the intention of misleading the authority is committing an offence. The amendment seeks to limit the circumstances in which an offence is created to a case where the applicant, or indeed any other person, tells the authority that the applicant is an asylum seeker when he or she is not. It would no longer be an offence for the homeless applicant to deny that he or she was an asylum seeker when that was the case. That is clearly absurd. It is hard to think of any circumstances in which an applicant for help under the homelessness legislation would say that he was an asylum seeker when he was not. It is equally absurd that an asylum seeker should be able to lie about his status with no fear of prosecution. Amendment No. 13 seeks to make ineffective our proposal that the local authority should have the opportunity to reconsider a homelessness application when the asylum seeker is granted leave to remain in this country. The principle behind clause 3 is that it is reasonable to distinguish under the homelessness legislation between an asylum seeker who has only a temporary right to remain in the country and someone who has a right to live here permanently. Under our proposals an asylum seeker who is homeless and in priority need will have a right only to temporary accommodation until the asylum application is determined. Subsection (4) provides that in the case of a successful asylum seeker a new application under the homelessness legislation is deemed to have been made immediately before the asylum case was determined. That gives the local authority the opportunity to consider whether the former asylum seeker is still in priority need and thereby qualifies for help under the homelessness legislation.",10262,['Clause 3'],Housing,1,22,housing,1013

It is for exactly that reason that the provision is included. It is because we are concerned, as the hon. Member for Norwood said he was, with the merits of the housing case that we want to make sure that when someone's asylum application has been determined and has been successful we have another look at the circumstances.

It is by no means hypothetical; I have constituency cases of women who have come to this country as refugees from Somalia and who have subsequently lost children. Such women suffer the trauma of being a refugee, followed by the trauma of loss of child, followed by the trauma of enforced loss of accommodation. In those circumstances, it is not as if the local authority would have discretion. The duty to house would have ended. In those circumstances, the woman would be dispossessed. Does not that give the Minister cause for concern?",10262,['Clause 3'],Housing,1,25,housing,105
1992-01-21,Housing [Clause 3],328,Tim Yeo,Con,False,"The hon. Gentleman is wrong on two counts. The authority would still have discretion. An authority is at liberty to house people whether they are in priority need or not. It is merely that the duty of the authority to do so would have ended, but the authority would retain the discretion to continue to provide housing. Nothing in the Bill affects that discretion. The Bill merely removes any duty to house an asylum seeker who is not in priority need, and it removes the duty to provide permanent accommodation for someone while that person is an asylum seeker. The hon. Gentleman is also wrong because it is possible for someone still to be in priority need even if there are no dependent children, depending on the position of stress in which the individual finds himself. That is already part of the homelessness legislation. On both grounds there could be circumstances in which a woman who had lost a child-depending on the precise facts-could still be classified as being in priority need. Even if that were not so, the local authority would still retain discretion, if it chose to use it, to provide housing. The logic of the deemed reapplication is overwhelming. The fact remains also that a successful asylum seeker who remains in priority need has nothing to fear from the process of a deemed reapplication being made at the time when the status of the asylum seeker in this country has been determined. Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 raise two distinct issues that we spent some time debating in Committee. The first issue is whether the House considers it reasonable that a local authority should be able to take into account, in deciding whether an asylum seeker is homeless, not only whether he or she is currently occupying reasonable accommodation but whether there is some alternative accommodation-perhaps with family or friends-to which he or she might reasonably go before turning to the local authority. I believe that the majority of hon. Members agree with that entirely reasonable proposition. The majority of asylum seekers-three out of four-are already in this country at the time of making their application. In all probability, therefore, they will have established local contacts that are sufficient to help them find alternative accommodation. We are not saying that an asylum seeker who arrives at Heathrow will be required by the local authority to seek alternative accommodation, regardless of expense or practicality. He or she will not have to search for accommodation across the country. The test is governed by what is reasonable. Local authorities will have discretion, which they are already used to applying in relation to the homelessness legislation. Ultimately it would be a matter for the courts to decide. The second issue that is raised by amendments Nos. 14 and 15 is when an asylum seeker might be regarded as threatened with homelessness. As the hon. Member for Norwood said, this is an issue about which various outside bodies have expressed concern. I shall outline how the threatened-with-homelessness provisions currently apply in the homelessness legislation and how they will apply to asylum seekers under the proposals in the Bill. Under the 1985 legislation, a person is threatened with homelessness if he or she is likely to become homeless within 28 days. In that event, the local authority is obliged to consider the homelessness application in the usual way. If it is satisfied that the applicant is likely to become homeless unintentionally and is in a priority need group, it must take reasonable steps to ensure that that accommodation does not cease to be available for his or her occupation. That could mean assisting the applicant in such a way that he can stay on where he is, or it could mean that once the person has become homeless at the end of the period, there is alternative accommodation available for his occupation. The hon. Member for Brent, South raised the case of the Kurdish refugees who were housed by the Harlesden Methodists. The position is clear. If the period available to the refugees were less than 28 days, they could establish that they were in priority need. Existing legislation does not mean-this is what Opposition Members are seeking to achieve for asylum seekers by means of the amendments-that the housing authority has a duty to secure alternative accommodation the moment that the threat of homelessness within 28 days has been identified. It would be a waste of resources to adopt that approach if accommodation were still available for another four weeks. It is more sensible for a local authority to take on the responsibility at the end of the period that is currently available. In Committee, I undertook to check that the provisions of the 1985 Act applying to people threatened with homelessness apply equally to asylum seekers under the Bill's proposals. They do nothing to affect the continuing application of the relevant provisions of the 1985 Act that are not explicitly modified by our new proposals. Hon. Members expressed concern on behalf of voluntary bodies about our proposals, but the Bill does not present any disincentive to voluntary organisations to continue making provisions. 9.30 pm Amendment No. 17 seeks to alter the provisions in the Bill relating to security of tenure. The Bill provides that, in the case of an asylum seeker, the right to a secure local authority tenancy or a housing authority or private assured tenancy does not arise until 12 months after notification to the landlord by the Secretary of State for the Home Department that the applicant has ceased to be an asylum seeker-though the landlord's discretion remains. As I said before, it is illogical that someone should be able to obtain a secure or assured tenancy until their right to remain in this country has been permanently established. Amendments Nos. 18, 19, and 20 deal with safeguards against unauthorised disclosure of information about an asylum seeker, which was debated in Committee at some length. We are of course anxious to preserve the confidentiality of information obtained from the Home Office, and I have made arrangements with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department to ensure that the normal mode of communicating between the housing authority will be in writing. I am satisfied that there is no need to include that provision in the Bill. We will make administrative arrangements, but as I gain the impression from Opposition Members that they want to conclude the debate- -I will be happy to explain them in writing. Amendment No. 19 seeks to clarify that the Secretary of State may pass on information about an asylum seeker only to a housing authority. I am happy to accept that amendment to ensure that the position is made clear in the Bill. Amendment No. 20 seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State notifies both the housing authority and the applicant in writing of the outcome of the application for asylum. We believe that that is unnecessary, because paragraph 6(3) of schedule 1 already makes that clear. I therefore urge the House to accept amendment No. 19 but to reject the others.",10262,['Clause 3'],Housing,1,26,housing,1193

It is perhaps a pity that such an important debate on matters relating to housing has been delayed due to the farce that we have just seen. If the Government had got their act together, we would have had another 45 minutes to deal with this very important subject. It is easy to fall into the trap of suggesting that problems in one's own constituency are unique. I had no idea of the scale of the housing crisis facing this country outside my area of the north-west of England until I compared notes with my colleagues. If we want to begin to tackle the problems, we do not need the Government's laid back approach of "" It'll be all right on the night""; we need radical action from the Government. I will refer in detail to my constituency to give the House a flavour of the problems in one constituency which is by no means the worst off in the land, but by no means the best off. My constituency comprises part of the borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston and part of the council area of the city of Chester. Some 10,000 electors live in the latter part. There are 4,500 people on the housing waiting list in the borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston and 5,000 in the city of Chester area. I want to examine the facts in some detail and I hope that that will demonstrate to the House that the problem lies not with local authorities, private landlords, housing associations or the owner-occupied sector, but right here with the Government. The problem is their failure to recognise the importance of the links between the breakdown in the economy generally and the growing crisis in housing. In the rural Chester area, the council has undertaken a major survey to determine the extent of rural housing need. The results of two pilot surveys show an under-estimation of need in respect of the housing waiting list. There is a substantial level of requests for rented accommodation in preference to owner-occupation. In its 1992 report, the Rural Development Commission highlighted the problems and cited Chester as a case study. The report refers to the low average wage of often less than Â£3 an hour-against a background of the Government wanting to abolish the wages councils-and the average private rent of Â£63 a week. The report also refers to other difficulties in respect of trying to resolve the problem in rural areas. Thirty seven per cent. of Chester's rural council housing stock has been sold off. With a rural turnover of 6 per cent., which is substantially less than the urban area, there is a real problem. Since April 1989, there has been a 25 per cent. increase in the housing waiting list in the borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston, from 3,276 to 4,492. As bad as that figure is, it hides the real problem which is the time that people have to wait in order to be housed. I will refer to harsh statistics to illustrate my points and I ask hon. Members, many of whom on the Conservative Benches live in relative opulence, to think carefully about what the figures mean. With regard to the increase in the housing waiting list from 3,276 to 4,492, in April 1987, a family with one child had to wait just one month in Ellesmere Port and Neston on average to obtain council accommodation. That reflects a well-run Labour-controlled authority of which there are many up and down the land. Regrettably, as a result of the Government's policies, that waiting time has increased to 42 months-",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,1,housing,729

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],234,Andrew Miller,Lab,False,"The Government Whip may criticise that point from a sedentary position, but I challenge anyone to criticise the authority which has managed its housing stock extremely well. The Government are responsible for the increase in waiting time to 42 months. The main contributory factors to the increase in waiting lists are constraints on new build, the effects of the poll tax, stress related to family breakdown, unemployment and repossessions. After.14 years of Tory trial and error, one would have thought that the Tories would have got it right; but no, the problems continue. It is the public's trial based on Tory errors. In this month's House Builder magazine, the Chancellor of the Exchequer displays an awe-inspiring ignorance. Under the headline, which I found difficult to believe,"" The Government's done its bit"", the Chancellor argues that the housing market can look after itself after his autumn statement. What complacent drivel. Having set out what is so obviously a flawed argument, he concludes: "" the Government cannot underwrite the housing market; nor can it insulate the building and construction trades from the economic cycle."" When the Prime Minister eventually realises that the Chancellor just is not up to the job, I suggest that he looks at the cartoon linked to that article in which the Chancellor is pointing to building workers saying, "" Gentlemen, over to you."" Yes, any one of them could do a better job than the present incumbent. Any one of them could demonstrate the clear links between the state of the economy and the construction industry. Any one of them could tell the Chancellor that his autumn statement was just a drop in the ocean. Any one of them would have more concern for the needs of the homeless and people living in inadequate accommodation than the Chancellor.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,3,housing,300

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],236,Andrew Miller,Lab,False,"The hon. Gentleman is somewhat premature: that has not happened. If he waits a little longer, he will hear my economic analysis and I hope that he will then appreciate that the scale of the problem is much greater than has been suggested. If the Chancellor spent less time evicting his own tenants and more time thinking about the nation's economic plight, perhaps he would really start to understand what is happening. In the House Builder, under the byline "" Absent jury"", the president of the House-Builders Federation, Mr. Tony Hillier, states: "" Clearly, the economy dominates all. The slump in the housing market is inextricably linked to the continued failure of the general economy to move out of recession. The jury is still out on whether the Chancellor's Autumn Statement was sufficient to stimulate the economy into decisive action. The Government clearly does not believe that a recovery in housing is a pre-condition for recovery in the wider economy, and we at the HBF have suspended judgment to see who is right."" People at the HBF obviously believe one thing and the Government believe another. He went on to say: "" When I took chemistry 'A' level, many years ago, I grappled with molecular theory""- I was attracted by that statement, because I grappled with molecular theory as well- "" which taught me that life was made up of various sub-atomic particles-protons, electrons and neutrons. In my journey through life I have since discovered a further particle, which seems to be the main building block of life: that is, of course, the moron. It seems to me that it is this particular particle which generates much of the housing policy of the DOE and other Government departments."" I could not put it better myself. Mr. Hillier's knighthood obviously goes down the Swanee. My staff have been talking to local estate agents. I thank the estate agents who took part in my little survey. It was particularly important because it was an attempt to put into perspective some parts of the problem that we face. I shall describe to the House some of the anecdotal comments that came from estate agents. The first said: "" Not wonderful-not very good at all!"" She said that things picked up after the new year but fell again and that if interest rates stayed down they would improve. According to that estate agent, it is basically supply and demand. She has many properties on her books without chains but they are not moving either. Property prices are down by 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. in the past two years. The second estate agent said: "" There are positive signs of improvement this year, busier than last year."" Although there are more properties on the market, they are not selling any more. Lots of people appear to be waiting for interest rates to fall again. When the market picks up and house prices are realistic, they should sell. Another estate agent said that last year was the worst year on record. Prices dropped by 10 per cent. That estate agent was a little more encouraged by the beginning of 1993, but he said that that "" could be wiped out by a rise in interest rates and local employment setbacks."" The importance of that for the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Gedling) is that, according to the estate agents to whom I have spoken, there are direct links between the general economic situation and the needs of the housing industry. Another estate agent said that redundancy worries and possible job loss are more important than keeping the brake on interest rates. The general links are clearly seen by estate agents. As the House can see, estate agents' views are not all necessarily bleak in respect of the owner-occupied sector. But, even if one were to take the most optimistic of those comments, unless the supply side is addressed in terms of the low-cost end of the market, there can be no solution. We simply have too few houses to meet the nation's need for housing of a decent standard. Add to that the problems of negative equity and the problems in the private sector start to become even more clear. Negative equity more than doubled last year to Â£2Â·68 billion. Also, 27 per cent. of people buying the cheapest property have negative equity. If this year's fall in house prices continues, by the end of the year negative equity will double. A resolution of the issue of confidence raised by the agents to whom I referred will occur only when the economy gets back on the move. Of course, most people bar the Chancellor think that a house-building programme that targets the low-cost sector would have an early impact on confidence. In turn, that would provide an incentive to the marketplace and take pressure off local authorities by increasing interest elsewhere in the spectrum, and remove or at least reduce the number of repossessions. In turn, the chain reaction would release precious resources which could be used to address many other pressing social problems. The formula is quite straightforward and simple. Examples of how the system has gone wrong can be seen throughout the country. The Minister for Housing and Planning recently suggested that mandatory renovation grants might be abandoned entirely due to the financial pressures that they are placing on local authorities. Although financial pressures on councils are undoubtedly increasing, such a step would be extremely short-sighted. It would accelerate deterioration of the housing stock, affect the most vulnerable groups in society and reduce the supply of housing. As hon. Members know, housing capital finance is an extremely complex subject. Capital expenditure can be derived from three sources: first, permission to borrow money; secondly, housing capital receipts; and, thirdly, rent income. The Government issue a basic credit approval which covers all council activity, not just housing. However, they do that in stages to make it appear that capital allocation is being made specifically for housing. The first stage is the announcement of the housing investment programme allocation. That in itself does not confer permission to borrow, but it is the Government's assessment of what a council needs to spend on its capital works. I shall set out in careful detail the next part of my argument because it shows the anomaly between the way the Government manipulate the figures and the real facts facing local authorities. In the case of my local authority, the "" receipts taken into account"" figure significantly increased in 1993-94. That represents central Government's assessment of the council's ability to finance capital expenditure from usable capital receipts. The figure is based on actual usable capital receipts as at 31 March 1992, plus an estimate of the likely usable receipts that will be generated in 1992-93. However, the latter figure is modified as though the relaxation on capital receipts rules that was announced in the Chancellor's autumn statement had applied from 1 April, which of course it did not. For Ellesmere Port and Neston, matters have been made worse by the fact that the council received a one-off windfall capital receipt of more than Â£3 million before 13 November 1992. Therefore, although it was able to use only 50 per cent. of that money, the Government treated it as 100 per cent. usable. That was a general fund capital receipt, not a housing capital receipt. Moreover, the Government have made the assumption that that represents the typical usable capital receipts during the year and therefore the figure has been projected to 1993-94. The effects of that perverse methodology in calculating receipts taken into account is that in 1993-94 the housing capital programme will lose credit approvals amounting to Â£793,000, which actually relates to general fund capital receipts, half of which the council is not allowed to use anyway. By comparison, it is estimated that additional usable housing capital receipts released as a result of the Chancellor's autumn statement are Â£280,000 in 1992-93 and Â£572,250 in 1993-94. Against that, the amount of set-aside capital receipts-the amount of capital receipts which the council owns but is not allowed to spend-is approximately Â£11Â·5 million. That logic is perverse and must be changed.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,5,housing,1370
1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],237,Nick Raynsford,Lab,False,My hon. Friend rightly highlighted the perverse logic of the Government in their attitude to capital receipts. Is my hon. Friend aware of the even more perverse position of the Minister of Housing ten years ago-he was a junior housing Minister at that time-when he was advocating the use of all accumulated capital receipts as absolutely essential for the housing programme? That is an extraordinary inconsistency on the part of the Government who now claim that they cannot release the Â£5 billion which is available and would make such an enormous difference in meeting housing needs.,12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,6,housing,96
1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],238,Andrew Miller,Lab,False,"I bow to my hon. Friend's knowledge and expertise in the field of housing. I agree with him wholeheartedly that not only my small detailed example but the whole logic of the Government's position is perverse. This morning, I received a letter from the Maritime Housing Association which set out the difficulties that the association faces. Maritime housing is an area supposedly being helped by the current Administration. The association wrote to me on behalf of all members of the committee of management to express concern about the level of average housing association grants for rental schemes which is projected for 1994-95 and 1995-96. A small housing association is expressing that view. It has written to all Members of Parliament in the greater Merseyside area. I hope that the Minister will take on board the points which have been made. We face serious issues. The House Builder is not a left-wing tract as far as I am aware. In that magazine, the Minister for Housing and Planning takes a marginally more enlightened view on which I congratulate him. He says, "" There can be no doubt that the issues surrounding Housing are among the most important facing us today."" When I first read that statement I thought that the Minister had seen the light and was on his way to Damascus. He continued by saying- He does not know where the article is, either. He continued by saying, and I think that it is a quote from the Department of the Environment's annual report: "" The Government's aim is to ensure that a decent home is within the reach of every family whether it is owned by them, rented from private or social landlords or part owned and part rented."" He then goes on to promote a series of solutions, some of which I would go along with. However, the problem is his failure to distance himself from that wretched Chancellor and recognise the scale of the problem facing the country. He said that his package is "" to provide a kick start""- Labour Members were criticised for using "" kick start"" during the election- "" to the depressed housing market, while at the same time providing some additional 20,000 social homes this year."" I have to say to the Minister that that simply is not enough. His logic and financial methodology are suspect in the extreme. Earlier, I accused the Minister of underestimating the scale. Why did he do that? He did it simply because, with all the expertise at his fingertips, he is satisfied with a target figure of 20,000. The Institute of Housing says that the target should be 100,000. Shelter agrees with that view, as do the Housing Corporation and that other well-known left-wing think tank, the Audit Commission. In considering action for the Budget, the Chancellor would do well to examine the arguments of the Institute of Housing. The institute says, "" House building is one of the most effective ways to create new employment because it is labour intensive. Every Â£1 million invested in new houses or renovation creates as many as 50 new jobs. If 100,000 new jobs can be created overall, something over Â£750 million would be gained by the Exchequer. Most construction products are produced from United Kingdom sources so the import bill for expanded house building will be modest. House building primarily stimulated United Kingdom materials suppliers. Part of the cost of the investment programme would be offset by savings in benefits and recovered tax income."" On the same theme, Shelter says, "" In 1990 nearly 5,000 building firms became insolvent, followed by 7,000 in 1991. The building employers estimate that an average of 600 jobs-about 300,000 in total-will have been lost each working day in the past two years to the end of 1992. Another 100,000 could be lost by the end of 1993. Each unemployed person costs the state, on average, Â£8,900 in benefits and lost tax. In just two years the collapse of the construction industry may well have cost the Exchequer Â£2,700 million, and much more if unemployment in related trades is considered ... If lost corporation tax and stamp duty are included, the recession in the construction industry has probably already cost over Â£4,000 million."" Later, I will set out arguments as to why that figure is larger. The motion talks about links between different agencies and appropriate housing for people with disabililities. What do I mean by that? One of the most frustrating aspects of public administration in the United Kingdom is the way in which everything works in little boxes. Departments and, indeed, empires build up in splendid isolation with no knowledge or even a care about the rest of the world. In addressing the problem which we face in that area, we can examine the health links. Shelter argues that "" meeting the needs of homeless people costs more per person than meeting the needs of the rest of the population."" That is fairly obvious. It says that the issue is causing considerable concern to health authorities-we have not seen any action on that-but, as yet, there are no estimates of cost. Similarly, few studies have estimated the costs of bad housing. The Department of Health has recently estimated that the cost to the NHS of treating illnesses created through condensation runs at Â£800 million per year. We must add that to the figure of Â£4,000 million and all the other health cost implications. Likewise, much of what happens on the ground with regard to social services relies on the good will of local authority officers trying desperately to solve the housing-related issues which stem from, for example, care in the community. We need a lead from the top to resolve some of the housing-associated problems. My final illustration of the need for greater cross departmental links relates to people with disabilities. Is there not a basic human right for people to be housed in appropriate conditions or are the Government happy to see people such as the young man I saw a fortnight ago whose mother is becoming more and more ill coping with his disability? The Government are not allowing the local authority to spend money which is available to provide that man with proper ramps or a stair lift. Not only should existing moneys be released: we should have a long hard look at the method of delivery. Even the Department of the Environment recognises that people with disabilities are discriminated against, although it does not seem to do much about it. In early 1992, data showed that only 30 accessible homes were being built for every 100,000 disabled people and that there were 1,170,000 outstanding requests for adaptations to existing homes. I doubt whether there is a better example of discrimination anywhere in the United Kingdom. I shall now turn to the economic issues and the solutions to the problems with which I have been dealing. I know that my hon. Friends intend to expand some of the arguments that I have set out. Many of the necessary solutions are well described in a document published by Shelter last year called "" Moving Forward. A Programme to Meet Housing Need."" On council and housing association empty homes it says: "" These would be brought back into use through rehabilitation and improvement work. Councils could also fund housing association repairs in return for nomination rights for homeless households currently in temporary housing. The programme envisages that 30,000 empty homes would be repaired and brought back into use over a five year period."" The programme also deals with private sector leasing and purchase. It says: "" Councils should be allowed to offer owners of homes, used on a lease, a cash sum to buy the home when the lease expires. There are currently an estimated 17,500 homes used on lease by councils in England, with the majority in London."" The programme makes recommendations about private purchase. It says: "" This would involve the purchase of private unsold and repossessed homes by local authorities and housing associations from developers, lenders and private owners. Advantage could be taken of the current state of the private housing market."" The programme also deals with private and Government empty homes. We often hear comments from Conservative Members about the number of empty local authority homes. The number of empty homes is very large. Throughout the land a total of 640,000 houses are vacant, many of which are in the private sector and require finance in the ways that were described earlier. Some empty homes are in local authority hands and 31,000 are in Government hands. The Government could take a lead in making empty homes available through an expansion of shared and low-cost home ownership. An expansion of the existing programme of shared and do-it-yourself ownership through housing associations would meet the needs of many households. Of course, it is also necessary to expand new build. I refer hon. Members back to my earlier comments about the House-Builders Federation. That new build clearly needs to be demonstrably targeted towards the homeless.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,7,housing,1516

The two socialist parties-Labour and the alliance-fought that Bill word for word and line by line. They did not want council tenants and new town commission tenants to have the right to buy. However, when the policy proved popular, Labour and the alliance changed their view. There was no longer talk of buying back the properties. All of a sudden that was quietly dumped, although Labour was in difficulty with its left-wing councils throughout the country. Lambeth is not an isolated case. Socialist-controlled Basildon district council is one reason why the Conservative party is in the majority and the Labour party in opposition. When the market got into difficulty and interest rates rose, the Labour party decided that it was not such a good idea for people to own their own house.

In 1976-77 the council was in deep consultation with the Department of the Environment and got to the point of taking over the property. At the last minute, it phoned the Department and the deal was called off. Goodness knows how much that cost us. The council could have taken over CNT housing stock, which then comprised 15,000 properties, at any time during the next eight or nine years. The Conservative Government even shortened the time required under the transfer scheme from six to three months, but nothing happened until 1985, when socialist-controlled Basildon district council put in an offer. It offered Â£500,000 for those properties, although the current value of the remaining 12,000 properties is Â£113 million. Since that time, the dear socialist council has spent more than Â£300,000 of ratepayers' and community charge payers' money on propaganda to kid the people that it wanted to take over those properties.

The cost of the current advertising to CNT tenants about the transfer to the council is being borne by the Government.

There was one famous occasion when I led a delegation of joint estate management representatives, together with a tenant representative-he later became deputy leader of the socialist council-to the Minister then responsible for new towns, Lord Skelmersdale. We played that video in front of that tenant representative after he had told the Minister how fair the council had been in putting its argument. It was the equivalent of a video nasty.

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],271,David Amess,Con,False,"I do not accept that; presumably that was also the feeling of the electors in 1987 in Fulham. The socialist council wreaked havoc, worry and fear, particularly among elderly tenants, for purely political reasons. It should be absolutely ashamed of itself. My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Porter) mentioned capital receipts and it is worth noting that that socialist council, through its disgraceful behaviour, lost for the residents of Basildon between Â£80 million and Â£100 million in capital receipts by not taking over dwellings and leaving them with the CNT. The Basildon Community Housing Association is a home-grown one whose members are non-political. The BCHA also handles the Siporex estate, which is home to 830 low-quality properties. My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware that that housing association is planning to do everything possible to bring that estate and the Cosmos housing in Vange up to standard. The hon. Member for Leeds, West met a number of individuals in Basildon and put his argument, but he should note that the rent of the CNT tenant who opts to transfer to the BCHA will not increase until October 1994. It will then only rise by the rate of inflation until October 1997. After that, the association aims to set a rent increase of not more than 2.5 per cent. above inflation. Under the Government I have no doubt that the inflation rate will be extremely low. That is a cast-iron guarantee and it will be part of a legal agreement between BCHA and the CNT. That will ensure its delivery. The hon. Member for Leeds, West has said in the House today and to my constituents that they should look for a copper-bottomed guarantee on rent. I understand that, but as BCHA is the only body able to offer such a guarantee, one would have expected the hon. Gentleman to advise my constituents to vote for transfer to that association. The council cannot give a rent guarantee as its finances are decided year by year. One could speculate about possible rent increases for council tenants. I know that the hon. Member for Leeds, West also had something to say to my constituents about repairs, but BCHA has guaranteed that it will deal with all major repairs within five years. Again, that guarantee will be subject to a legal agreement with the CNT. The association will also employ local contractors and will seek to create employment and training opportunities for local residents through such work. It will maintain, inside and out, the homes of those who opt to transfer to it. One need only look at Basildon council estates-for example, Craylands-and talk to the tenants to see that the council, when it was socialist, had a shameful record of neglect. Those socialists who ran the council chamber misled and confused people about the difference between commission and council houses. If the hon. Member for Leeds, West had been better briefed he would have known about that. When in Basildon, the hon. Member for Leeds, West talked about tenants' rights, as is the socialist way. Apparently he talked about the benefits of protected assured tenancies as opposed to secure tenancies, but tenancies will be no less secure under the BHCA and tenants will certainly not lose their rights. The local Labour party and its friends in the tenants action group are now putting considerable effort into the ballot. I understand that they are saying that when they regain control of the council everything will go back to how it used to be. God help my constituents if everything goes back to how it used to be. My constituents certainly do not want things to go back to how they used to be, which is why the socialist council was thrown out last year. There is to be a by-election in five weeks' time, not for a Conservative seat, but for a Labour seat. There are only 13 socialists left on Basildon council. The socialist councillor who came in with bright ideas has thrown in the towel as he cannot take the fight any more. He has emigrated to New Zealand, and rumours abound that the leader of the Labour group, who works at the treasury department in Walworth road, has decided that he will no longer stand. One by one, the socialists responsible for destroying community life-they tried to do so, but were unsuccessful in Basildon-are throwing in the towel and running off. When the Conservatives took control of the council last May, they we are left with hardly enough money to collect the refuse, let alone concentrate on housing. The socialists appointed a number of politically motivated council employees, which was an absolute disgrace. Officers should always be politically neutral and independent. It is not for officers to make political decisions, but for the elected representatives. It is quite wrong for local government officers to become party political. If they do not like what the Conservative council is currently doing, they should leave with good grace. When I hear interventions from Opposition Members trying to laugh at housing associations- If they are laughing at me, I am delighted.

At present, the Conservative-controlled council is doing a magnificent job in difficult circumstances. As the present chairman of housing has said, it is extraordinary that the Labour council, as it was until last May, promised for years to take over the CNT properties, but did not. It has taken a Conservative council to do so-and it has taken a socialist Member of Parliament to visit my constituency and advise my constituents to vote in favour of a Conservative council.

I shall begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) on securing the debate on an important subject that involves one of the most dreadful problems facing any individual or family in this country: the prospect of not having a decent home in which to live. There are some things in life that we should be able to take for granted, and having a roof over our heads is one of them. I am sure that many hon. Members can recite many examples of the tragedies facing constituents who come to their advice surgeries, hoping that their Member of Parliament can help them to find a decent home. The people that I meet in Lewisham, East are not asking for very much. They simply want a decent home, with space for their children to grow and play, where they can feel secure and get on with the rest of their lives. That is something that we would all expect for ourselves and we all hope to try to achieve for our constituents. However, too many people spend years on waiting lists. They live in overcrowded and sub-standard accommodation with little prospect of anything better. If they are young and single, their chances are even less. I shall concentrate on the position in London and the horrendous housing crisis in the nation's capital. There are more than 40,000 families in temporary accommodation in London. That probably means that about 100,000 children have no permanent home. That number has been steadily increasing every year for the past 11 years. It may surprise Conservative Members to learn that two-thirds of all temporary accommodation in this country used for homeless families is here in London. Those figures, enormous as they are, do not tell the whole story. They do not include the single homeless who are not counted in the statistics because, under the Housing Act 1985, their need is not considered a priority. I-and I dare say many of my colleagues-have to tell young people who visit the surgeries that they have little chance of being housed. Therefore, we now have on the streets of our capital city 2,000 people sleeping rough.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,43,housing,385

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],276,Bridget Prentice,Lab,False,"I certainly advise those people who come to my surgery of the realities of life and the housing problems that they face under the Conservative Government. I advise them to seek housing association nominations. Lewisham council and its local housing associations work closely together, and the council nominates people to housing association lists. I advise people to seek accommodation in the private rented sector, but they tell me that it is difficult because of the amount of money initially required. People have to pay lump sums that they simply do not have in their pockets, so it is nonsense to suggest that they should use the private rented sector. Some 5,000 people are in bed and breakfast accommodation which is often poor quality. There are 15,000 people in short-life property and 17,000 in hostels. There are 80,000 people in London in overcrowded households. For any nation to admit to such figures is surely, at the very least, embarrassing. For Britain to do so, with 500,000 construction workers on the dole, is a national disgrace. Homelessness is only the most obvious expression of the housing crisis in London. We should never forget the thousands of people living in poor and deteriorating housing-the overcrowded families, the people with disabilities trapped in their homes because access is poor or impossible, and the growing numbers of home owners facing mounting debt and repossession. Let us examine what is happening here in our capital city. More than 1Â·1 million of London's homes are either unfit for human habitation or are fit but in need of serious renovation; 79 per cent. of the unfit houses-four out of five-are in the private sector. A quarter of a million households are on council waiting lists. Many of them are families with children, elderly people or people with disabilities who need specialist accommodation. More than 60,000 households in London are defined as seriously overcrowded, and about 110,000 council tenants are on council transfer lists. These are staggering figures, yet in 1991-92 only 500 new homes were built by councils and a further 1,800 were made available through conversion and renovation. To call that a drop in the ocean is an understatement. London's councils could house only 9,000 families and enable another 17,000 to move. At that rate it will take 25 years to house the people already on waiting lists and another six and a half years to transfer existing council tenants. The fact is, however, that these people will not be rehoused, because others with more pressing needs will join them, every day of every week of every year, in every London borough. I have already said that the numbers of families in temporary accommodation continue to rise. That is because London's councils are accepting about 38,000 families-as they did in 1991-92-but can provide accommodation for only about 25,000 of them. We tend to think of the housing crisis as affecting only those who want to rent. That is simply untrue. Although repossessions have slowed a little in the past year, the number of people in arrears has markedly increased. According to some figures, about Â£169 million is owed to building societies in mortgage arrears. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston spoke about negative equity. Four out of 10 of the people in London who bought their homes between 1988 and 1991 have an average negative equity of Â£5,500-yet prices continue to fall, and although building societies are beginning to accept lower repayments, I fear that as unemployment relentlessly rises their goodwill will soon disappear and people will be out on the streets. So what is to be done? Clearly, the Government do not know, and the hon. Member for Basildon has even less understanding of the housing crisis.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,45,housing,625

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],278,Bridget Prentice,Lab,False,"Having delivered his polemic, the hon. Gentleman has indeed disappeared from the debate. The Government have made no plans to deal with the problems of homelessness in London. They have not even conducted a survey of London's housing needs. Instead, we have been showered with publicity about two initiatives which do no more than recycle existing public spending. I agree that they have been worthwhile initiatives, but they can hardly be considered adequate. They have had only a marginal impact on the situation in the capital. First, there was the two-year Â£300 million homelessness programme, which at least recognised that there was a problem that needed dealing with. When it began, 31,485 families were in temporary accommodation. When it finished, 37,058 households were in temporary accommodation-hardly a startling success. It is tragic that nothing has replaced that programme. Despite the best efforts of the Association of London Authorities and the London Boroughs Association, the Department of the Environment has resisted any increase in the share of resources to councils and housing associations in line with levels of homelessness. Then there was the rough sleepers initiative, with Â£96 million provided over three years, followed by another Â£60 million. I agree that the initiative reduced the numbers of people on the streets in central areas of London, but it did not solve the problem. About 1,500 permanent places were found, together with some temporary beds in hostels. Yet, as my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford), a recognised expert on this subject, will probably say if he has the opportunity to speak, we need about 10,000 permanent places for single homeless people to stop the hostels being clogged up with people who cannot move to more permanent accommodation. Another aspect affecting particularly London, and perhaps other areas too, is that of refugees. The Government have done nothing to help councils in this respect. My constituency contains about 41 households with refugee status and recognised as homeless, but the Government have offered no help to councils with refugees on their lists. The same questions can be asked about the Government's help for homeless former home owners, and the same reply will be heard. The Government have done little or nothing for them. London has been the scene of the greatest number of repossessions, and the mortgage rescue schemes, which have flopped, have done nothing to help these people, who bought their homes during the 1980s and earlier. The Government refused to talk to councils or lenders about resolving the problem. The autumn statement, which concluded the housing market package of about Â£570 million for housing associations, would provide in London only about 3,500 houses-less than a year's increase in the number of homeless households in temporary accommodation. Because of the tight rules, the associations have found it very difficult to buy enough cheap properties in high-cost areas-the very ones in which there is the most acute need of affordable rented accommodation. The London boroughs have tried hard to come to terms with the problem, co-operating with one another in trying to deal with homelessness. They have cut down on the use of bed and breakfast; Lewisham borough council does not use it at all. They have expanded private sector leasing schemes-from fewer than 3,000 in 1988 to about 24,000 today. They have tried to cut the costs of bed-and-breakfast accommodation by implementing a pricing policy and an hotels inspection and grading system. And they have made new arrangements with the housing associations so that they have many more nominations. They also provide hostel and winter shelters for single homeless people and fund voluntary sector homelessness projects. What the councils need-like the homeless of London-is just a little help and support from the Government. The Government will reply, "" We are letting councils use their capital receipts until December of this year,"" but that is no great shakes when we remember that, because of the recession, sales of land and homes have declined and prices are depressed. Much of what councils can sell has already been sold at discounts to housing associations and tenants. The Government are clawing back the receipts in any case through the estate action schemes and urban programmes. If they really wanted to give a serious boost to the economy they would free up the Â£5Â·1 billion of accumulated receipts. Even the distribution of receipts that we have will not be equal across the nation, and efforts will have to be made to target the areas in greatest need. London needs an agreed plan to reduce homelessness, drawn up by the Department of the Environment, local councils and others concerned about the crisis in the capital, and, after proper consultation, to set out precise targets and time scales. Local councils and the voluntary sector should be given responsibility for implementing an expanded single homelessness programme to cover the capital. The Government should increase the priority attached to homelessness and temporary accommodation levels in allocating capital resources to councils and housing associations. They can do that simply by adopting the ALA-LBA proposal of a comprehensive homelessness indicator. It is high time that the Government started talking sensibly with the London associations and revising arrangements for the winter shelter programme by allowing shelters in outer London boroughs such as Croydon and Newham, where there was clearly a need in the past year but no funding. They should change the private sector leasing scheme to allow councils to take up to 20-year leases instead of phasing out the grant that meets a portion of the cost of those leases. They should work jointly with councils and lenders to plan a range of initiatives to support home owners. There must be a specific grant to assist in rehousing refugees. I said that it was rather tragic that we should have to have a debate on housing in a society where having a roof over one's head is something that we all take for granted. I repeat my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston on raising the subject, and I am only sorry that such a tale of neglect and dereliction of duty must be laid squarely at the Government's door.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,47,housing,1034

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],290,Nigel Jones,LibDem,False,"Our housing problems are entirely of the Government's own making. Their obsession with home ownership, their neglect of other tenures and their assault on local authorities have compounded the problems caused by the recession, which the Government created through their economic incompetence. They have caused a dangerous imbalance of tenure in the housing market. In 1992, repossessions fell from 75,000 to 68,000. That was a welcome improvement, but it was still 68,000 human disasters. However, mortgage arrears increased and, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, 205,000 households were six to 12 months behind in their mortgages in the second part of 1992 and 147,000 were over one year in arrears. Negative equity, when houses are worth less than the mortgage on them, is also spiralling, with an estimated 1Â·5 million households stuck in that trap. Hon. Members will have seen the report in last Friday's issue of "" Mortgage Weekly"", of the paper that Daniel Dorling of the housing and society research group at Newcastle university presented to the European housing finance seminar at Bristol university on 4 February. Mr. Dorling said: "" The rise of negative equity is now preventing individuals from spending, and reducing the mobility of skilled labour. It has halted the widespread use of homes as assets upon which capital can be raised for investment. It is preventing people from moving house when they need to. Freedom of movement-freedom to choose where to live-is being eroded by the inefficient operation of the supposedly free market."" He also said about the way people look at housing: "" Many now see it neither as a worthwhile gamble nor a secure investment, despite most houses being much less expensive now than a few years ago and the overall cost of home buying being at its lowest level in real terms since 1971."" Public housing has been hit by the Government's inept housing policy. Public spending on housing has been cut by 62 per cent. since 1979 from Â£11Â·5 billion to under Â£6 billion. It is no wonder that fewer than 170,000 new homes are being completed a year-an all-time low. With massive repossessions and a huge homelessness problem, local authorities have to pick up the pieces, but they no longer have the ability to do so. Some 150,000 people were accepted as homeless in 1991 and 8,000 people sleep rough every night. The Government's response is to encourage further reductions in public housing stock. The Government must allow local authorities to spend their accrued capital receipts, so that they can start building homes for the homeless. In the autumn statement, the Government tried to boost the housing market by giving money to housing associations to buy repossessed properties. This has not happened. Out of 13,169 properties purchased up to 29 January, only 5,000 have been repossessed properties. The rest have been new build. In my constituency, only three properties have been purchased. I spoke to a senior estate agent this weekend and asked him what he thought about that. He said, "" Three hundred might put a bottom in the market, but three is useless."" What is needed is not piecemeal panic projects but a coherent housing strategy. We need a sector-in between renting and owner-occupation-of shared ownership, to encourage flexibility in the market. We need new co-operation between local authorities, Government and housing associations to tackle the appalling problem of homelessness. Capital receipts must be released. Most of all, we need a Government with a coherent economic policy to encourage recovery and invest in infrastructure and housing projects. Until that happens, we shall still have a massive housing problem, and an economy in slump with hundreds of thousands of building workers on the dole-",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,59,housing,617

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],293,Gary Streeter,Con,False,"I had hoped to come to the debate to make common cause with the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) because I appreciate that there are Opposition Members, as there are Government Members, who are genuinely concerned about housing issues. I was looking forward to hearing some suggestions as to what we can do, in addition to the many things that the Government are already doing, to meet those needs; I was looking forward to hearing new ideas that would help to solve the problems. Having listened intently to two hours of the debate, I remain disappointed in what I have heard from the Opposition. We never hear any solutions from the Opposition. All that we get are moans, gripes and complaints. There is never a single costing to be had. They talk about policies and the need for more public housing and more council houses, but they do not speak of the cost of such housing. The only constructive suggestion from the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mr. Prentice) was that we should set up a talking shop to allow various bodies to discuss what should be done. The Government are already seeking and finding solutions to meeting housing needs in 1993. The Labour party does not know what it wants. All that it knows is that it is in favour of more but it has no idea how much more will cost. That can be demonstrated better than in any other way by taking the example of the endless calls for the release of the Â£5 billion worth of capital receipts. Has the Labour party explained to community charge payers the extra cost that they will have to bear when the interest on capital receipts that rolls into local authorities year after year is no longer there? There is never a word about that. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston dismissed quickly, in half a sentence, the massive contribution made to social housing problems by Labour-controlled local authorities. Everything is the Government's fault, he said. I am afraid that it is not as simple as that. We cannot write off millions of pounds of rent arrears that Labour-controlled authorities have clocked up. We cannot disregard the countless thousands of void properties, even those in London about which the hon. Member for Lewisham, East was concerned.

We know that behind each of those situations is a human tragedy. It is a pity that Opposition Members do not also recognise that. We have heard no solution, no new ideas and no new thoughts.

It is no solution to throw more money at the problem. Those of us who have some local authority experience know that local authority housing has inherent weaknesses and few incentives for excellence. Traditionally, there has been no competition in that sector. Similarly, there has been virtually no accountability and regulation.

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],301,Gary Streeter,Con,False,"I wonder why the hon. Member, who seems to be responsible for causing trouble, scoffs. It is important to understand that estate agents in Plymouth have a vital voice and one that should be echoed in the debate. They have told me that since Christmas there has been much activity in the housing market. It appears that first-time buyers are viewing properties and making offers. Contracts are being exchanged and the housing market is beginning to recover. It is fair to say that the recovery began before the full benefit of recent interest rate cuts started to manifest itself to many mortgage holders. We can look forward with confidence to the market recovering in the spring. We all agree that the housing market is an essential ingredient in the economy. It is a pity that the only contribution that Labour Members can make is to talk the market down. They spend day after day and week after week talking it down. Instead, let us talk up the market. As I have said, it is recovering. There is every reason why it should be because mortgage rates are at an all-time low. Since October 1990, the repayments of the average mortgage holder have been reduced by more than Â£150 a month. That is a success story. People have been enabled to put money in their pockets and to go out and spend. What about the autumn statement, which contained an extra package for social housing? That was designed to get the market moving again. It was a package of Â£750 million, and 20,000 properties were purchased by housing associations throughout the country to rent. Have we heard Labour Members welcome that? Have they offered the Government any congratulations? We have heard not a word. They are always sneering and never congratulating. The Conservative party has been setting the housing agenda for the past 14 years. We have seen the right to buy, right to manage, right to repair, compulsory competitive tendering, rents to mortgages and the boost that was given to housing associations by the autumn statement. All of those initiatives have been taken at the behest of the Conservative Government. In contrast, the Labour party looks barren and sterile as it presents its old ideas. I rarely agree with the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) but on one point-it is a serious one-I must do so. In a recent article that was written for the Fabian Society, the hon.

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],302,John Battle,Lab,False,"Many outside the House will not know or understand the internal lottery system which enables Back-Bench Members to win space in the parliamentary timetable to debate a topic of their choice on the Floor of the House. I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) on choosing to debate the housing crisis. In so doing, he has ensured that housing and homelessness in his constituency and throughout the country are firmly on our agenda. In his thorough approach he underlined the need to consider need, health and disability under the heading of housing. He stressed that such issues should be taken seriously and echoed on the floor of the House more regularly. I am sure that he will continue ensuring that that happens on the basis of his contribution today. We are indebted to him for the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) expressed passionate concern and a deep knowledge of housing in London. She spelled out the bleak prospects which face her constituents and many thousands of others in London unless the Government are jolted out of their rather complacent approach to the housing crisis. It is almost a year since we were presented with the Tories' election promises. We heard tear-jerking threats as soundbites were issued. On 23 March, the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine)-he is now the President of the Board of Trade-said: "" House sales under the Conservatives are picking up. All this would change on 10th April if there were a Labour Government. The recovery in the housing market would be devastated just as it gets under way."" Of course, that was not true. The market was not picking up, and the recovery is still not under way a year later. On 31 March, the Prime Minister echoed the right hon. Gentleman when he said: "" We're going to make life easier for people buying their home and our policies will mean a stronger housing market."" We all know something of the Prime Minister's ability to turn language inside out and to turn meanings on their head. Government policies in the past 12 months have resulted in a weaker housing market. It seems that the stark reality is obvious to everyone except Conservative Members. Only this month, the former head of Wimpeys commented: "" It is the worst recession I have experienced in my 42 years in the construction industry."" There is a crisis in the housing market, and it has been manufactured by escalating unemployment. Last year, 68,000 families had their homes repossessed., According to the latest figures presented by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, 147,000 families are more than 12 months in mortgage arrears and are staring eviction in the face. We are already hearing of people losing their homes because of secondary mortgages. Double glazing companies are causing people to lose their homes by calling in debts of as little as Â£500. Over 1 million people cannot afford to move because their homes are worth less than the prices that they paid for them. They are caught in the negative equity trap described by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. In response, the Prime Minister talks about cash incentives in the Budget for first-time buyers to revive the housing market. Even today, however, there are printed leaks from the Treasury informing us that there may be a 5 per cent. increase in VAT on new home sales in next month's Budget. It seems that everyone except the Government acknowledges that escalating unemployment is undermining the housing market. The fear of redundancy holds families back from extending mortgage commitments. Millions are terrified that they may be just one payslip from redundancy. Faced with that economic insecurity, they dare not risk extending their long-term financial commitments. Escalating unemployment-the figures this week will show another rise-is the primary cause of the crisis in the housing market and the homelessness in our society. What do we need? Although the Government's position is not clear, it is evident to everyone that there is a desperate shortage of rented housing, so the response to the crisis must be the right to rent. However, under Conservative Governments the only policy offered by one Housing Minister after another-there have been many in the past 14 years - has been the discounted right to buy. That single policy instrument has dismantled any post-war consensus on housing. That deep-seated Tory obsession with tenure has led to almost 2 million rented homes disappearing since 1987. Over the same period, there has been a fall in the number of houses built by local authorities and housing associations. The result is a massive imbalance in tenure. At 69 per cent. of the stock, home ownership is proving difficult to sustain. In other words, there is a desperate shortage of decent, affordable and secure housing to rent. There are 1Â·5 million families stuck on local authority housing waiting lists. We must not forget the hidden homeless who share sofas and floors while they wait for their own space. The Institute of Housing, Shelter and the Audit Commission have spelt out the fact that each year there is a shortfall of 100,000 homes to rent. As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) said, on the best estimates, the Government are providing only slightly more than half that number this year. Local councils have been sidelined, undermined and prevented from providing homes. In the latest Department of the Environment annual report, published only last week, the projections for housing under the housing investment programme capital provisions show a decline of Â£325 million between 1992-93 and 1995-96. That is an actual cut in housing budgets, taken out of housing programmes, of Â£100 million a year. Housing associations still have only 3 per cent. of Britain's housing stock, yet they have been given the task, practically on their own, of filling the enormous gap of need. Despite that, day by day they are being undermined by Government changes in the rate of grant. This year it is down from 73 per cent. to 67 per cent. and it appears that next year it will go down further to 60 per cent. and the year after to 55 per cent. What will be the result of that cut in grants? Housing associations will have to borrow more money from the private finance sector, so rents will have to rise beyond the incomes of those not receiving full housing benefit. By those reductions in the rate of grant, the Government are ensuring that housing associations will be turned into providers of welfare housing with a vengeance. They will soon be putting signs in windows saying, "" Rooms to let: DSS only-apply within."" Some 70 per cent. of housing association tenants are on housing benefit, yet rents are still rising. It is tragic. The Government are also building in a work disincentive. They are saying to those on housing benefit, "" You can afford to rent a housing association property, but don't get a job because that will take you out of full housing benefit, you will not be able to afford the rent and you will lose your flat."" The Government must deal with the problem of housing benefit. The latest Department of Social Security report, also published last week, shows that the amount spent on rent in the housing association and private rented sector has doubled. A real poverty trap is built into the system for those who are not on housing benefit. Their homes are at risk because they have to spend more than their incomes to meet the rent demanded. I hope that the Government will begin to deal with the problem of affordability. A report from the Housing Corporation was discreetly placed in the Library. I hope that the Government will provide a full debate on affordability because under their policies housing association houses are becoming beyond most people's means. Homelessness has more than doubled since 1979. A record number of 65,000 families are now in temporary accommodation. They are wondering whether "" temporary"" actually means for the rest of their lives. I recently met a young woman called Michelle who had been moved across London, away from her family and friends, when she was taken out of bed and breakfast. She lost her daughter's creche place and she lost access to her training course. She said that she felt like an exile from her community. She wants to get out of temporary and into permanent accommodation among her family and friends so that she can rebuild her life and find a job. The crisis in temporary accommodation is tragic. I accept that the number of people in bed and breakfast is falling, which is welcome, but the problem cannot be solved simply by putting people into temporary accommodation. They need permanent secure housing where they can build basic communities with their friends and their families. I remind the Minister for Housing and Planning that at the launch of the rough sleepers initiative he said that people sleeping on the streets of London would disappear by February 1992. It is now February 1993. If, when we leave the House tonight, we walked the streets of London, we would still meet many homeless people. Just before Christmas, late one night, I left the House and I spoke to some homeless youngsters. I was shocked because when I asked them how old they were, those who were confident enough to answer did not say that they were in their 20s or 30s-certainly they were not, as in the past, older people broken by war or alcohol-they said that they were 16. That suggests that many of them were not 16, but younger. I was shocked that youngsters of 16 were on the streets of London. Another factor was important. When I asked them where they last lived, most of them said that they had been in local authority care. That care runs out at 16 and those youngsters have to fend for themselves. The Government have a responsibility to deal with the problems of youngsters of 16 who come out of local authority care but are then left to fend for themselves and so end up on the streets. I shall return to that point later.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,71,housing,1727

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],307,John Battle,Lab,False,"No, I must move on. I want to give the Minister time to reply. In our society there are 80,000 single homeless people. We now face the introduction of care in the community, without the proper backing. The Minister should remember the line in the White Paper: "" Housing is the key to independent living."" Unless the resources to provide such housing are passed on to local authorities, we shall face increasing homelessness among the most marginalised members of our society-those who may be discharged from hospitals. It will stare us in the face from 1 April this year. I could echo some of the local comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. In Yorkshire, homelessness has risen by 60 per cent. in the past six years; in Leeds, there has been a 34 per cent. increase in homelessness inquiries between 1988-89 and 1991-92. Last year, there were 10,000 inquiries; 10,000 people applied for housing, and were registered as homeless. A total of 24,000 households are on waiting lists; the figure is up 30 per cent. since 1983-84. In 1980-81, Leeds city council built 1,200 homes; in 1991-92, it could build only 18. That is a telling figure. There is not enough housing to rent. The council was not even able to replace the housing that it had lost through sales, including housing association accommodation. Although homes are now coming from housing associations in partnership with the local authority, the authority is not being allowed to use capital receipts to replace the rented housing that has been lost. It is no wonder that people are homeless. One third of the homeless people in Leeds have been in care, and those people are vulnerable. The Government should examine, across Departments, the desperate need for supported accommodation for young people. The private market is not providing it, and housing associations have been priced out of special needs. Who will provide those homes? The Government's cool complacency reflects a chillingly barren policy, and an absence of real, co-ordinated housing action. The housing crisis is frozen in the permafrost of the economic recession which is gripping the country. The real dereliction, as will be revealed when the English house conditions survey is published later this year, is the dereliction of duty by a Government and a Minister attempting to sustain an image of competence from day to day, floated on daily departmental press releases as one phoney piecemeal initiative after another is launched, sinks and is launched again. Two weeks ago, for instance, we received a press release telling us of the virtues of the "" flats over shops"" initiative. Last week, the annual report of the Department of the Environment told us that there would be nothing in the 1995-96 budget programme. We are told that the capital partnership initiative has a future, but the annual report provides nothing in the 1994-95 budget. Action could be taken, however. I will put a five-point action plan to the Minister. First, more rented housing should be provided. On every working day since June 1979, 600 building workers have lost their jobs; they have continued to do so, yet there are fields full of bricks in Bedfordshire. The need is there, the skills are there, the materials are there and the resources are there; yet Â£5-7 billion is locked up in capital receipts. That money could be used to provide housing. The Government refuse to link jobs and housing, which flies in the face of ordinary common sense. The Government can and must provide more rented housing. What is needed is a housing need package, not a housing market package. Secondly, I ask the Minister to extend the rough sleepers initiative beyond London. Sixty per cent. of those sleeping rough are on the streets of Brighton, Bristol and other towns and cities throughout the land. Thirdly, the Government should immediately restore income support for 16 and 17-year-olds, which was removed by the present Prime Minister in 1988. The removal of that benefit is increasingly seen as a cause of homelessness among young people. Fourthly, the Government should publish and use the English house conditions survey, which will s how that nearly 1.5 million properties are now in serious disrepair. They should use it as a renovation and renewal charter, change the failed means-tested improvement grant system and ensure that the construction industry is free of the increases in value-added tax on building repairs that we are told the Budget may contain. Such increases would drive the construction industry even further back. Fifthly, the Government could support and publicise a real mortgage rescue scheme. I suggest that the Minister take a look at the Bradford and Bingley building society, and support fully mutual housing associations which allow families to remain in their own homes and be charged rent. The Government should support mortgage-to-rent schemes rather than rent-to-mortgage schemes. To sum up my five points for action, I suggest more rented housing, an extension of the rough sleepers scheme, the restoration of income support for youngsters, the use of the English house conditions survey for renewal and improvement, and support for real mortgage rescue schemes. Too many people are being denied the basic right to a decent, affordable and secure home. The current housing crisis is the most vivid symbol of the failure of the free market myth. What is needed is real choice, not just abuse of the word. Without real choice between tenures, which must include the right to rent, millions will remain locked out of decent housing that they can call a home of their own.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,76,housing,937
1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],308,Tony Baldry,Con,False,"The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) has done his party a favour. He has done something that his Front Bench has not seemed willing to do since the general election: he has initiated a debate on housing. The hon. Gentleman's initiative stands in stark contrast to the utterances of hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench, who seem more concerned with attacking the royal family than with debating housing. I am not surprised about that, because Opposition Front-Bench Members never seem to mention housing. A recent speech by the Leader of the Opposition, supposedly outlining Labour's agenda for the next decade, completely failed to mention housing. As for the recent interview in Tribune with the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), who graced us with a fleeting appearance a moment ago, he told us last week that the entire interview was tape recorded by the author. He then told the House that the direct quotation of any words was correct; the only problem was that the article made no mention of housing. Why, then, is housing off Labour's agenda? Simply because Labour has no policy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. Streeter) made clear in his excellent speech, little by little over the past decade Labour has come to accept, and then to endorse, our policies. That applies to the right to buy, housing action trusts and the ability of councils to transfer their stock to housing associations. All those policies were once bitterly opposed by Labour authorities; all are now embraced by them. Waltham Forest, Tower Hamlets, Hull, Birmingham and Liverpool-all those councils, Labour and Liberal, are now promoting housing action trusts in their areas. The Opposition would have denied those opportunities to thousands of tenants. The hon. Member for Blackburn boasted to Tribune, "" We run urban Britain."" Perhaps that is another reason why Labour says nothing about housing: the nation will look at Labour's housing record, which is lousy, as tellingly illustrated by my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Mr. Amess). He described how ill served Basildon's housing interests were under a Labour council. We, by contrast, have much to offer when it comes to housing. Therefore, I welcome the debate. It enables the Government to reinforce their determination that a decent home should be within the reach of every family and our determination to promote owner-occupation, to widen choice for tenants, to encourage further private investment in the rented sector and to increase the supply of decent homes for rent.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,77,housing,423

1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],310,Tony Baldry,Con,False,"The hon. Gentleman might reflect upon the fact that, at the end of 1990-91, Ellesmere Port's accumulated debt in rent arrears amounted to nearly Â£500,000-Â£474,000, to be precise. I suspect that if the local authority had been more effective in collecting its rents, it would have been able to invest that money in local authority stock. The opportunity to own a home and to pass it on is one of the most important rights that an individual has in a free society. We have extended that right. Home ownership lies at the heart of our philosophy. We want to see wealth and security being passed down from generation to generation. Surveys show that owner-occupation is the preferred tenure of every age group from every background in every part of the country. Some 4 million more householders now own their own home compared with 1979. The number of former council tenants who have bought their homes has risen to nearly 1Â·5 million. Recent house price reports show that encouraging signs of stability may now be returning to the housing market. At 6 per cent., interest rates are at their lowest for 15 years. Average mortgage rates are now 7 percentage points below their peak. Indeed, average mortgage rates are now at their lowest level since March 1969. With the latest cut in mortgage rates, reductions over the past two years have saved a family with a typical mortgage Â£160 a month. Home purchase is now more affordable and more attractive. The ratio of mortgage payments to income is at its most advantageous level for a quarter of a century. That must be good news for buyers and builders alike. We are committed to making the aspiration o f home ownership a reality for as many households as possible. The right to buy for council tenants has become a resounding success. We are determined to continue to respond to people's aspiration to own their own home. Thousands of tenants have been able to take advantage of cash incentive payments that enable housing associations and local councils to help existing tenants to move into home ownership and free their current home for new tenants. All around the country, successful shared ownership schemes, supported by the Government, have enabled many more people to become home owners. We are determined to make it easier for those council tenants living in high cost areas or on low incomes to move gradually into home ownership without taking on too heavy a financial burden at any one time. Our rent-to-mortgage scheme will give tenants a further route to home ownership. We care about council tenants who want to buy but who cannot afford to do so outright. We shall continue to drive for home ownership and make sure that tenants are aware of their new rights. Many tenants will consider that now is the time to take advantage of low prices, low interest rates and substantial discounts. Of course we recognise that not everybody can or will want to buy their own home. Our aim is to ensure that a decent home is available to every family, whether it be owned, rented from a private landlord, or rented in the public sector. That means that encouraging and supporting home ownership is complemented by measures to increase availability and choice in rented housing, to target investment and support to those areas and to those people most in need and to ensure that the billions of pounds of taxpayers' money that we are investing and continue to invest in housing is put to the best possible use by improving the performance and value for money achieved by those who spend it.",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,79,housing,611

Bearing in mind that concern, will the Minister give the House an assurance tonight that there will not be a reduction in grant rates that would lead to great increases in rents and serious affordability problems for housing association tenants?",12753,['Environment'],Housing,1,80,housing,94
1993-02-15,Housing [Environment],312,Tony Baldry,Con,False,"I thought that the hon. Gentleman intended in his intervention to explain why it was that at the end of 1991 Greenwich had rent arrears of Â£13 million. He will have seen from evidence of the Housing Corporation that there is no generic affordability problem for housing associations. Last week I was in the area of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston where concern was raised by a housing association about housing association grants and housing association rents. That same afternoon I visited a scheme in Manchester where six housing associations are providing good, affordable houses at housing association grant rates of 50 per cent. They are providing houses at rents which everybody recognises are affordable. We are investing billions of pounds in housing. This year alone, more than Â£8 billion will be spent on social housing, most by local authorities but some Â£2.3 billion of it by the Housing Corporation, in providing new, affordable social housing through housing associations. New investment in housing received a significant boost in the autumn statement with the housing market package and the ability of local authorities to spend 100 per cent. of their capital receipts raised before the end of this year. That ability could, we believe, generate some Â£1-75 billion for local authorities. That is in addition to the money that will be given to them through the housing investment programme. Those figures are based on local authorities' own estimates of what they have raised and are likely to raise from capital receipts in 1992-93. All hon. Members should, therefore, ensure that their local authorities are seeking properly to maximise their capital receipts this year and putting them to good use. The housing market package has been a great success. The Housing Corporation now estimates that the money for housing associations in England to buy new, empty and repossessed homes, announced as part of the overall Â£750 million housing market package, will allow the purchase of over 17,000 properties in England by the end of March. Nearly 15,000 purchases have already been approved. More than 90 per cent. of the original target of 16,000 houses has been achieved, using just over 80 per cent. of the available funds. Another 3,500 homes will be bought with the help of cash grants to existing tenants moving into ower-occupation. Taken together with the substantial fall in interest rates, the housing market package is having a positive impact on the housing market. The Housing Corporation and the housing associations involved are to be congratulated on their excellent performance in translating these substantial sums made available into new homes. This financial year, and over the next three years, housing associations should have some Â£10.5 billion to invest in new social housing-Â£7.5 billion from the Treasury to the Housing Corporation, and Â£3 billion of private finance. In our manifesto we promised to provide 153,000 new affordable homes over three years to 1994-95. The Housing Corporation now estimates that it will be able substantially to improve upon that figure and to fund some 170,000 new homes over the same period. Those new homes will go a long way towards improving matters for households accepted as homeless by local authorities and currently living in temporary accommodation. Even before the autumn statement, the number of families housed in bed and breakfast accommodation was falling. It is down now to just over 11,000. I hope that local authorities, working with the housing associations, will now be able to bring these figures down even further. For those most visibly in housing need, we have extended the rough sleepers initiative, with a further Â£86 million being made available to the voluntary organisations which are managing the programme. While housing associations are the main providers of new social housing, it is also important that we continue to invest in council housing as effectively as possible. This we are doing through the housing investment programme and large-scale schemes such as estate action and housing action trusts, which help to tackle some of our more difficult estates. Up and down the country this year we are spending Â£330 million on 360 estate action schemes. Next year the budget of Â£350 million will enable another 160 new schemes to start. Estate action schemes enable money to be invested to turn rundown housing into areas where people can again be proud to live: where appropriate, tower blocks are pulled down and new family-designed homes are built; unpopular deck access blocks are converted into popular family homes; the quality of homes is improved with, where appropriate, new roofs, new wiring and new PVC windows; and areas of sterile public space in which no one has a sense of ownership are turned into gardens. The planners call that "" defensible space"". To all of us, and to the people who live in the area, that means gardens. Crime is designed out.

1993-04-01,Housing [Orders Of The Day > Defence],441,Nick Raynsford,Lab,False,"I am pleased to have this opportunity to raise the important subject of affordability in housing-albeit not at the hour that I, or I suspect the other participants in the debate, would have chosen. I start by declaring an interest as the director of a housing consultancy which has advised a number of organisations on matters germane to the debate. It is an important subject, which has become a matter of grave concern in recent years. There have been problems of affordability in all tenures. In the home ownership market, there has been a crisis of debt and repossessions. The number of home owners facing the prospect of losing their home through repossession rose from 16,000 in 1989 to 75,000 in 1991 and 68,000 last year. At the beginning of last year, the Prime Minister made the rash claim on, of all places, the radio programme "" Desert Island Discs"": "" We have stopped repossessions."" Some 68,000 households bear witness to the Government's failure to honour that pre-election promise. Although the rise in repossessions has been stemmed, that cannot be said of the problem of mortgage debt. At the last count, 350,000 households were more than six months in arrears with their mortgage, and 147,000 of them were more than 12 months in arrears. Many of those households will face the misery of repossession and the loss of their home-sadly, some of them already do so. They are the victims of the failed economic policies of the 1980s, which were claimed as an economic miracle on the basis of a credit binge that came to a sickening halt in 1988, leaving all too many people with debts that proved to be millstones round their necks. Many home owners were left with properties that were worth less than the mortgage outstanding on them-a problem that has become known in the trade language as negative equity. On the latest estimates, that problem affects at least 1Â·5 million householders, who are locked into the unwelcome trap where they find it virtually impossible to move because the sum that they would receive from selling their house would be substantially less than the amount that they have outstanding on their mortgage for it. Affordability problems are not confined to the owner-occupied sector. They are seen just as starkly in all parts of the rented sector. Council tenants have faced continuing steep rent increases as a direct consequence of Government policy, specifically the new subsidy framework introduced by the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Under that framework, the Government have been able to determine, to all intents and purposes, the level of rent that each local authority has to set. One of the curious features of the subsidy framework is that the Government set notional rents for each local authority in the country-an extraordinary example of centralisation, where the gentlemen in Whitehall claim to have a better knowledge of what the rent levels should be in any area of the country than do those people who have been democratically elected from the local communities. Those in Whitehall use formulae that are so confusing and arcane that they produce complete nonsense. They claim that the rent levels will reflect market values, but produce results that lead to higher rents in areas where market values are patently substantially lower than in other regions. In my local authority district of Greenwich, rents have had to rise this year by Â£4, to an average of Â£41Â·65 per tenant per week-an increase of more than 10 per cent, which is more than three times the inflation rate. Most scandalous of all is the fact that the forced rent increases have both enabled, and provided the vehicle for, the Government to offload on to council tenants an ever-increasing proportion of the cost of housing benefit. In the coming year, Â£790 million of housing benefit costs are being forced on to the rents of council tenants. That will result in an average increase in rent of Â£3Â·85 a week for every council tenant in the country to meet the cost of housing benefit for other tenants. Not only is that monstrously unfair, but in no other tenure is a similar provision applicable. There would be a national outcry if it were suggested that similar provisions should apply in other tenures. Imagine the alarm if it were suggested that every home owner in Britain should pay a surcharge on his mortgage equivalent to Â£200 a year-that is the exactly equivalent figure-towards the cost of income support payments to other home owners in financial difficulties. That is the framework that the Government have introduced in respect of council tenants, forcing some to pay higher rent than they would otherwise need to pay so as to meet part of the cost of benefits to other tenants. That is not only grossly unfair, but involves a scandalous breach of faith. When housing benefit was first introduced, the Government repeatedly pledged that the full cost would be borne by central Government and not offloaded on to local authorities. The Prime Minister, then a mere Back Bencher, speaking in a debate on what was then the Social Security and Housing Benefits Bill, asked specifically for an assurance on the point: "" If 2Â·3 million people on supplementary benefit are likely to be transferred to a local authority rebate scheme, are the Government proposing to accept 100 per cent. liability for the costs of that scheme""? He was given an assurance by the then Minister, Mr. Hugh Rossi, in the same debate: "" The Government have undertaken to local authorities to reimburse to them 100 per cent. of any additional costs that they incur under housing benefit ... When I talk of the costs, I am talking of the 100 per cent. rebate on rents and rates that will be granted"".- We have a clear and categorical assurance, given in response to questions from many people, including the present Prime Minister, that central Government would reimburse the cost of housing benefit 100 per cent. Now, we see that the reality is different. Some 20 per cent. of the total cost of the housing benefit paid to council tenants is not being met by central Government but is being charged to the rent accounts of tenants-a flagrant breach of a clear pledge, given by the Government of the time. It is rather a sad comment that the Prime Minister who presides over that was party to the original pledge that it would not happen. If council tenants are facing a raw deal because of the Government's actions, so, too, are tenants of private landlords. Deregulation of the private rented market has opened the door to massive increases in rents, when properties are offered on the market not as regulated tenancies but as assured or assured shorthold tenancies. Even those properties subject to rent regulation are seeing steep increases when rents come to be re-registered. On average, they are re-registered at a level 25 per cent. higher than previously. Recently, I was approached by tenants in Greenwich, whose rent had been increased by 58 per cent. To add insult to injury, the increase was almost double the amount that the landlord had requested. The rent officer and rent assessment committee mechanism has produced an extraordinary increase in rents, even above the levels sought by the landlord. There can be no justification for rents being pushed up in that way. Those increases are far in excess of the rate of inflation, and bear no relationship to what is happening in the property market. The Government have often enjoyed making the case that rents should enjoy a closer relationship to market values-they certainly argue that forcibly in relation to their new regime on council rents. However, in the past two years, market values have been declining. Indeed, there has been a significant reduction in house prices. If the relationship to market values were to be sustained, we should now be seeing reductions in the rents that are fixed by rent officers and rent assessment committees, instead of which we see a continuing, inexorable upward trend, which is increasing at a faster rate than previously. In 1988, average registered rents increased by 18 per cent. whereas the increases in 1989, 1990 and 1991 were 19 per cent., 22 per cent. and 25 per cent. During a period when the housing market was declining and capital values were decreasing, rent increases accelerated in the sector that is subject to regulation. The problems are serious for council and private sector tenants, but it is housing association tenants who feel most keenly the issues that surround affordability. It is worth putting the figures in context. When the Housing Act 1988 introduced a new financial framework for housing associations, fears were widely expressed that it would lead to steep rises in association rents. Responding to the expressions of anxiety, Ministers were emphatic that housing association lettings would be "" affordable"". They added that tenants would be protected by a tenants' guarantee, which among other requirements would insist that housing associations set their rents so that they would be in reach of those in low-paid employment. As with so many other pledges offered by the Government, that promise was riot worth the paper on which the tenants' guarantee was written. In 1988, the National Federation of Housing Associations set up a regular monitoring system to record rents being set by associations and the incomes of tenants moving into new lettings. The system has been in operation since the second quarter of 1988. The most recent figures, for the third quarter of 1992, show that, in the intervening four years rents for all housing association lettings increased by a staggering 112 per cent. Housing association rents have more than doubled in just over four years. Yet over the same period, the average income of tenants rose by only 25 per cent., rather below the increases in the retail price index and in average earnings. That reflects the well-known fact that housing association tenants are among the least well-off in Britain. As a consequence of rent levels increasing by more than four times the average income levels of tenants, the affordability ratio has increase. That means that housing association tenants are having to allocate an ever larger proportion of their income to meet their rent. The figures show that about 26 per cent. of their income is taken by rent. That does not take into account other related costs that are incurred through occupation of their homes, such as council tax, water rates and heating costs. In London, where costs are higher, the National Federation of Housing Associations' CORE-continuous recording-monitoring system records that, on average, tenants are putting about 29 per cent. of their income into meeting their rent. The figures are rising all the time. The figures reflect a period when housing association grant rates, on average, were about 75 per cent. of the capital costs of new schemes, but the rates are changing. Last year, the rates were reduced to 72 per cent., and in the coming year they will decrease to 67 per cent. The Government justify the reductions on the ground that building costs have been falling during the recession, so the procurement cost of new housing has been decreasing. It has been possible to get homes more cheaply than previously, and the Government argue that grant rates can be reduced accordingly. There is some truth in that, and it would not concern me, if the Government were ready to increase grant rates when building costs rise-as they inevitably will. Most people familiar with that sector except, once recovery begins, a significant rise in building costs as firms that have cut their margins to the bone to keep alive during the recession attempt to restore profit margins to protect their financial position. As they do so, the procurement costs to housing associations will inevitably rise. While Ministers have been quick to use reduced procurement costs as an explanation, excuse or justification for reducing grant rates, they have been coy about giving the corollary assurance that, in the event of procurement costs increasing, grant rates will rise again to reflect that situation. When the Minister replies, it will be interesting to see whether he can give an assurance that when procurement costs rise again, the Government will accept the need to increase grant rates, to ensure no deterioration in the affordability of homes. We have not received such an assurance so far. I hope that the Minister will cast some light on that aspect, but if not, we will think the worst-that the Government are only too happy to find reasons and excuses for cutting grant rates but far less willing to protect the interests of tenants and housing associations in different circumstances. In the past few months, we have seen different indications of the Government's intentions. The autumn statement signalled the Government's objective of reducing grant rates to 60 per cent. in 1994-95 and to 55 per cent. in 1995-96. The National Federation of Housing Associations analysed the implications, and reached the stark conclusion that the consequence would be an increase in average rents to a level 75 per cent. higher in 1996 than those measured in the CORE monitoring system in 1992. In particular, working households becoming association tenants would face an average rent of Â£84Â·37 in 1996, compared with Â£48Â·11in 1992. On average, that group would spend 39Â·3 per cent. of income in rent in 1996, compared with 28Â·9 per cent. in 1992, and the percentage of new working tenants spending more than one third of their income in rent would rise from 27 per cent. in 1992 to 76 per cent. in 1996. Those are staggering and depressing figures. It is clear that, with rents being pushed up to those levels, some 89 per cent. of housing association tenants moving to new lettings are expected to be people dependent on housing benefit to meet all or part of their rent. The consequences are clear. Only those people likely to be receiving housing benefit, or who are relatively well off and are able to afford large rents without assistance, would be able to consider housing association lettings. That will inevitably exclude significant numbers of people on modest incomes-in middle to low-paid work-who cannot afford the extraordinarily high cost of renting from housing associations under those terms, and who will not qualify for housing benefit towards the cost. People in need on modest incomes and in low-paid work-the very people that the tenants guarantee said should have access to housing association lettings-will be squeezed out. That is a complete and fragrant breach of the supposed tenants guarantee. Those who cannot afford to enter into housing association lettings because they qualify for housing benefit will be caught in a wretched poverty trap-unable to improve their income and living standards because they will lose almost every penny from every extra pound they earn through the withdrawal of their means-tested benefits on top of their tax and national insurance liabilities. A couple with a low income will lose 30p of every extra pound that they receive in tax and national insurance-assuming, that is, that they are subject only to the 20 per cent. tax band. That is a generous assumption, because the band is very narrow. National insurance will rise to 10 per cent. under the arrangements announced in the Budget. That will leave the couple with 70p, 65 per cent. of which will be removed by the housing benefit taper and a further 20 per cent. by the council tax taper. So 85 per cent. of that 70p will be taken away, leaving the couple with precisely 10Â·5p. If that couple are unwise enough to have children and hence to receive family credit, a further 70 per cent. of the residual 10Â·5p will be taken, leaving them just 3p from every extra pound they earn. That is a monstrous poverty trap. When the Government came to office, they complained that the richest people in Britain were subject to a penal and confiscatory tax rate of 83p in the pound; now they have created a far more penal and confiscatory framework for the lowest-paid people in employment, who depend on benefits. That cannot be right. No one in his right mind can justify creating an arrangement that catches people in such acute poverty traps, giving them no incentive to earn more: such people will lose virtually every penny they earn, through the withdrawal of means-tested benefits and tax and national insurance contributions. They are condemned to a life of benefit dependency, with no incentives. I remind the Minister that, when Labour was last in power, although income tax was higher-the standard rate was 33 per cent. rather than 25 per cent.; the lower rate also applied, but I am not taking that into account-a person in low-paid work would still have kept 37p out of every extra pound that he earned, because the reduction in benefit was so much less steep than it is now. That is a very interesting difference. Someone in low-paid work, receiving help with housing costs through housing benefit-or rent rebate, as it was then-and rate rebate, but also paying tax and national insurance, would have been subject to an income loss of 63p in the pound. Currently, the equivalent figure is 89Â·5p in the pound. The Government should be ashamed of having plunged so many low-paid people into such a poverty trap. This unhappy situation cries out for a new approach, and I have a series of specific proposals for action to tackle the problems. First-remembering the problems of mortgage arrears and repossessions-I believe that we need a mortgage benefit scheme to help home owners in low-paid work who are struggling to cope. For those who are unemployed, income support may well be available; if so, it will meet their mortgage interest payments up to a reasonable limit. But there are no arrangements to help those who are in work, even if-as is so often the case-the mortgage arrears are attributable to a reduction in earnings, perhaps when a member of the family ceased to work or went on to short-time work, or when his hours or earnings were reduced. People who are in employment, but whose earnings are reduced, will have serious difficulty in making their mortgage repayments. It is precisely those people who receive no assistance under the current arrangements. The mortgage benefit scheme, which has been researched very thoroughly for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, offers an intelligent way forward, concentrating help on those most in need. The savings that the Chancellor will make by restricting mortgage interest tax relief to 20 per cent.-that move, announced in the Budget, is very welcome-should be diverted to help the poorest home owners through a mortgage benefit scheme. Council tenants must also be liberated from the monstrously unfair housing benefit clawback. This requires a simple adjustment to the subsidy rules to exclude housing benefit from the formula, thereby putting council tenants on exactly the same footing as everyone else. Benefits to council tenants, private tenants and housing association tenants and income support for home owners should be the responsibility of society as a whole, paid for out of national taxation, not selectively offloaded on to individual sectional groups within the community. It is wrong that that should be done. That practice should be changed as soon as possible. Local authorities should be allowed once again to determine rents locally, in the light of local circumstances, rather than be forced by Government to push rents upwards, on the basis of a mechanistic Whitehall formula which, as is so often the case, bears no relationship to local reality. With private tenants, Ministers should now act on the consultation exercise that they undertook some months ago. The evidence-which I am aware of from talking to people, not just in my own constituency but in many other parts of the country-is absolutely clear: that rent levels for private tenants have been rising by unacceptably disproportionate levels, far ahead of the rate of inflation, and that they bear no relation at all to what is happening to capital values. Action is needed urgently to halt, if not reverse, the unjustified rent increases being imposed on private tenants. New guidance should be issued to rent officers and rent assessment committees. The latter are often the cause of the problem. Rent officers tell me that they often have no option but to increase rents far more than they would like because, if rents are referred to a rent assessment committee, they will simply be put up on appeal. Rent assessment committees have the unenviable reputation of being seen as the party of the landlord rather than as a group of people trying to be impartial and scrupulous and trying to find an appropriate and fair balance between the interests of the two parties. New guidance is needed to discourage these unjustified rent increases, and also proper safeguards, including appeal procedures that work for those tenants who are not in the regulated sector-tenants who have assured tenancies or assured shorthold tenancies-and who usually have no effective redress whatsoever against extortionate rents imposed and charged by their landlords. A proper mechanism for appealing against such extortionate rents and unreasonable increases is long overdue. I believe that the Government must act immediately to reverse the very damaging threat of further reductions in grant rates to housing associations. The current figure of 67 per cent. grant rates should be taken as the absolutely minimum base line, and should be increased if either construction costs or affordability problems make that necessary. The threatened reduction of grant rates to 60 per cent. and then 55 per cent. must be repudiated as yet another of our failed Chancellor's foolish foibles. He may be unable to tell his threes from his fives, but it is time that someone else in the Government-in this case, I suggest, a Department of the Environment Minister-taught the Chancellor a few basic lessons. At the same time, the Department of the Environment must come clean about affordability. For years, Ministers have talked about affordability but have never come up with any definition. We notice from other issues that Department of the Environment Ministers are all too keen to prescribe performance indicators to others. It is high time that they set a performance indicator in relation to affordability. Tenants of housing associations throughout the country deserve to know what is an affordable rent. They deserve to have the opportunity to challenge rent increases that are unreasonable and beyond the means of people in low-paid employment. To do that. it is necessary to have a clear indication and a clear definition of affordability. The Government should come clean about it. In the absence of any clear criteria and a clear definition, it is possible for people to say one thing to one group of people and something else to another group, and to preside over a framework in which rents are clearly escalating and going through the roof-far beyond the means and reach of people in low-paid employment, without their having any come-back. We need some honesty from Ministers, and we need some clear definitions of affordability. I am conscious of the fact that this debate is taking place at the end of a very long night. However, we have at least had an opportunity to air what I believe to be one of the most vital housing issues of today. I hope that, in his reply, the Minister will be able to offer some positive responses, and not just trot out the old excuses for the failure of current policies-excuses that we have heard so often. I hope he will accept that, even at this hour of the morning, lame excuses will not be good enough. We want a new approach that will bring hope to people who are desperate because of affordability problems.",13326,"['Orders Of The Day', 'Defence']",Housing,2,1,housing,3998
1993-04-01,Housing [Orders Of The Day > Defence],442,John Battle,Lab,False,"It is appropriate that this debate on affordability follows one on retirement and pensions. It is also appropriate that it should be taking place tonight, of all nights. I believe that when we look back we shall see 1 April as a key date with regard to housing and the homelessness crisis. I make that point because it is the date of the introduction of community care. That may not seem immediately relevant to affordability, but I suggest that it is indirectly relevant. From 1 April, people already in private residential care will not have the full cost of their care met; unlike those who enter homes after 1 April. In this of all years-it is the European year for solidarity between the generations-elderly people will find that, as a result of that policy, they cannot afford places in residential homes. If their families are unable to match the costs, they will have to leave and look for accommodation elsewhere, turning back to local authorities. Why? Because the housing benefit system will not cover the full cost. Similarly, in the case of community care, the discharge of people from hospitals will put pressure on housing. The Government take a good policy and, somehow, manage to turn it inside out and corrupt it. They have a knack almost of corrupting the language. The very words "" community care"" may well turn out to mean the opposite. It may well be that there is no care and that the community is not there for the provision of support. The document on community care contained the helpful words: "" Housing is the key to independent living."" That is fine, provided that there is sufficient housing. But, without a door, what use is a key? In the context of this debate, the primary concern of society must be the absolute shortage of housing to rent. The Audit Commission, the Institute of Housing and the Housing Corporation all come up with a figure of 100,000 when considering the number of units of accommodation that need to be provided each year. The Government's plans for this year may produce, at best, 53,000 new homes. There is a desperate shortage of housing to rent. For another reason, tonight is an appropriate occasion for a debate on the affordability of housing. On 31 March the Government closed the severe weather shelters. I am glad that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment is present, as he went on record in The Times, and elsewhere, in an attempt to assure us that the 400 people in the nine shelters provided as emergency accommodation throughout the winter would have places provided for them or would find spaces in the voluntary sector. On the very last day-31 March-we checked and found that 133 people in some of those nine shelters had to leave, without anywhere else to go. As we debate in this Chamber, those people are spending their night on the streets of London. That is a disgrace. Of course, we accept that it is a good policy to have severe weather shelters, but why on earth could not the Government have made provision to ensure that people being turned out had somewhere else to go? They knew who the people were. What we have is a good policy corrupted. The Government's housing policies are now effectively pricing people out of renting. They are making it impossible for many people to rent in the private sector, the local authority sector and the housing association sector. I remind the Minister that the housing association sector is only 3 per cent. of the stock, the private rented sector only 7 per cent. and the local authority sector 21 per cent. All in all, about a third of the population live in rented housing and they have a right to know whether their homes will be affordable in the years to come. I suggest that there needs to be some joined-up thinking between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Social Security. The affordability crisis in housing is also a housing benefit crisis. The Government are pursuing a low-wage policy and there is a fundamental contradiction between low wages and high rents. The Minister may reply that high rents will be met by high housing benefit. The problem is that, for some people, wages are dropping. The Government claim that the average wage is rising and that is true, but they do not seem to realise that the average rises because the highest wages go up while, at the same time, people at the bottom of the scale see their incomes declining. That is where people hit the poverty trap. The poverty trap is not for those on benefit but for those who are literally trapped between benefit and work income. They are caught coming off benefit. The Government must tackle the issue of housing benefit and the Minister should not glibly assume that social security will pay the bill. He will learn the hard way. People have to take up work-and so they should-but when they are offered a low-paid, part-time or temporary job, they will find that the income from that job will float them out of housing benefit through the tapers. They will be caught in the poverty trap because they will have to decide whether they can afford to take the job. If they cannot afford to take the job because it would mean that they were unable to pay the rent, they will face the worst double jeopardy. They will face the choice of losing their home because they cannot pay the rent or not taking a job. In other words, a work disincentive is being built into the Government's high-rent, low-wage policy. The Government also need to make it clear whether the Treasury is giving carte blanche to the housing benefit system. From some of the statements made by the Secretary of State for Social Security, I am not sure whether the benefit tapers will be changed in the next Budget in November. If the tapers are changed and the situation becomes harsher, people will receive less from the benefit system to support their rents and will be forced to pay a higher proportion of their incomes in housing costs. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) referred to the iniquitous system of local authorities effectively subsidising the income support system. When the Government ring-fenced the housing revenue accounts, that is how they insisted that the system worked. Local authority tenants not on housing benefit make up the cost of local authority tenants on housing benefit. Of course, the Government know that that is happening. That is why they have recently changed the rules for large-scale voluntary transfer. They know that the rent accounts of local councils are receiving a subsidy from tenants not on benefit to cover the deficits which the Government should be making up through housing benefit and income support. Why should some council tenants be subsidising the housing benefit of others, who ought to get proper support through the social security system? In other words, other renters are being forced to subsidise the income support system rather than the housing system. That is iniquitous and unjust. The Government recognised that fact in connection with large-scale voluntary transfer, which is why they changed the rules for that and introduced the levy. They should scrap the system now and return to local authorities the money that is due for paying out full housing benefit. The Government are still operating a policy of pricing people out of renting local authority properties unless they are on high or medium wages. There is almost a deliberate edge, to force people to buy by pricing them out of renting. The guidelines set by the Government for local authority rent increases this year assume a 9 per cent. increase. That is well above the rate of inflation, yet those are the costs that tenants are asked to pay; that is the money that local authorities have to raise to balance their housing revenue accounts. On 24 March my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) asked the Secretary of State "" what assessment he has made as to the likely effect on the building of houses by housing associations of the reduction of housing association grants."" The Minister for Housing and Planning replied: "" Increasing the private finance input into housing association schemes enables us to produce significantly greater numbers of new homes with the available public resources. The reduction in the average housing association grant for rented schemes from 72 per cent. in 1992-93 to 67 per cent. in 1993-94 was achieved through lower costs without any significant impact on the affordability of rents implied.""- A lot of meaning must be attached to the little word "" implied"". It is not the view of housing associations or their tenants that there has been no significant impact on affordability. There has indeed been a significant impact and not only I but many other hon. Members, including Conservative Members, are receiving letters from tenants in housing associations saying that they are finding it difficult to meet their rents. On 24 March the National Federation of Housing Associations launched its affordability campaign, because it believes that the affordability crisis is now undermining housing association provision of housing to rent. If the housing associations constitute the only social rented sector that the Government are prepared to support, where does the Minister expect people to go if he prices them out of housing association properties? Even the Government's 1988 deregulation of the private rented sector did not revive it; there has been no substantial increase in properties available for private renting. There is a massive shortage of properties in the public, council rented sector. If people cannot afford their housing association flats and houses, where are they to move to? Where else can they go? The housing associations' campaign on affordability points out that since 1989 housing association grants, the Government subsidy to housing association development, had been fixed at an average level of 75 per cent. throughout the country, but that in 1992-93 it fell to 72 per cent. and that it is now scheduled to fall to 67 per cent. But in the Department of the Environment's public expenditure announcement following the autumn statement the Government set an objective of reducing the grant to 60 per cent. in 1994-95 and to 55 per cent. in 1995-96. The Government have not previously set grant rates for subsequent years. In a parliamentary reply on 24 March to a question from me suggesting that grants were projected to drop to those rates, the Minister said that it was alarmist propaganda. If he believes that the public expenditure statements of the Department of the Environment are alarmist propaganda, he should eat his own words, because it is there in black and white. It says that that is the Government's objective. In a speech at the London School of Economics the Housing Minister confirmed that that reduction in grant rates was his objective. The consequences of the reduction in grant rates will be higher rents, the growth of dependency of housing association tenants on housing benefit, housing association revenue streams increasingly dependent on housing benefit and difficulties faced by housing associations in sustaining levels of private finance. If the grant rate changes take place, it is estimated that housing associations will need to raise an extra Â£400 million in private finance in 1995-96 simply to maintain a stable programme. Have the Government done the arithmetic on that? Do they believe that they can raise that money? Will not the Minister concede that it is an unrealistic additional amount for housing associations to find? What will happen? There will be a vicious circle of higher rents, housing benefit dependency and reduced loan security, all as a result of a reduction in grant rates in the Government's attempt to push the housing association movement further in the direction of raising private finance. The National Federation of Housing Associations commissioned UBS Phillips and Drew to forecast the factors that are incorporated into the grant rate and the total cost indicator systems which govern the costs and rents of housing association production. The calculations based on those forecasts are that rents are likely to increase by a further 70 per cent. on average and dependency on housing benefit will increase to 85 per cent. of housing association tenants. It will be 90 per cent. for two-parent households. Such percentages of incomes spent on housing costs are well beyond what is expected anywhere else in the world. The OECD suggested that if a person or a family spent more than 30 per cent. of income on housing costs, there would not be sufficient left to feed and clothe themselves, apart from the cost of travel to work. The Government have not revealed their estimate of an acceptable percentage of income to spend on housing costs, but the Treasury has assumed a figure of 34Â·7 per cent. since 1989. Under the proposals for one parents and single people, that figure will be over 40 per cent. For pensioner households the position will be even worse. If grant rates drop to 55 per cent., according to the UBS Phillips and Drew survey, pensioner couples will spend 45 per cent. of their income on rent and single pensioners 52 per cent. Single people under 25 will pay 48 per cent. Those levels are unsustainable. I hope that the Minister has seen the background briefing notes of the National Federation of Housing Associations which give figures based on the federation's continuous recording of lettings data on new tenants supplied by the associations that make up the federation. They show that 76 per cent. of new working tenants will spend more than one third of their income on rent. The question that must be asked is: in those circumstances, how could the new rents be considered affordable on any reasonable interpretation of the word? Working households becoming association tenants will face an average rent of Â£84Â·37 in 1996, compared with Â£48Â·11 in 1992. On average that group will be spending 39Â·3 per cent. of their income on rent in 1996, compared with 28Â·9 per cent. in 1992. In other words, the percentage of new working tenants who spend more than a third of their incomes on rent will rise from 27 per cent. in 1992 to 76 per cent. in 1996. Is that the Government's intention? If so, the only conclusion is that they assume that the bill will be picked up by the Department of Social Security in housing benefit, because 89 per cent. of new tenants will be on full or partial benefit. I should be interested to know whether the Department of the Environment and the Housing Minister have clearance from the Secretary of State for Social Security to escalate housing benefit in such a way. If 89 per cent. of all new housing association tenants moving into new homes in 1966 are on housing benefit because of the change in grant rates-reducing them to 55 per cent.-they will qualify for weekly housing benefit of Â£30Â·72 in 1996, compared with Â£13Â·28 in 1992. In that case, the Government will have to pay drastically more in housing benefit. When we look at the annual report of the Department of the Environment, we find that the increase in housing benefit for private tenants and housing association tenants in the past 12 months is incredible. I cannot see the Treasury allowing the Department of the Environment to get away with a policy of simply saying that it will jack up the rents and the Department of Social Security will pick up the bill. I suspect that the Government will start to claw it back. If everyone is pushed into housing benefit, the question again arises: in those circumstances, is it worth new tenants having a job? In other words, if they are offered a job, they are put in the real dilemma of having to refuse it because they will not be able to make up the difference between the high rent and what they would have got on housing benefit. Pensioners will face worse affordability problems. In 1991-92, pensioner households, except housing association lettings, paid an average of 38 per cent. of their net incomes in gross rent, compared with 25 per cent. for households under pensioner age. We all know that, because pensioners who visit our surgeries or write to us often set out their payments in detail. They can tell us their weekly milk bills. They do the arithmetic because they must pay the price of increasing bills. Pensioners will be hard-pressed if rents increase in this way because not all of them are on full housing benefit: some get a modest supplementary pension which, effectively, eliminates them from access to housing benefit. They then have to find the rent. Pensioner households pay higher average weekly gross rents than non-pensioner ones-in 1991-92, the figure was Â£42Â·49 compared with Â£38Â·30. Are the Government suggesting that housing associations will provide welfare housing with a vengeance only for those on housing benefit? The trend is already shifting in that direction because 70 per cent. of tenants in housing associations are on benefit, compared with about 66 per cent. of council tenants. If they are saying that, there is another twist because the housing will be available only for pensioners on housing benefit. If unemployed people on benefit are offered a job, they must accept it, regardless of how low paid it is, or they will lose the benefit. That is the new trap under the social security rules. The double-jeopardy is that, if people accept a part-time, temporary, low-paid job, it may float them out of a benefit but not give them sufficient to make up the difference in rent and they will have to move out. Even for the elderly, a bit of supplementary pension from a partner could mean that housing association properties will need notes in the windows saying "" DSS only apply"", which we have seen previously. If people cannot guarantee that they are on full housing benefit, they will not be able to afford the rent. So what is the future of housing associations? The Mail on Sunday on 21 February said: "" Private developers could be given Government cash to build low-cost homes for homeless and poor families. Ministers may allow builders to compete with housing associations for a slice of Â£2 billion of Whitehall funding. Tory MPs pushing for the change are concerned that housing associations are failing to give value for money. They believe that savings could be made by 'cutting out the middleman' and funding developers directly. They argue that private developers could build more homes with the money through greater expertise and lower costs."" The hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Sir P. Beresford) said in the article: "" I understand from the private sector that value for money is not being given. Many of the builders concerned claim they could build more homes for the same costs."" I should like the Minister to confirm whether that is Government policy. Does he see the housing association grant going directly to the builders when it drops to 55 per cent? So the great honeymoon of the housing association world which the Government supported seems to be coming to a close. What are the Government's intentions for the housing association world? Do they see it having a future, providing what they would describe as "" socially rented housing"", or do they see the grant going direct to the builders to provide more housing at lower cost? The race for market rents was set off by the Housing Act 1988, which was to free the private rented sector. I remember asking the Housing Minister during proceedings on that Bill whether he had persuaded the Department of Social Security to agree to underwrite the housing benefit bill if landlords decided simply to jack up the rents and charge what they wanted. I remember the Minister saying that of course landlords could not put the rent up to Â£100 or Â£150 a week and simply claim that the person was on housing benefit. What have we seen happen? We were given another notion-market rents. What do we get now? Week after week, I receive scores of letters from people who went to the rent assessment committee because the landlord proposed to increase their rent and found that the committee agreed to increase the rent by even more. What is happening in the private rented sector is exactly what was predicted would happen. Rents are going through the roof. So far, the Government simply say that it is deregulation and that those who cannot afford rents can obtain housing benefit. How long will it be, I am worried to ask, before the Treasury cuts the housing benefit bill? Will it be in November, when the tapers are reduced, that people are told that they have to pay more rent? I conclude with a remark that the Minister made to me when I put it to him in environment questions on 24 March that the housing association grant reduction would cause real hardship. He replied: "" I reject the alarmist propaganda that the hon. Gentleman has just revealed to the House.""- Is the UBS Phillips and Drew survey alarmist? Are the housing associations being alarmist? They tell the truth about the arithmetic and who will pay the price if the Government press ahead with their proposal. When we talk about propaganda, the Minister should look at his Department's news releases, in particular the one of 18 March which committed the Government to spending Â£1Â·4 million on an advertising scheme to remind tenants of their right to buy. The news release which relaunched the campaign said: "" Many council tenants could find that the costs of buying compare very well with the costs of renting. In fact, an average Right to Buy mortgage repayment will be less than the average rent as from April."" Of course it will if the rents are increased to price people out into taking on mortgages. I suggest to the Minister that that statement says a lot more about the increasing costs of renting than about the availability of cheap mortgages. That is the problem. When we have a Government abolishing wages councils and driving wages down, of course the rents will be beyond people's means and the equations start to look different. The Minister says in page 3 of the press release: "" Rents however have risen and now average rents are Â£33Â·00 a week (expected figure for April 1993) or Â£145 per calendar month. So mortgage costs could in fact now be less than renting costs."" I am tempted to add that it is almost like an advertisement for a timeshare. It is certainly not a commitment to a decent, affordable renting policy; it is simply suggesting that people should get out of renting and take themselves into mortgages as quickly as possible. There we have it. That is the real propaganda, the real direction of Government policy. There is a fundamental contradiction between a Government's economic policy developing a low-wage economy and a Department of the Environment insisting on high rents. We need more rented housing; that has to be the primary position; but we also need to tackle affordability, or, in effect, people will be priced out of renting. If the Government pursue the present policies in the public sector, the housing associations and the private sector, people will be priced out of renting. The only conclusion can be an increase in homelessness as people try to live with others, on sofas and floors, or take to the streets. What worries me is that this time it could mean homelessness among the elderly on a scale which, so far, our society fortunately has not had to face. That might sound alarmist to the Minister, but I suggest that he does his homework on the figures. The Government could, and should, act now to pre-empt that potential scandal. The primary need is for homes to rent. The Government should ensure that people can afford to pay their rent according to their real income and means; if they do not, they will be culpably compounding the homelessness crisis and rendering the word affordability totally void of meaning.",13326,"['Orders Of The Day', 'Defence']",Housing,2,2,housing,4085

The private sector declined from the first world war onwards because of rent controls which artificially kept down the return that landlords were able to make upon their investment-rent controls that were maintained by successive Labour Governments, which effectively destroyed the private rented sector. It has only been since the 1988 housing legislation, when we freed rents to proper market levels, that we have begun to see, for the first time for many decades, a private rented sector in which new tenancies equal those that are falling in.",13326,"['Orders Of The Day', 'Defence']",Housing,2,6,housing,98
1993-04-01,Housing [Orders Of The Day > Defence],447,Tony Baldry,Con,False,"No. I have listened to a lot from the hon. Gentlemen. They have both made very long speeches. They have both made a lot of points to which they want me to respond. It is a complex subject, and one on which I wish to respond in my own time and in my own way. To begin with, housing is not, like some other goods such as education or health services, predominantly a public sector matter. Most households prefer to own their own homes, and a major element of our housing policies has been focused on enabling them to do so. The right to buy for council housing, and now our rents-to-mortgages proposals; cash incentive schemes to enable public sector tenants to move out into owner-occupation; shared ownership schemes-these are all important parts of our commitment to empower those who want to own their own homes to do just that. With affordability levels high, with mortgage rates at their lowest for 25 years, and with some impressive fixed rate mortgage deals on offer, now is an excellent time for those thinking about buying into the market to do so. Not every household will want, or be able to afford, owner-occupation, so our policies also address the demand for rented accommodation; but here as well we must remember that housing for rent is not a public sector monopoly; although the private rented sector has been a declining force in housing provision throughout the century, there is now evidence of an increase in private lettings in response to the measures we have taken to encourage the private rented sector. Housing benefit means that tenants who rent from private owners are not left on their own if they face difficulty in meeting their housing costs. Therefore, the question of affordability in the social housing sector is not something which can be treated in isolation. Not only do we need to remember the interaction with the other housing sectors; we also need to consider what the nation as a whole can afford to spend on housing programmes; to make sure that what we can afford is targeted as closely as possible on those in the greatest need; and to use it as efficiently as possible. In the local authority sector, we have intentionally been moving towards a more market-based system of rents, where the rent the authority charges reflects the value of a letting. Instead of subsidising the bricks and mortar of the property itself, we have been subsidising the people who matter-individual tenants. That approach means that where local authority tenants can afford to pay more towards their housing costs, they do so. In the past, there has been a great deal of emphasis on keeping down gross rents. However, that policy has produced some pretty odd results. In the local authority sector, rents have tended to reflect historic investment costs and arbitrary decisions on rent levels by local authorities rather than the intrinsic value of the housing on offer. Thus, it has been common for local authorities to charge a high rent for a virtually uninhabitable system-built flat simply because the investment was recent and the debt charges high, and a much lower rent for a pleasant, traditional older house built some time ago. It is no wonder that some estates have been hard to let. As well as relative rents being out of line with reality, the average level of all gross local authority rents had reached an artifically low level by the time we took office in 1979, so we have been pursuing a policy of gradually increasing local authority rents in real terms. Ring-fencing the housing revenue account has put an end to arbitrary subsidies to or from the ratepayer or council tax payer, and by shifting subsidy from bricks and mortar to people, we achieve a fairer distribution of the available subsidy. The increases have not been severe, as we accept that tenants who do not receive housing benefit need to be protected from too steep a withdrawal of the subsidy to their rents. In order to move towards a more rational pattern of local authority rents, we have been targeting our guideline rent increases according to the capital value of different local authority housing stocks, so the authorities with the most valuable stocks are those that increase their rents the most. We have also encouraged all authorities to move towards a more rational pattern of rent among their different properties-a pattern that reflects the value rather than the cost of different local authority homes. A tenant who is unable to meet the full cost of the rent gets means-related help from the housing benefit system. Some 70 per cent. of local authority rent increases are met by rent rebates. Since 1989, local authorities have faced the discipline of the ring-fenced housing revenue account. It increases the focus on the delivery of housing management services, which are properly chargeable to rents. It means that authorities cannot bail out an inefficient housing operation at the expense of the local council tax payer, as too many did in the past. The need to make sure that rental income, together with the support we provide through the housing revenue account subsidy, meet outgoings provides a vital check. I make no apology for moving the subsidy away from the buildings and towards the people who live in them; and away from the suppliers and towards their customers. That is a crucial step towards a more efficient local authority housing sector. As local authorities grow into their role as enablers, and as the pressures of compulsory competitive tendering for housing management improve performance, I hope to see further improvements over the coming years. While local authorities account for the bulk of the existing social rented sector, they are, of course, no longer the main suppliers of new social housing for rent. That role has been taken on by the housing associations, which have been able to make use of private finance to ensure that the funds they receive from the Government through the Housing Corporation are translated into the maximum number of good-quality homes. Since 1988, public spending on housing association grant has been supplemented by more than Â£2 billion of private sector finance-a clear gain to housing output at a time of public spending restraint. That large sum of private finance has enabled a great deal of additional investment in social housing to take place. The average housing association grant rate for this year is 72 per cent. Private finance enables a third more homes to be built with the available public money than would otherwise be so. For 1993-94, grant rates have been reduced, without any impact on rents, because of competititive prices and low interest rates. Our manifesto promised 153,000 new homes to rent over a period of three years. I am confident that we shall do much better than that, partly because of the housing market package announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in November. I shall outline the outstanding success of that package in a moment. The private funding that housing associations can raise, however, also makes a vital contribution. The reductions achieved this year through lower interest rates and competitive prices have enabled us to reduce the rate of housing association grant from 72 to 67 per cent. without any significant impact on the affordability of the rents implied by those grant rates. That has improved output-an extra 3,300 new homes provided this year as a result of the increase in private sector funds levered in. We must strike a balance between rent levels and the number of homes provided. There is no magic wand that we can wave to make it possible to provide decent homes more cheaply. If we choose to provide subsidy at a higher level, we must forgo the extra output, which, I am sure that hon. Members would agree, is badly wanted by those in unsatisfactory accommodation. As with local authority tenants, it is only those on incomes high enough to be outside the housing benefit system who will face the full impact of higher rents. It is, of course, important that they do not face unfair rises or increases that are too steep. Where resources are available to tackle housing need, it must be right that we increasingly move towards directing them, through the housing benefit system for poorer tenants, at those who have the greatest need, and make new homes available to those who are not satisfactorily housed. Housing associations have been able to take advantage of low interest rates and low building costs to build more homes and house more people. Opposition Members will hear concerns about affordability from housing associations-as I frequently do. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) referred to the lobbying that housing associations have been carrying out in recent days. What is most significant and at the crux of the debate-although housing associations have not made it clear in their various representations-is that this year, at a time when those associations have been expressing concern about affordability and the housing association grant rate, those self-same associations have put forward more than four and a half times the number of schemes that can be supported by the resources available for this year. At those grant rates, their bids have been four and a half times the amount of the money available. That clearly suggests that, whatever concerns they may express in public, housing associations have confidence in their ability to make use of the resources available at those grant rates and to achieve the higher outputs that we have sought. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) argued that 67 per cent. was the minimum grant rate that it was possible to sustain. I simply invite him to explain how, when housing associations are bidding at levels of four and a half times the money available through existing grant rates, one can possibly justify saying that 67 per cent. is the absolute minimum for housing association grant.",13326,"['Orders Of The Day', 'Defence']",Housing,2,7,housing,1675
1993-04-01,Housing [Orders Of The Day > Defence],448,Nick Raynsford,Lab,False,"Will the Minister answer the following question, which will help him to resolve the question that he has put to me? Has the Housing Corporation-which, as he knows, recommends to Ministers the appropriate grant rate for housing associations-recommended the reduction of grant rates from 72 to 67 per cent? If it did not, the Minister will have to explain to the House why he and his colleagues ignored the advice of the Housing Corporation, which was concerned about the affordability problems that were being caused by reducing grant rates.",13326,"['Orders Of The Day', 'Defence']",Housing,2,8,housing,89
1993-04-01,Housing [Orders Of The Day > Defence],449,Tony Baldry,Con,False,"Before I answer that question, the Official Report will show that the hon. Gentleman completely ducked and evaded the question that I asked him, which is the core question. I will answer his question about the advice from the Housing Corporation as it raises the issue contained in his speech-and about which he has been muttering sotto voce ever since-about whether we would contemplate increasing the housing association grant rate. We have repeatedly made it clear that, year on year, we make no final decisions about the grant rate until we have all the evidence and advice, which obviously includes advice that we receive from the Housing Corporation. This year, I suspect that it will also include the advice that may be offered by the Select Committee on the Environment, of which the hon. Gentleman is a member and which is currently conducting a study into the Housing Corporation and its work. We have made no shadow of a secret of the fact that our objective is to increase the proportion of private financing put into new schemes in future by reducing grant rates to 60 per cent. in 1994-95, in line with the wider initiatives to expand the role of private finance announced in the autumn statement. But final decisions will be taken only when we have assessed the likely impact on housing associations' ability to raise the private finance necessary. Those decisions are taken year on year, and they will be taken against the background of that available information. Within that context, the Housing Corporation's advice will always be listened to carefully, as it was last year, but we will also bear in mind the need to make sure that the resources available go, as far as possible, towards helping those who need a home. With a finite amount of capital for investment, we have to examine the trade-off between how much we can do and how much we ask tenants to pay for it. At whatever level of capital spending, we are forced to choose between building fewer homes with lower rents or more homes with higher rents. Some large numbers are involved in that trade-off. Quite small reductions in the subsidy that we pay to suppliers of housing association homes, in the case of new housing, can have a major impact on output. This year's reductions in average housing association grant level by just 5 per cent. will enable an extra 3,300 homes to be built. In that case, rents will not have to rise, because the grant rate reductions have been made possible by cost savings. If we had followed the policies advocated by the Opposition, those extra houses would never have been built. Recently, there have been some encouraging signs emerging from the statistics of families accepted as homeless by local authorities. The number of homelessness acceptances in 1992 was 2 per cent. less than in the previous year-the first year-on-year reduction. The signs on the use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation are even more encouraging, with only 7,500 households housed there by local authorities, compared with more than 12,000 a year ago, and that is a drop of 38 per cent. We hope that, as the new homes made available through the housing market passage come on stream, the figures will continue their current hopeful trends. I am happy to be able to tell the House that the housing market package has exceeded our expectations, and I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate all those who have been involved on the work they have done. Around 18,000 homes for rent will be made available in England, well exceeding the target of 16,000; grants to local authority and housing association tenants will enable some 3,500 households to move into the owner-occupied sector, freeing their current homes for those in need. The 80 housing associations involved deserve great credit for their achievement. What they had to undertake was not inconsiderable within the time scale, and purchases have been made right across the country in almost all local authority areas, making a vital contribution towards meeting housing need, and often bringing on significant numbers of new houses for rent within particular areas. However, we shall never allow ourselves to become complacent. Homelessness is still a significant problem, which demands tough decisions on how we use the resources at our disposal. The families who are still in unsatisfactory bed-and-breakfast accommodation, and who need a home of their own to give them a chance to bring up their children in the way they would want, will not thank us if we allow concern for existing tenants who are already comfortably housed, and who can afford to pay a little more towards the cost of their housing, to dominate our thinking at the expense of building new homes. It is not just those who are unsatisfactorily housed in temporary accommodation who should be at the front of our minds. We must also remember the needs of those who have no home at all. Our rough sleepers initiative has made a significant impact on the problem of rough sleeping in central London. We have spent over Â£96 million. That money will provide nearly 1,000 hostel bedspaces, 700 places in flats and houses leased from the private sector, and more than 2,000 places in permanent move-on accommodation. The hon. Member for Leeds, West made various assertions alleging that those who had been housed in rough weather shelters had not been provided with accommodation when they left. His figures are badly wrong. Only about 10 people were refused further accommodation, but I do not intend to have a spat about that at this early hour in the morning. I will arrange to have the information that we have made available in the Official Report so that it can be seen on the record, and there can be no doubt of the success of those involved in those schemes. These measures have been having success. Independent research suggests that the number of people sleeping rough in central London has more than halved from its level of three years ago. We need to do what we can to ensure that the figures continue to reduce, and it is vital that all the agencies concerned with rough sleepers co-operate to achieve that end. At Lincoln's Inn fields, for example, Camden council, the Government, and voluntary organisations have co-operated to ensure that everybody formerly living there was offered alternative accommodation. Tackling rough sleeping is not a simple task. It requires close co-ordination between central Government and local government, housing associations, and voluntary groups, to ensure that the needs of those sleeping rough are tackled in the round, and to make sure that rough sleepers have the opportunity to start a new life with more secure housing. The work of the rough sleepers initiative is not just the work of central Government; it depends on all the agencies involved working together with those who need shelter to find the right solutions. I have talked about the needs of those who are without a proper permanent home to emphasise that, when we talk about affordability, we need to remember the purpose of our housing policy. It is to ensure that a decent home is in reach of every family. That is not wishful thinking-it is a substantial commitment-but it involves hard choices. It requires us to make sure that the resources that we can afford as a nation are targeted as closely as possible on the real problems, and on those in greatest need, and we are determined to do that.",13326,"['Orders Of The Day', 'Defence']",Housing,2,9,housing,1263

1995-06-27,Housing [Oral Answers To Questions > Prime Minister],142,John Gummer,Con,False,"With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make a statement about our housing policies. The Government are today publishing the White Paper, "" Our Future Homes"". Copies will be available immediately after this statement in the Library and the Vote Office. Home ownership, opportunity in renting and unlocking resources to provide help where it is needed-those are the hallmarks of the Government's housing policies and have been since 1979. The objective of our housing policy is that a decent home should be within reach of every family. A population living longer and staying longer in their homes, together with the breakdown of traditional family structures, means that there will be an increasing demand for homes. We live in a heavily populated country, yet we shall have to meet the demand for new homes in an environmentally sustainable way. The public sector needs to look for new and imaginative ways in which to work with the private sector to achieve our aims. The proposals that I am putting forward today embody three themes: opportunity, choice and responsibility. Those are things that people value. We remain committed to continued sustainable growth in home ownership. Home ownership is what 80 per cent. of people want. More than 4 million households in addition have become home owners since 1979. Over the next 10 years, our aim is that 1.5 million more families will own their own homes. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has today underlined our commitment by reaffirming that there will be no cut in the tax relief on mortgage interest for the rest of this Parliament. Now we want to go further and give more people the opportunity to buy. First, we propose to introduce a new voluntary grant scheme, to give housing association tenants cash help to buy the homes that they live in. Housing associations will receive the full market price and will be able to keep the receipt from the sale to build a new home. Secondly, we propose to legislate to make it a condition of future grant to social landlords that landlords-including housing associations-commit themselves to making the new houses and flats available for sale to tenants on request. Again, sales will be at full market price, with grant to tenants to help them buy. Thirdly, we shall challenge private developers, public bodies and housing associations to bring forward development proposals for support from English Partnerships to build on derelict land, to bring more home ownership into the heart of our cities, building healthier, more balanced communities. We shall also change the renovation grants system to allow a more strategic approach in providing help to low-income home owners, including elderly people and people with disabilities, for essential improvements and adaptations to their homes. We shall have a discretionary system, except for grants for disabled people, which will remain mandatory. Of course, we realise the real difficulties that are currently being faced by some home owners. Our objective must continue to be sustainable home ownership, able to cope with changing economic conditions. Sustaining a healthy private rented sector is the second key element in providing people with choices and opportunities. In 1988, we removed the controls that were strangling that sector. Since then, we have seen its steady growth from 1.7 million to 2 million homes. Now we want to do more to unlock new resources. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes to legislate to allow the creation of housing investment trusts, to encourage financial institutions to invest. They will benefit from a reduced rate of corporation tax and exemptions from tax on capital gains. We propose to legislate to help small landlords, by simplifying letting arrangements and making it easier to evict tenants who do not pay the rent. We propose to legislate to improve the safety and fitness of houses in multiple occupation. I intend to strengthen the powers already available to local authorities, particularly in respect of ensuring adequate fire precautions in high-risk houses in multiple occupation. Those proposals will, I believe, sustain the growth in private renting that has been achieved under this Government. Our White Paper also reaffirms our commitment to maintaining a social rented sector at rents below market levels. Affordable rents mean that people have real incentives to work and to save. On current plans, the Government will provide 180,000 additional social rented lettings in three years. Now we need to look for yet more ways to increase investment through partnership with the private sector, to extend choice and to improve further the service provided to tenants. We propose to legislate to allow commercial providers to compete alongside housing associations for grants to provide social housing at below market rents, increasing competition so that we can get more homes for taxpayers' money. Opposition Members who do not want more homes for taxpayers' money are letting down not the Government, but the people who would otherwise be provided with decent homes. We shall introduce a system to ensure that all new social sector landlords are delivering the required level of service to tenants. There will be no question of operating on an unequal playing field. There is considerable potential for using large-scale voluntary transfers of local authority stock to help wider regeneration in urban areas. We shall be encouraging transfers-if the tenants agree-in cases where there are benefits for tenants through increased investment, as well as a reduction in the burden on taxpayers. Where there are costs, we shall support transfers that offer the best return on the resources that we have available. We shall encourage transfer to a wider range of private landlords. That could include local housing companies, as well as commercial landlords. Local authority companies will need to be clearly in the private sector. By 2005, we intend to transform the remaining large- For the first time, a Government have committed themselves to transform all the worst housing estates in Britain and the only thing that the Opposition can do is laugh, for they have no policy and cannot face the realities of Britain's housing problems. Opposition Members who care only for party political slogans and do not care to improve the housing of the people of Britain can go on giggling into the next century, for we have work to do. We shall bring together resources to deal with the worst social, economic and housing problems. Within this decade, we shall see to it that families are no longer brought up in the dispiriting and destructive environment that pervades our worst estates-in councils largely run by the Labour party and where the quality of housing is a standing disgrace to that party throughout the land. It is the Opposition whose rent policies have meant that they have been unable to keep up the decent housing to which the electorate lay claim. We shall meet housing demand while protecting the environment. We have set ourselves targets for England for the next 10 years, to which Opposition Members on the Front Bench would do well to listen. The first is to reduce the percentage of empty homes in the public and private sectors to 3 per cent. of stock. The second is to reduce the number of Government-owned empty homes, selling off surplus empty homes within six months of their becoming empty. The third is to build half of all new homes on previously developed land, reducing building on green-field sites, protecting the environment and safeguarding the green belt. We need to ensure that social housing is allocated fairly to those with the best claim to it. In July 1994, we announced that we would proceed with plans to reform homelessness legislation and make the system of allocating social housing fairer- -not something with which the Labour Front Bench appears to bother.

1995-06-27,Housing [Oral Answers To Questions > Prime Minister],145,John Gummer,Con,False,"We need to ensure that social housing is allocated fairly to those with the best claim to it. In July 1994, we announced that we would proceed with plans to reform homelessness legislation and to make the system of allocating social housing a fairer one. The White Paper confirms our commitment to legislating on that. These reforms will put all those with a long-term need for social housing on the same footing, while ensuring that there is a safety net for emergency and pressing needs. Too often, people who fit the statutory categories get a house before people on the waiting list, who have put up with long-term housing problems but do not happen to fit those categories. Local authorities will have greater flexibility to decide what is the best housing solution for people in need of help, in the light of circumstances in their area and of the particular circumstances of the individuals concerned. To help prevent homelessness, we shall legislate to ensure that suitable housing advice services are available in each local authority area. There will also be more help to low-income households to find a home, through pre-tenancy determinations of housing benefit for those renting in the private sector, and through powers for local authorities to provide rent guarantees. Sleeping rough on the streets is the most visible form of homelessness. The Government's rough sleepers initiative in central London, which will have invested Â£182 million of public money over the six years to March 1996, has been highly effective. We shall build on that success to ensure that there is no necessity for people to sleep rough. In central London, we shall continue the rough sleepers initiative beyond March 1996, including the funding for people who do the hard job of working with the most difficult of cases out there on the streets. We shall also fund resettlement work and an annual winter shelter programme, and shall consider the need for funding for some temporary direct access hostel provision. Outside central London, we shall consider assisting the development of the rough sleepers initiative model in areas where rough sleeping is demonstrated to be a major problem. We want a better service for tenants in the social rented sector. We have given tenants a wide range of rights so that they have a bigger say in how their homes are run, and so that services are more responsive to local needs. Those changes appear in the council tenants charter, a new and improved version of which we published last week. However, tenants have not only important rights but important responsibilities, such as to stick to tenancy agreements, to pay the rent, and not to annoy other tenants. Sadly, there is a small minority of tenants whose selfish behaviour makes their neighbours' lives a misery, and we want to help local authorities to deal more effectively with anti-social behaviour. Our proposal is for probationary tenancies, so that local authorities can improve the quality of life for the responsible majority of tenants by taking firm action against the irresponsible minority. What is proposed is a balanced, sensible package that encourages private initiative and investment, and will promote competition to increase value for taxpayers' money. The package is designed to deliver genuine opportunity and to support individual responsibility, while recognising the responsibility of Government to provide effective help for those who need it. Our policies are set out in full in the White Paper. A number of detailed consultation papers are also being published either today or over the next few weeks.

1995-06-27,Housing [Oral Answers To Questions > Prime Minister],146,Frank Dobson,Lab,False,"From that statement, one would never guess the scale of the housing crisis now harming the lives of families in every part of the country, whether they are owner-occupiers, whether they are renting or whether they are simply trying to get somewhere decent to live. After 16 years in office, the Government have produced a White Paper that neither addresses the immediate problems that millions of people face nor spells out a vision for a future in which everyone in Britain has a decent home. The White Paper is the product of a Government who have run out of ideas, and who now appear to be living in a world of their own. They have now started ignoring problems in the hope that people will not notice what has gone wrong or who is to blame. The White Paper does nothing to restore faith in the mortgage market, and little or nothing to end the crisis in housing investment. It does nothing to help the homeless or people living in overcrowded accommodation. Indeed, it is all too likely to make matters worse. As the White Paper has not dealt with many of the problems that people face, I shall put the following specific questions to the Secretary of State. First, will he confirm that despite the one and a quarter million families in negative equity, the half a million families in mortgage arrears and the one third of a million families whose homes have been repossessed in the past five years, his statement did not mention the word "" repossession"", and the White Paper mentions it only once-and certainly does not come up with any answers? Will the right hon. Gentleman also confirm that despite the Tory general election promise to retain mortgage tax relief, that too has been cut, and that even the promises announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer are current only this side of the next general election? Will he confirm that, for every family with serious mortgage arrears in 1982, there are now 21 families with serious arrears, and that for every family whose home was repossessed in 1979, 16 families had their homes repossessed last year? Is not the Secretary of State ashamed that the number of homes being built for rent by housing associations and councils this year is less than 20,000-the lowest since the second world war? Is it not the case that, for every home being built for rent this year, seven were being built under the previous Labour Government and that, under this Government, rents are rising at four or five times the rate of inflation? Will he confirm that, despite a record number of houses in disrepair, he proposes to end families' rights to renovation grants? Will he explain where he expects the homeless to go when their temporary right to accommodation runs out, especially as fewer homes are available for rent? How will making it easier for private landlords to evict tenants reduce homelessness? Why does he think that a licensing scheme to improve the safety of homes in multiple occupation would amount to "" over-regulation and bureaucracy"", as stated in the White Paper? If, as the Secretary of State intends, council housing is to be transferred to private companies, how does he intend to keep rents down, and who will meet the cost of keeping rents down? Why does he refuse to allow councils to start investing in new homes the takings from the right-to-buy sale of council houses? Finally, will the Secretary of State confirm that, despite anything that the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said at his press conference this morning, when the right hon. Gentleman was Secretary of State for Wales, he approved every word of this housing White Paper, which means that both candidates for the Conservative party leadership are totally responsible for this feeble and useless document?",19500,"['Oral Answers To Questions', 'Prime Minister']",Housing,2,5,housing,647

Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) can bring forward.

In each of the previous 16 years we have been in exactly the same position: every new idea comes from the Conservatives, while every carping criticism comes from the Opposition, who still have no ideas. Moreover, the hon. Gentleman still does not understand that if private landlords are not allowed to run the homes that they let reasonably, there will be no homes to let. The last time that the Labour party placed heavy restrictions on private landlords, it lost 500,000 letting homes. We now insist that if private landlords receive help from the Government to provide homes below market rents, they must meet the same requirements that are placed on housing associations. The hon. Gentleman has clearly not even read the White Paper, despite the fact that he has had an advantage over many hon. Members for several days. It is difficult to take the hon. Gentleman's attack on the Government's housing policy when every day we sell 200 houses to people who were previously in rented accommodation in the public sector. So 200 families a day are buying their own homes through the right to buy, an organisation and system that the Opposition have opposed tooth and nail throughout their period in opposition. In addition, we are building, renovating and improving lettings for those who need supported housing at a rate of 60,000 a year. That is a significant addition to the homes available to those who need subsidised and supported housing. Once again, the hon.

It would be a great encouragement to those who want to buy their homes if mortgage interest relief at source-MIRAS-was increased from 15 per cent. to 25 per cent., not least for first-time buyers, in order to give greater confidence and to stimulate home ownership. Secondly, would my right hon.

In the end, that will mean that more trouble is stored up for the future.

Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) that if MIRAS was increased as he suggested, the difference would amount to Â£10 a month. The real difference is achieved by getting the inflation rate down, keeping it down and, therefore, keeping mortgage repayments down. The policy of the hon. Lady's party would push inflation and mortgage rates up. Her party's policy and the extra taxation needed to fund what she claims she would do would create unsustainable housing.

1997-11-12,Housing,37,David Drew,Lab,False,"I am grateful for the opportunity to debate one of the biggest issues that face us as we enter the next millennium: where people are going to live. I do not intend to speak for long, because I know how many other hon. Members wish to speak. On entering the House, I was somewhat surprised to find how little national debate there had been about this subject, despite the last Government's paper entitled "" Household growth: where shall we live?"" and a report on housing need by the Environment Select Committee. Given its importance and relevance to every constituency, and therefore to every Member of Parliament, it is surprising what a low public profile the issue has had. Many of us have had to deal with housing development in our own localities. Housing has slipped down the public agenda, despite fulfilling a basic human need, and is frequently perceived as a purely local and technical matter. Because of that, housing development figures are seen to be irrefutable and handed down from above, although they should be a key element in debate with the public. We all know that housing is one of the issues that should gain resonance during general elections, but recently it has failed to feature. The Department of the Environment published the latest set of household projections in 1995. The figures predicted a 4.4 million, or 23 per cent., increase in the number of households in England between 1991 and 2016, and have been used to determine the level and location of new housing development across the country. What is emerging is the existence of localised planning disputes focusing on the specifics of individual sites and the question of where the housing should go. What is being missed is the bigger picture, and questions about whether the housing figures are valid or indeed desirable, whether their impact is acceptable in economic, social and environmental terms and whether they amount to a coherent strategy. In my constituency, there is growing resentment about plans for thousands of extra houses, which has resulted in many letters in my postbag. For much of my time as a local councillor, I have been personally involved with development and planning, and I understand the frustration felt by many local residents. I believe that the time has come when we must be prepared to question the basis of the housing projections, particularly if we want to be a listening Government. I want to raise three specific concerns: the validity and repercussions of the housing figures, the issue of sustainability and the role of public policy in housing. The current projection of 4.4 million additional households is based on the assumption that the future is simply a continuation of past trends, and, in particular, that demographic changes, migration patterns and social behaviour will continue much as before. That is admitted in the last Government's paper on household growth, although in other areas of policy such as road building the "" predict and provide"" approach is now being seriously questioned, primarily on grounds of environmental impact. Research by Professor Glen Bramley of Heriot-Watt university has highlighted the circularity of the relationship between household projections and economic and housing market factors-the influence of the supply of housing on demand, and vice versa. That has much in common with the road-building and traffic debate. Let me now deal with some of the specific factors that generate housing numbers: an aging population, the fact that younger people are leaving home earlier, the growing divorce and separation rate, the existence of more single-person households and migration flows across the country, essentially from urban to rural areas and from north to south. I am particularly interested in that last feature, because of the dynamic that migration causes in parts of the country. In the south-west, it generates development as much as indigenous growth. We must therefore subject the figures to thorough scrutiny. Research carried out over the past two years by John Allinson of the University of the West of England on net migration into Gloucestershire raises serious doubts about the robustness of the net in-migration figures being used to determine the massive house-building programme, and an approach based entirely on past trends rather than public policy. In its structure plan, Gloucestershire county council assumes a net annual in-migration of 2,700 people, but Allinson demonstrates that the true figure is much lower. In his view, that is due to emerging societal sea changes relating principally to labour and housing markets. The real significance of John Allinson's research, however, lies in what he has to say about migration patterns beyond Gloucestershire at regional and national levels. The overall implications are simple but dramatic. In Gloucestershire, planners are about to make provision for some 6,000 more houses than are required, thereby needlessly and irreversibly destroying hundreds of acres of green-field land. The reduction in net migration flows that is increasingly evident in Gloucestershire is being replicated in the other counties in the south-west and in other regions, and is part of a wider national trend. Moreover, public policy can have an impact on migration between areas of the country, and, in particular, out of our cities. Although the research only examines the migration element of the household projections, that element accounts for more than half the predicted growth in Gloucestershire, and is therefore significant. However, there are other aspects of the key assumption that raise doubts about the overall soundness of the projections and the methodology employed. For example, the figures assume virtually no increase in the proportion of households in which people are cohabiting, which rose from 2.9 per cent. to 6.4 per cent. between 1981 and 1991. It is projected to have risen by only 0.3 per cent. between 1991 and 2016, which reinforces the thesis of a massive growth in single-person households. The figures do not appear to have been adjusted for the estimated missing million people who failed to complete the 1991 census, thereby reducing the average household size and, again, reinforcing the thesis of a smaller household-a case of "" Honey, I shrunk the household"". That provides strong evidence that the household figures are open to challenge, are likely to be a significant overestimate and therefore need to be reviewed as part of a reappraisal of housing requirements. Given the consequences for local economies, communities and the environment, the accumulated data must be acted on. The numbers will be affected, directly and indirectly, by policy decisions. For example, a substantial regional investment creating jobs eventually affects migration from, for instance, the north to the south. Social, affordable housing provision designed to meet the local needs of those on low incomes-the homeless and young indigenous people-is more effective than massive increases in housing supply at lower prices. Similarly, changing patterns of student study may encourage students to stay in their home environment, and improvements in standards in urban schools may persuade families to stay in the cities. We therefore have serious doubts about trend-based forecasts that take the last 20 years, and roll the findings forward into the next 20 and make the result the main presumption behind housing needs. Next, let me deal with sustainability. Notwithstanding the arguments, we must consider how the housing debate can be advanced. The concept of sustainability needs to be central. More clarity and a higher priority are required before its implications for economies, communities and the environment can be properly weighed within a modernised planning system. Associated issues of capacity and environmental impact assessment are also essential if we are to have more integrated evolutionary planning. One way in which we could reduce development pressures without absolving ourselves of responsibility for unforeseen changes, while maintaining a coherent planning strategy, would be to introduce the phasing of land allocation for development. Programmed reviews of need would be built in, and, perhaps, land would be released on a sequential basis designed to enhance sustainability and the regeneration of local economies and communities, and to discourage cherry-picking of the best green-field sites. Another associated issue is the use of brown-field sites in preference to green-field sites. In principle, that approach supports the notion that minimising the impact on the environment should largely determine the location of new housing. The last Government suggested in a White Paper a target of 50 per cent. building on brown-field sites, and more recently the United Kingdom round table on sustainable development has suggested a 75 per cent. target. The identification of brown-field sites has posed difficulties, and local authorities need to make a greater effort. A system of incentives and constraints is required if less attractive or costly sites are to be provided. Nevertheless, those high targets are likely to prove unrealistic. Brown-field sites are not evenly distributed across the country, and the impact on the urban environment needs to be considered carefully.",25222,[],Housing,0,1,housing,1474
1997-11-12,Housing,38,Andrew Robathan,Con,False,"I have been listening with much interest to the hon. Gentleman's speech. Does he agree that, to an extent, the use of brown-field sites is a question of urban renewal? If we built sensible housing-dare I say, what abroad would be termed apartments, and what people wish to live in in Paris-instead of building detached housing in the countryside, in which people are encouraged to live, we would kill two birds with one stone. We would renew the cities without destroying the countryside of which the hon. Gentleman has spoken so eloquently.",25222,[],Housing,0,2,housing,92
1997-11-12,Housing,39,David Drew,Lab,False,"I agree with the hon. Member. Planning policies should reflect that, so that we prevent an attack on our countryside and make urban centres places where people want to live. To degrade the quality of life in cities through excessive development will, ultimately, prove to be disastrous for the countryside, as it will inevitably lead to further migration. If we are to wean people off the car, we must think hard about where development is placed, and how sufficient jobs can be created locally. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that that has been successful. Too often, the locus for new development is road systems, and jobs have to follow people. That results in settlements that are essentially commuter land. Sadly, where such developments have occurred, rather than adding to the social mix, younger people are driven out and jobs go with them. Those features are only too apparent in my constituency. Stroud is currently having to implement a new county structure plan as well as attempting its own local plan. The area faces considerable constraints, because 50 per cent. of the district is designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty, another 27 per cent. runs along the Severn estuary, much of which is a site of international ecological importance, and a significant remainder of the district is prime agricultural land or has conservation area status. Less than 5 per cent. of the land is considered brown-field, much of which is already designated for employment purposes. Outside those constraints, there are areas of immense sensitivity. The late Laurie Lee's Slad valley has no protective designation, and was subject to a recent planning inquiry, which was thankfully turned down. Does anyone pretend that that is acceptable? Despite those constraints, this summer Stroud district council produced a draft plan for consultation. It has encouraged the involvement in that process of parish and town councils and the general public. In a survey of the entire district, 70 per cent. of those who responded supported a dispersal strategy as opposed to a new settlement, which was the favoured option of the county council initially and which would have had a devastating impact on the environment and on the economies of local market towns, especially Stroud. Stroud district council is now attempting a bottom-up approach to resolve difficulties. It is too early to say whether that bold approach will be successful, but it must be the way forward, provided that the numbers are realistic and account is taken of the constraints. There is a need to understand the specific dynamics of our rural areas, but that is not to argue that, as an alternative, houses should be crammed into cities. The message is that the future health and sustainability of the countryside is dependent on the health and sustainability of our cities. We must revise the approach that resulted in urban and rural policies being entirely separate spheres, and we should examine the relationship between the two as a basis of a clearer vision of what both want. Protection of the countryside must go hand in hand with a strong, urban policy. I want to comment on the planning system. I would argue for a proper, plan-led system to enable communities better to control their environment and to meet local needs, and to bring certainty into the process. That would overcome the policy and practice in recent years that allowed market forces to dominate. One of my concerns is provision for windfall sites, which undermines the certainty of a plan-led system. The Council for the Protection of Rural England argues that windfalls should be adequately accounted for by local authorities. In particular, a plan-led system would provide for a specific number of homes to be built, which would reassure village communities that a precedent is not being created for excessive development in the future. A plan-led system should also allow proper provision for social housing to deal with homelessness and social exclusion, rather than having to rely on piggy-backing private development. I support the Government's regional strategy. I advocate combining the capacity that it offers with the development of a broad planning policy with a bottom-up approach that involves people in the creation of sustainable, revitalised communities. I would welcome a visit to Gloucestershire by the Minister, not to get him embroiled in protracted local issues, but to engage him in a wide discussion on the Government's thinking on how the planning system could be improved. The Government have been criticised by the Conservative party for not listening to the interests of the countryside. I hope that, by initiating this debate, I have shown that Labour Members are genuinely concerned with the real issues of the countryside, and that we will play our part in this major issue. We have shown our concern through local Agenda 21-or Vision 21 as we call it in Gloucestershire-whereby factors such as sustainability have been discussed. In its own way, that could be a model for the future. It is through such initiatives and getting people involved that we shall begin to find answers to what otherwise seems to be an intractable problem.",25222,[],Housing,0,3,housing,854

1997-11-12,Housing,41,Nigel Evans,Con,False,"I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate. I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). He even acknowledged that Conservative Members are suspicious that Labour Members have no care for the countryside. I was grateful for his contribution, and I shall listen carefully to ensure that the Minister agrees with him, and with the vast majority of Conservative Members, that we must do much more to preserve the countryside that we all enjoy, irrespective of whether we live in the country or the town. I am not speaking from a NIMBYist "" not in my backyard"" position. I shall talk about the importance of preserving the countryside in my area, but I shall also refer to the commitment of certain villages in my constituency to the need to give some of their land for extra housing. The previous Government's commitment to the preservation of the environment was second to none. We shall be careful to ensure that that commitment is carried on by the new Government. The previous Secretary of State for the Environment, my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), said in a debate only last week that he could recall only one occasion on which he gave permission to build on a green-field site. The new Government have a lot to live up to. When she was Prime Minister, Baroness Thatcher said that we were merely leaseholders of this land for future generations. It is a full, repairing lease, so we have a lot of work to do. Conservative Members are suspicious not only of the private Member's Bill promoted by the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), but of the Government's commitment to agriculture, especially in less-favoured areas. Agriculture is part of the countryside that we all enjoy. The Â£60 million in hill livestock compensatory allowances for last year will be taken away for this year, and that will be a terrible deprivation for farmers. That is one of the reasons why Conservative Members are so concerned. There is much concern about the problems that new homes in the countryside bring with them. We have to put up with extra traffic from tourists and those who come to live in the countryside, and extra pressure is caused by the erection of telecommunication masts, wind turbines and pylons. The countryside is under attack not just from housing, but from other pressures. Several reports over the summer-primarily in The Sunday Times-claimed that the Government are preparing to relax restrictions on the building of up to 2 million new homes in the countryside. The reports claimed that millions of acres of green-field land, such as the green-belt land between Hemel Hempstead and Stevenage, could be converted into housing estates. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the report of the Round Table on Sustainable Development, which said that 75 per cent. of extra housing could be built on brown-field sites. If the Government are sufficiently committed to that, it will be done. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) said that we should consider different ways of providing the extra housing that will be necessary due to changing demographics and people's changing needs. It has been estimated that, without any restrictions, the countryside will have to find room for at least 2 million more homes. Current figures from the Council for the Protection of Rural England show that, 270,000 acres of countryside will each year be flooded with concrete by developers. That is equivalent to 250,000 football pitches. The CPRE reckons that, by 2016, an area the size of Hampshire will have been lost-and that is before the relaxation of current restrictions. Imagine how much worse it would be if the Government allowed building on green-field sites. I do not dispute that extra housing is needed, but we have to be careful exactly where we put it all. How turning much of our green and pleasant land into an urban jungle will solve the problems of neglected inner cities is beyond me. I have already seen what plans to build on small villages can do to an area. The hon. Member for Stroud talked about his constituency; 75 per cent. of my constituency is an area of outstanding natural beauty. That means that, in many ways, there is much more pressure on the rest of the constituency. People think that there is a straight demarcation line: they are either in the AONB or outside it. Of course, much of the area leads up to the AONB, so it is all part of the countryside that people enjoy.",25222,[],Housing,0,5,housing,767
1997-11-12,Housing,42,David Lidington,Con,False,"I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. Does he accept that in constituencies such as his, or mine on the fringe of the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty and green belt, there is reinforced pressure for development because they lie just beyond the fringe of areas where restraint is obligatory?",25222,[],Housing,0,6,housing,55
1997-11-12,Housing,43,Nigel Evans,Con,False,"Of course I accept that. Because they enjoy the countryside in the area of outstanding natural beauty, people live as close as they can to it; it is on their doorstep. They do not realise that, as all this building is going on there, they are helping to scar and to encroach on AONBs and to damage the very thing that they love, so we have to be guarded about that. On villages with surrounding AONBs, as I have said, in my constituency Barrow has taken on more than 200 houses. That does not sound like a lot, but it is double the size of the village. Clitheroe, another area around my constituency, is one of the larger market towns and it has taken on several hundred houses, which are dotted all over the place. Each application does not sound like an awful lot-some are for only about 70 or 100 houses-but they all take up different green-field sites dotted around the town. One green-field site is taken up after another, although each application is for only one more green-field site. Over years, several green-field sites have been taken over. They are disappearing by stealth, and we must guard against such applications. In Ribchester, a brown-field site has been used for extra housing: it is a mixed development of affordable housing and less affordable housing. I have no problems with that at all, although there was much concern among villagers about all the extra housing coming in. However, the new development has married well with the village. Longridge has also given over some extra fields to housing. As the name would suggest, Fulwood-which is near the Preston end of the constituency, which is more urban-was at some stage a wood. Now we can drop the word "" wood"" and just have the word "" full"", because just four green-field sites are left. The Commission for the New Towns owns those four fields. I and residents in the area have had many meetings with the CNT, trying to appeal to it. We know that it has an obligation to get the best price for the land, and one of the ways in which to do that is obviously to secure planning permission for houses on it, but we have asked the CNT to be a little compassionate and to have regard to all the extra housing that has been built in the Fulwood area-some "" lungs"" are necessary for all the people who have moved into the extra housing. We have had some constructive meetings with the CNT, and I hope that they will continue. My constituency has also suffered from the fact that three large institutions have virtually all closed, apart from one that is now half in operation. They are former mental institutions of the Victorian style, which housed 3,000 patients. As they have closed, they have become ripe for sell-off and for housing then to be built there. Because those large institutions were not too far away from other villages, which used to supply much of the work force, there is now tremendous pressure for the old hospitals to be flattened and for developments of 1,000 houses to be put on those areas, with little regard to the fact that there are only 500 houses in the neighbouring village. Again, we ask the Minister to consider those sites carefully. No one is discounting the fact that, once the hospitals disappear, building can go on to the footprint of the old hospital site, but people resent green fields around the old hospital being given up so that extra housing can go on to those green-field sites as well, totally swamping the old villages, with little regard for the infrastructure, never mind the fact that doctors' surgeries and schools cannot cope with the extra numbers. One of the deals is to say to developers, "" You can put on these extra houses so long as you give us extra money to build an extra school."" It is called planning gain. I plead with the Minister: there is such a thing as non-planning gain. One of the reasons why people go to live in or visit the countryside is because conditions in cities and towns are not replicated there. Certain people, as we have already heard, want to live in cities and towns, and we have to regenerate those areas to ensure that they can do so. It is done in other countries and we should be looking to do it more here. That will also work as a safety valve for less building in the countryside, so that people can come from cities and towns and enjoy the countryside as well. I ask the Minister, therefore, to consider carefully those old hospital sites. Many other institutions are past their sell-by date and there is now tremendous pressure for them to be turned into something else. Another one, called Whittingham, an old mental institution, has been flattened and there is tremendous pressure to put 1,000 houses on that site as well. There are about 500 houses in the local village, and villagers are protesting. We have the support of the local council to ensure that the development is down to about 375 houses, so it is not true that we do not want any houses there. We accept that some building will take place, but we ask for sensitivity to ensure that the developments are as small as possible. I shall now bring my remarks to a close because I know that many other hon. Members want to speak about the problems in their constituencies, and the more people talk about their anecdotal evidence, the stronger the case will be. In many cases, building on green fields is viewed as cheaper, but it will have an enormous cost, which will be borne by all of us and by future generations, if we allow it to go ahead. Those future generations have no say at the moment and we have to speak up on their behalf as well, so that they can enjoy what we are enjoying currently.",25222,[],Housing,0,7,housing,1016
1997-11-12,Housing,44,Tess Kingham,Lab,False,"I support much of what my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) has said. However, representing an urban constituency, I view the issue of the 40,000 to 50,000-plus new homes to be developed in our county from a slightly different perspective. Perhaps I feel a little sensitive that my constituency, the city of Gloucester, might be an easy target for the new developments and the tens of thousands of new homes that we have to accommodate on our doorstep, because the recent history of growth has been one of incremental development on the boundary of Gloucester. Often, housing estates have sprung up on the edges of the city, where the agenda has been set predominantly by developers rather than by the communities that have to sustain themselves for future generations. I have another anecdotal, but perhaps briefer, example. Quedgeley in my constituency has about 10,000 residents. It is a big new development on the southern part of Gloucester city. It was originally developed as part of Stroud district, but the residents, being so close to Gloucester, needed to rely to on Gloucester for services, for transport and for everything that is required to sustain a community. Eventually, therefore, the city boundaries were changed and Quedgeley became a welcome part of our city. However, the people there now feel let down because, over time, they have realised that they have nice houses, but little else. They have a poor transport network after bus deregulation, few community services, few pre-school services and poor shopping facilities. Abbeymead is another big estate that has been bolted on to the east of the city. It comprises very nice houses-predominantly three to four-bedroom or smaller detached houses that attract young families. Yet, once again, it is a developer-led settlement rather than a community-led settlement, so residents have little access to good public transport. There is no pre-school provision for under-fives, and shopping facilities are bad. The developments that have sprung up around Gloucester have been bolted on to the edge of our city and are developer-led. We should be building communities, not simply houses. Gloucester has learnt some sharp lessons from the new developments. The Government should provide a lead, centrally and at county level, and address the housing puzzle with more vision. The previous Government left us in a mess. We are now looking to the new Labour Government not simply to puzzle out where to put new houses, but to have a long-term strategic vision of where future communities should be. It is often convenient for rural areas to avoid any development by shunting developments on to the urban fringes, but that is storing up problems for the future. I understand that those living in beautiful rural areas do not want large developments, but nor do we want to take what often seems to be the easy option-shoving new developments on to the edges of cities without any real consideration for the needs of the communities. More than half Gloucestershire comprises areas of outstanding natural beauty or green belt land. It would be very difficult for Gloucester to absorb many more new developments by bolting them on to the edges of our cities without longer-term vision and a strategic approach to developing communities. There are difficulties, because we have to rely on private developers. We know what we want in our cities-it has already been mentioned by Opposition Members. We want to develop inner-city areas-flats above shops, small low-cost housing units for single people and elderly people. We want some of the run-down areas in the city to be redeveloped. However, we have to rely on private developers. When they can choose between regenerating an inner-city area with derelict streets or building profitable estates bolted on to the outskirts of cities, we all know which option they will take. We want development in Gloucester to be from the inside out, not bolted on the outskirts of the city. We are looking to the new Labour Government to take a firm lead, as I am sure they will, in clearing up the mess that we were left by the previous Administration. We want an approach that goes beyond physical planning, reliance on private developers and current planning arrangements. We need a joint strategy to encompass housing, employment needs and transport to create large self-sustaining communities and a regional policy that meets that vision. I want to be able to reassure local communities in Gloucester that it is not simply a puzzle of where to put 40,000 to 50,000 new house and shunting them between rural and urban areas. Therefore, I am asking the Government to reassure the people in my constituency that there is a long-term vision of building communities that takes us into the new millennium considering all the elements that a new community needs, including employment, community facilities and giving local authorities the power and encouragement to deal with private developers and look at the real needs of the communities that they serve.",25222,[],Housing,0,8,housing,832
1997-11-12,Housing,45,Tom Brake,LibDem,False,"I thank the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) for initiating today's debate on an issue that affects rural constituencies and suburban ones such as mine. The hon. Member for Stroud has already explained why there will be an increase in the number of households. That there will be is indisputable, but there is doubt about the number of homes that might be required. A figure of 4.4 million has been mentioned, but it is possible to reach another figure-some 500,000-and I shall explain how. The 4.4 million figure was projected in 1991. Since then, up to 1 million homes may already have been built, so we may be talking about a requirement of an additional 3.4 million. The figures assume inward migration. Historically, there have been periods when there has been no inward migration, so it is possible that 500,000 fewer dwellings may be needed. Assumptions have been made about the increase in the number of single households. If half the built-in increase actually occurs, a further 600,000 homes may be knocked off the estimate. Finally, there are 800,000 empty homes, so that figure can be taken off the list. If we subtract all those figures from the original 4.4 million, we are left with 500,000. My calculation illustrates the wide range of figures that could be used, and the discrepancy makes it extremely important that the Government re-examine the figures. The figures were produced in 1991 and the Government should not assume, six years later, that 4.4 million homes continue to be required and that new settlements and towns should be built throughout the country on the basis of figures that could be significantly out.",25222,[],Housing,0,9,housing,277

1997-11-12,Housing,50,Tom Brake,LibDem,False,"The Government should re-examine the projections, otherwise builders will embark unnecessarily on a massive building programme. I should like to know whether demand can be reduced. The previous Government attempted to use social engineering with back to basics, but I am not suggesting that route. Demand cannot be reduced by social engineering, but something can be done about the 800,000 empty homes. The Government should support initiatives such as the above-shop scheme. In the past couple of days, my local council has set up an empty homes hotline that people can call if they have inherited a home that they are not using or are aware of a dwelling that has been empty for a number of years. Such schemes should be encouraged. Can housing demand be influenced by the Government? Undoubtedly-even if they influence only inter-region migration. As the hon. Member for Stroud mentioned, the Government could increase employment and prosperity in certain areas, thereby reducing the need for migration. An integrated transport policy could help to ensure that currently inaccessible places are easier to reach, and make people want to remain there. The Government should examine also the reasons for inter-region migration. If we accept that millions of homes are required, should we build them? We are back to the predict-and-provide question. Unlike roads-to which one can provide an alternative in the form of public transport-we cannot provide an alternative to a roof over someone's head; housing has to be provided. If we provide housing, where should it be built? Brown-field and green-field sites have already been mentioned. The Government currently believe that perhaps 50 per cent. of new housing can be built on brown-field sites and that the remaining 50 per cent. can be built in other locations. Other experts hold a different view-that possibly 60 per cent. of new housing can be built on brown-field sites and that 40 per cent. can be built in other areas. There is a good case for choosing and running with a target. Perhaps the Government should consider a 60 per cent. rather than a 50 per cent. construction target on brown-field sites. Whether homes are built on brown-field or green-field sites, there will be some common requirements, some of which the hon. Member for Gloucester (Ms Kingham) outlined. Matters that require consideration include transport, health provision, education, social services, water resources and a host of other issues that will have to be considered at the time. In my constituency, in the ward of Wandle valley, there has been massive private residential development. The only problem is that general practitioner services have not kept pace and many people now find it extremely difficult to get on to a GP's list. We must consider all the implications before we start a building programme on either brown-field or green-field sites. It is environmentally preferable to build on brown-field sites. As technological advances are made, it will be easier, and I hope cheaper, to decontaminate sites. In my constituency, a BP chemical plant is being redeveloped as a model housing estate, with which we are very pleased. Moreover, commercial advances will make decontamination easier. Recently, an organisation with which some hon. Members may be familiar launched a commercial insurance scheme under which it provides land certification and developers with cover for potential risks associated with decontamination work. Such developments will make it easier to develop brown-field sites, but we must ensure that jobs follow those developments. There is no point building homes on brown-field-or even on green-field-sites if there are no jobs. Furthermore, development will have to go hand in hand with regeneration of town centres. As hon. Members have said in this debate, brown-field site developments can help us to regenerate inner cities and other urban areas. There is undoubtedly insufficient brown-field land. We must therefore consider building on other land-on what I have described as taupe-field land. For hon. Members who do not know it, taupe is a mixture of brown and grey. Taupe-field sites are those on which there is already some development, such as a road or a retail or industrial park. If we run out of brown-field land, perhaps we should consider either taupe-field sites or land on which there has been limited development, such as Ministry of Defence land.",25222,[],Housing,0,14,housing,712

Organisations that one would never have expected to support such development are already saying, "" Yes, it will have to happen, because a limited amount of land is available for development."" I should like Ministers, first, to review the housing projections. They must be reviewed, regardless of whether they are made on a three-yearly basis. Secondly, the Government should also back an empty homes campaign, spearheaded by all local authorities.

1997-11-12,Housing,53,Michael Wills,Lab,False,"Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to speak in a debate on a matter that is of such great concern to my constituents in North Swindon. I know that our concerns are shared by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Ms Drown). I too should like to add my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) on initiating this important debate. As he rightly said, the housing need projection could change the face of the country and transform the way in which we live. I therefore agree with him and with other hon. Members who have spoken that that figure requires greater scrutiny. Some housing increase is clearly required. The Government must also tackle the legacy of homelessness that they have inherited from the previous Government-an objective on which they have made a heartening start. Equally, new housing may have to be provided because of changing living patterns. The sheer scale of the numbers, however, is causing concern. It is projected that, by 2016, more than 5,000 new homes will be required in every constituency in the country, with all the consequent pressures on the local environment and infrastructure. In Swindon, pressure on our green-field sites is already intense, and our share of the projected numbers could turn an already intolerable situation into an impossible one. I am sure that we are not alone, because numbers on such a scale amount to a revolution. I hope that no hon. Member would embark on a revolution without the most rigorous analysis of all the issues. Much of the national debate-although not in the Chamber today, I am pleased to note-has focused on where new housing should be built and on the correct balance between green-field and brown-field sites. Although that is a vital issue, I should like to focus today on what, logically, is a prior issue. How certain can we be that we really need to make provision for quite so many homes? The answer must be: not very. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud and other hon. Members have said, the numbers have been reached by trend-based projections, which are extrapolations based on past behaviour. The evidence is that that technique has not proved wholly reliable. Between 1981 and 1992, for example, projections for annual household formation between 1991 and 1996 varied by almost 100 per cent. Will such reliability really provide the basis for paving over our fields? I hope not. I suggest that public policy should never be too narrowly based on projections derived from highly complex sets of assumptions about human behaviour in 20 years' time. Will such projections really provide the only justification for concreting over our green spaces? Again, I hope not. I fear, however, that that is precisely what we will do if we allow the figure of 4.4 million new homes required by 2016 to be the driver of our housing policy. As my hon. Friends and Opposition Members have pointed out, the figure is based on assumptions about social trends, which could easily turn out to be wrong in a society that is increasingly characterised by rapid change. Even relatively limited areas in the assumptions could have significant consequences for the figures. In a study published in August, the city firm Credit Lyonnais Laing estimates that more than 1 million homes could be removed from the projection total if different, but realistic, assumptions are made about the growth in single unmarried households and a return to nil migration. All the experience of government in recent years tells us that, the more complex the calculations, the more likely they are to be wrong. These calculations are very complex. The more the Government depend on such calculations, the more likely they are to make mistakes. Of course a start must be made somewhere. It would be wrong of me to cast aspersions on the validity of the methodology; that is not the point. The point is that government is an iterative process. It has to respond to the way in which complex forces interact with each other. We must not let a mathematical formula alone transform our landscape and our environment.",25222,[],Housing,0,17,housing,698

It is clear from all the speeches in this debate that policies to implement the current figures will have a dramatic impact on this country. Surely there should be a more fully informed public debate on whether the people want their lives to be transformed in such a way. Why cannot the Government produce a spread of scenarios based on realistic variations of key statistical factors, showing the impact of each scenario on the projected housing need and the resulting implications for the environment? With such a range of scenarios, we would be in a position to start making democratic decisions about whether we want to try to influence the key factors driving housing demand to produce a different outcome from the one we currently foresee.

Should not we also be prepared to consider such action for environmental ones too? The election of the Government on 1 May revealed that people wanted to take their future back into their own hands. Now is the time for the Government to help them to do so over one of the most important issues facing the country.

1997-11-12,Housing,58,James Clappison,Con,False,"I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate. I congratulate the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) on securing a debate on this very important subject. He made a detailed speech about the statistics and analysis underlying the housing requirement. I do not propose to go too far down that route. The hon. Member for Stroud will know that the previous Government received expert advice that there would be a growth in the number of households from 19.2 million to 23.6 million between 1991 and 2016. The hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) and for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) cast some doubts on the statistics. It will be important for the Minister in his winding-up speech to say whether he agrees with the projection. The figure is, of course, only a projection, which can always be revised. If it is revised downwards, we would all be pleased. None the less, the projection was made on the basis of expert advice, so it is incumbent on the Minister to say clearly whether he accepts it or questions it in the way his Back Benchers have. The previous Government received the expert advice from very good sources. I say to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington that that advice was considered by the then Select Committee on the Environment, which did not question the projection. In fact, it said that there was a consensus among experts that the figure might be an underestimate. When the Government receive such expert advice, they have to be responsible, act on it, and be open. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) for his openness. He acted on the best advice available. For him, the question was not so much how many, but where. He set about planning in the most sustainable and environmentally friendly way. As the last Secretary of State for the Environment, he was a great friend of the environment. My speech will concentrate on the environment. In meeting the housing requirement, it is vital that the planning system responds to the challenge and, if at all possible, steers development away from the green belt. I am very troubled, as a Member representing Hertfordshire, by the way in which the county and some borough authorities have responded to the planning process. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) said, Hertfordshire county council has allocated for development 1,000 acres of green belt between Hemel Hempstead and Stevenage.

1997-11-12,Housing,60,James Clappison,Con,False,"As the House has already heard, the previous Government signalled to developers that they should try to avoid green belt sites. The House has also heard how very difficult it was to get permission for green belt sites from the previous Government. Indeed, the Opposition are a little troubled that the present Government have already given permission for a significant green belt development in Birmingham. I return to the issue of Hertfordshire, which is important to me as a Member representing the county. I am concerned about not only the county development but the borough development in my constituency. My local authority first responded to its requirement of 4,600 new homes by issuing a draft local plan that identified three green belt sites. One was a particularly sensitive part of my constituency in Borehamwood-land known as Woodcock Hill north of Barnet lane in Borehamwood- where there are very strong green belt reasons for not allowing development to take place. There was a significant campaign against development on the site in my constituency. I pay tribute to the Elstree and Borehamwood Green Belt Society and the Woodcock Hill Open Spaces Forever-WHOSE-campaign. They have persuaded the local authority to think again and, in the latest version of the draft local plan, part of the site has been removed-although I regret that part of it is still to be built on. Unhappily, my local authority is now planning to build on another six green belt sites-building into the open countryside in some cases-against strong green belt considerations, in places such as Cherry Tree lane in Potters Bar and Watford road in Radlett, affecting the village character of Radlett and the green open spaces around Potters Bar. We value our green open spaces in Hertsmere. As hon. Members who have travelled through the area know, it contains the first green spaces on routes out of London. The issues that I have raised are the responsibility of the local planning authority. Like many others, I have made my representations to it. I want the Government to give a strong signal to the planners, who are deciding how the housing requirement will be met. It is incumbent on the Government to send a clear signal that the green belt needs very strong protection. I should like a strong restatement from the Minister of the importance of the green belt. One or two recent Government statements, made under the pressure of debate or radio interviews, have not put as strong an emphasis on green belt protection as they might have done. We know that appearing on the "" Today"" programme can put one under pressure. However, the Minister said in an interview on that programme that the green belt was "" up for grabs in the sense that it is always up for grabs. There are planning guidances to say that you can build on green belt in certain circumstances."" The Minister was a little modest in stating the protection that Government policy affords the green belt. Under the previous Government, green belt policy was embodied in planning policy guidance 2, which says not simply that the green belt can be built on in certain circumstances, but: "" There is a presumption against inappropriate development in the green belt unless very special circumstances exist which outweigh the harm caused by the development. Proposals in draft plans that would result in releasing land from the green belt must be fully justified. The Government are committed to protecting the green belt and encourage the recycling of land in urban areas wherever possible to meet development needs."" We need a robust re-statement from the Minister of the importance of the green belt. We also need a commitment from the Government to consider the targets for brown-field development. We have heard about the targets set by the previous Government. In 1995 we set a target of half of all new development taking place on brown-field land. We thought that that needed to be looked at again and revised upwards. We were considering moving up to 60 per cent. The Minister knows that we received good advice from the Council for the Protection of Rural England and from the Round Table on Sustainable Development that as much as 75 per cent. could be achieved. I ask the new Government to consider that expert advice carefully, particularly that from the round table, which was promoted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal under the previous Government as a source of good, independent, impartial advice to the Government. If any Government ever needed such impartial advice rather than cheerleading, the present Government do. They should consider that advice, even if it is sometimes uncomfortable, as it was for the previous Government. I ask the Minister to look carefully at the targets. I know that it may be a little early for a definite reply, but he should give us some indication that he is giving the ideas a fair wind.

They are both issuing a serious challenge to their Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) asked whether the Government accepted the projected figures.

We are told that the Government are considering the 700 responses to the Green Paper, "" Where shall we live?"", Perhaps it would have been better titled, "" Where will you live?"", because most of us know where we wish to live, and we choose to live where we want to live. Some of the comments from Labour Members have shown that there is a danger of telling people what to do. I have chosen to live in the countryside, in a semi-rural area. I do not wish to deprive other people of the chance to do that, but I recognise that we should be concerned about the destruction of the existing environment. One of the concerns in East Dorset at the moment is that the Government's response to the East Dorset draft plan said that the proposed densities were not high enough. Coupled with the rather vague definition of brown land, that means that people who live in houses with gardens are threatened by substantial infill development that would dramatically alter the character of those areas and would, ironically, increase the pressure for more people to live in the countryside. I hope that the Minister will tell us when the Government will produce some conclusions and stop the general chit-chat on the issue. The time for action is now.",25222,[],Housing,0,28,housing,259

1997-11-12,Housing,67,Richard Caborn,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend's comments have been noted by the House and will appear in Hansard. I first wish to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) on initiating the debate today. As has been mentioned, it was covered in part in the Opposition day debate on rural life. The housing problem is a major issue facing society today. I would love to come to the Dispatch Box and say that no new houses need to be built, but that is not the reality. It is not the Government who are changing social patterns-that is happening out there in the real world. The Government have to accept that and respond to it. Many opportunities will arise from the growth in the number of households, and some have been mentioned this morning. Mixed development is an exciting prospect, and I have visited imaginative mixed development schemes in Liverpool and Manchester. The Government will encourage those. I hope that the White Paper will be supportive of regional development agencies and will address the need to improve economic growth and tackle underperformance in the English regions. I hope that it will also suggest ways to relieve those areas in which economic development is overheating and to bring areas that are under-utilised closer to the average. I hope that the Government will be positive and constructive in the White Paper and the Bill that will be introduced later in the year. I also hope that hon. Members will contribute to the White Paper on an integrated transport system, which will be important for the environment and for the issues that we are discussing today. While we accept that the market has a role to play in housing, we believe that the Government also have a role to play. Unfortunately, the previous Administration abdicated many of their responsibilities. The main concerns for my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud are whether we believe the household projections and, more particularly, whether we need to plan for the number of households that they suggest will be formed. He has also, rightly, raised the special concerns of his constituency, where the projections require decisions to identify how and where housing should be provided, not just how much. I will try to address each of those issues in turn. It will be useful for the House-because there seems to be some misunderstanding-if I explain what the household projections are, how they are arrived at, what they say, and how they are translated into development plans. In many areas of government, we do not have the luxury of looking a long way into the future and trying to plan for the changes that we expect will happen. The household projections do just that. They enable local authorities to estimate in their development plans the additional housing that they should provide in the next 10 years or so. The first stage in the process involves assessing the population of the country using the census and the regular sub-national population projections, which are updated every two to three years. Migration trends, which have been mentioned by several hon. Members, are taken into account in that assessment, and local authorities are consulted about the accuracy of the trends. The evaluation is a rolling programme that is updated every three to four years. The result is a demographic picture of the country for up to 25 years into the future. The second stage involves turning the population projections into household projections. That is done by dividing the population into five types of household, and projecting the trends in their formation rates into the future. Figures are available for every county and metropolitan area in the country.",25222,[],Housing,0,31,housing,614

1997-11-12,Housing,73,Richard Caborn,Lab,False,"My comments about consultation were in a wider context. The plan-led system exists, and planning guidance will continue to be subjected to consultation among those whom it will affect. The regional planning conferences decide how much new growth their urban areas can take and broadly how much should go on brown-field sites and how much on green-field sites. If the Secretary of State is happy with their decisions, the advice is formally turned into regional planning guidance by the Government office. Following that, counties and local authorities use the regional planning guidance as the basis for preparing their plans. At each stage, the projections are again tested and distributed by the authorities. So where all the housing goes eventually-green-field or brown-field sites-is decided by the local authorities. It must be stressed that that is where the decision is taken. It is unfortunate that the debate still seems to be stuck on the question whether we believe the projections, or whether we need to meet demand. That ground has been examined in detail on numerous occasions, especially in the previous Administration's Green Paper "" Household Growth-Where shall we live?"", which has been mentioned already today. That document stated in no uncertain terms that large-scale household growth was a fact driven by social, demographic, and cultural changes and that we should address how we can manage the problems, or grasp the opportunities that the growth presents, rather than focusing on "" not in my back yard"" attitudes.",25222,[],Housing,0,37,housing,245

I was about to say that, since the 1920s, every projection for household growth has been an underestimate. Moreover, in 1995 the Environment Committee's inquiry into housing need went through the entire methodology of the way in which such figures are arrived at. It is not for me, from the Dispatch Box, to direct, but all I can suggest is that, if Select Committees wishes to revisit that methodology and the rest of what the Select Committee did in 1995, it is open to it to do so.",25222,[],Housing,0,39,housing,115
1997-11-12,Housing,76,Richard Caborn,Lab,False,"I cannot give way again. Time is moving on. Many people still criticise the system, but no one produces viable alternatives. With all due respect, it was a bit of a back-of-the-fag packet calculation by which the figure was brought down this morning from 4.4 million to half a million. Those who suggest that local authorities should not make adequate provision for projected housing demand often seem to ignore the consequences. People must realise that serious under-provision would mean house price inflation, as demand bids up prices-and the average price of residential development land in England is already Â£250,000 per acre. That would mean an increase in the Government's social housing bill, because more people would be unable to afford their own homes, and because land prices would continue to rise. It would even mean an increase in homelessness as some people were forced out of the system altogether, and, with fewer homes to go round, an increase in sharing would become a reality, so many people could be forced into living together against their wishes. Those factors must be considered. I should make clear the fact that the target for reusing previously developed land remains at 50 per cent., the same as the previous Government's official target. Although the Green Paper floated a figure of 60 per cent. as an aspirational target, and the UK Round Table on Sustainable Development even suggested 75 per cent., we have not changed the target. The key issue, however, is that, whatever recycling target is proposed, by whatever Government, a certain proportion of growth will still need to take place on green-field sites.",25222,[],Housing,0,40,housing,270

What I have said so far is very general. What does it mean for local areas, for local people in Stroud and the rest of Gloucestershire? As my hon. Friend will know from his time as a Stroud district councillor, Gloucestershire county council is reviewing its structure plan. In that process, it has to take as its starting point the housing requirement figure agreed and published in the regional planning guidance for the south-west. That figure is 53,000 additional dwellings between 1991 and 2011. It was based on the previous set of household projections, not those issued in 1995, which provide the basis for the 4.4 million additional households. The consultation draft Gloucestershire structure plan was published in May 1996. It accepted the regional planning guidance figure of 53,000, and allocated 8,900 additional dwellings to Stroud for the period 1991 to 2011.",25222,[],Housing,0,44,housing,217

1997-11-12,Housing,83,Richard Caborn,Lab,False,"I shall deal with that, too. Following its consideration of the responses to the draft plan, Gloucestershire county council does not intend to proceed further with it. I understand that it is now in the process of preparing a new plan, which it intends to place on deposit for public consultation on 12 January. That plan will be subject to scrutiny at an examination in public, which the council intends to hold next June. That will give everyone concerned about its content an opportunity to question the county's proposals. Stroud district published a local plan consultation document last July, which accepted the housing requirements in the draft structure plan. After taking account of houses built since 1991, existing allocations and an allowance for windfall sites, the council identifies a need to find land for a further 3,800 new dwellings between now and 2011. The consultation draft considers ways in which the requirement could be met, and identifies 12 potential housing sites. I understand that the largest of those, covering about 200 acres in an area of outstanding natural beauty to the north of Stroud, in the Painswick valley, has been very controversial locally. My officials in the Government office for the south-west have commented that the consultation paper did not consider how the proposed development in the Painswick valley could be reconciled with the objectives of designating areas of outstanding natural beauty; nor did it provide any local justification that might override the national importance of the designation. I understand that the district council intends to publish a deposit version of the plan next summer, so my hon. Friend and his constituents will have a further opportunity to make their views known. The district council will have an opportunity to reconsider its proposals, and if it does not, objectors have the right to debate the issue before an inspector at the local plan inquiry. That is a good illustration of the process of checks and balances. The household projections feed into the consideration of housing requirements in regional planning guidance, which, after debate at the regional level, allocates housing requirement figures to the counties. The counties then propose how much housing should be provided for in their areas by district, and that is tested at the examination in public into the structure plans. The structure plan figures are then further tested in the course of producing the district-wide local plans through public consultation, and ultimately at the local plan inquiry. That also shows that it is for local authorities to determine how and where new housing should go. The new housing creates both problems and opportunities. District councils cannot simply decide which field should be developed next, or what sites can be found for redevelopment. The need to look ahead to 2011 ensures that they must address the question of what will prove the most suitable and sustainable pattern of development. The choices must be local, unless there is direct conflict with national policy. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud would agree that is how things should be. I now come to the question that the shadow spokesman, the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) asked about urbanisation. The urbanisation projections should be put into perspective. The most recent projections suggest that the additional housing from 1991 to 2016 would mean only about an extra 1.3 per cent. of the whole of England being urbanised by 2016, bringing urbanisation to a total of 11.9 per cent. It is on that 11.9 per cent. that 88 per cent. of the population would live. That hardly sounds like the concreting over of the countryside that some Members would have us believe is taking place. There would still be as much green belt as urban land. There is growing concern about the green belt, but let me put that into perspective. The green belt has doubled in area over the past 20 years, whereas the amount of land in urban use has increased by just over 10 per cent. in the same period. Four times as much land has been added to the green belt over the past 20 years as we expect to urbanise over the next 20 years. The policy on green belts, however, has not changed. It is in PPG2: there is a presumption against inappropriate development in green belts. However, local authorities have always been able to make changes to the boundaries of green belts through the development plan process. That allows for public participation. If local people consider that the most suitable approach, we must think carefully before intervening. Overall, we have very tight controls on development in this country, with 35 per cent. of our land area designated, as areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks, sites of special scientific interest or other special protection areas. In addition, more than 15 per cent. of land is protected as high-grade agricultural land. The countryside, we believe, is not unprotected. The household projections are at present the only logical starting point for calculating the housing requirements in regional planning guidance and subsequently in development plans. However, they are only projections, incorporating our best understanding of recent social and demographic trends, including migration. They operate on a rolling basis, and can be challenged by local people before they are put into practice.",25222,[],Housing,0,47,housing,887

I place on record the Committee's thanks to our Clerk and specialist adviser and to our advisers Richard Bate, Peter Chapman and Dr. Christine Whitehead, who gave us so much help in preparing our report. I also thank all those who sent in written evidence and those who came before the Committee to answer our questions-we are extremely grateful to them all. Finally, I thank all the members of the Committee, who worked so hard, and I apologise to the House for the fact that my co-Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), is unable to be here today-she is on a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegation. Our inquiry arose out of the previous Government's projection that an extra 4.4 million households would have to be catered for over the next 15 years or so, which represents an increase on the previous projections of about 1 million-that was the key to our inquiry. I was surprised that very few of the people who sent in evidence challenged those figures, even though they raised many other problems. One reason was that there was little detail on how those projections were arrived at. One of the most pleasing aspects of the Government's response was the promise that the next set of projections would include much more detail on how the figures are arrived at, so that there can be much more discussion about whether they are realistic. If the projections are wrong, there will clearly be problems. If too many households are projected, rows of houses in parts of the country may contain empty properties, and it is extremely depressing to live in a road where some houses are uncared for and untended. It is important that we do not over-provide or over-provide in particular parts of the country. Equally, it is important that we do not under-provide. If we do, it is almost certain that house prices will increase, which will mean that many people cannot afford to buy a house, giving rise to an increase in the demand for social housing. Ensuring that the projections are right and meeting those projections are extremely important. The projections show that the extra dwellings that will be needed will be for young single people, for people in middle age who are likely to be living on their own-perhaps through divorce-and, of course, for the increasing number of elderly people. One of the key questions is where those dwellings should go. There has been a great deal of argument about how many of them can go on to what are crudely called brown-field sites-areas of land that have been used previously. First, the Government suggested about 60 per cent, but the Opposition have looked for a rather higher figure than that. There was evidence to the Select Committee that, in some parts of the country, it would be easy to reach a higher target than 60 per cent. I believe that we should be a little cautious about making predictions until we have much better information. One of the most useful things will be Lord Rogers's task force, which will carry out the compilation of a database across the country so that we know how much brown-field land there is. That is fundamental. Until we know how much land there is, we cannot prove how realistic the 60 per cent. target is, or whether a higher target can be reached in some parts of the country. I hope that that information will be available within the next 12 months at least. If there is to be more development on brown-field sites, the Government have to work hard on the issue of contaminated land. The Select Committee on the Environment first looked at contaminated land over 10 years ago, and came up with a series of recommendations. The previous Administration looked at them, rejected them or altered them, but took very little action. I plead with the Government to get on with the regulations for contaminated land. We have to get on with providing the money so that many of the sites can be reclaimed. We will be able to reach a target of 60 per cent. or higher only if we put that in place. We have to look at the way in which local authorities are hoarding land for industry. I made some inquiries around the local authorities in Greater Manchester about the amount of land they have in the hope of attracting industry to it. When one adds up all such land around Greater Manchester, one realises that it would be impossible to attract that amount of industry to the area, and, if that amount of industry could be attracted, there would be no way in which there would be sufficient people to work in it. Local authorities must make much more effort to hold back a realistic amount of land for the creation of jobs, which is extremely important, while releasing some of the land for housing. That would go a long way towards reaching the target of 60 per cent.",28292,[],Housing,0,2,housing,859

However, there is that little phrase, "" as far as possible"". That reasoning has been behind the tradition of green belt land, and the Committee and I did not deviate from that historical view. I must point out that many of the people who gave evidence to the Select Committee did not want housing in their area, but they were still working hard to promote new industries and new jobs. I plead with local authorities, if they are going out to campaign to attract jobs to their area, to accept equal responsibility for providing houses for the people who will carry out that activity. The core of our report is that we need urban regeneration. We need to make our cities and urban areas work. One of our recommendations was that the Government should produce a White Paper. I am glad that, earlier this week, they announced that we will get an urban White Paper. This is not just a matter for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions-the Deputy Prime Minister's Department-but one that goes right across the Government. Regeneration of our cities must include ensuring that the schools are tip-top, and that we deal with crime and the problems that shops face. Regeneration means improving the whole environment, and many Government Departments need to play a part. I therefore hope that the White Paper will not suffer from departmentitis, but will receive full co-operation in its production. If we are to regenerate our cities, we must regenerate some of their old buildings. The Committee was lucky enough to visit Poundbury to see the Prince of Wales's proposals for housing. However, I found more encouraging the work that he is doing with the Heritage Trust to try to bring back into residential use many of the old buildings in our cities. In my constituency, we have the Houldsworth mill project, which I hope succeeds. In the years that I have been in the House, many proposals have been made to bring that fine old mill into residential use, but they never quite made it. I hope that this time will be different. I welcome the Government's response to the issue of revising the planning regulations, but quick action is needed. The Government have given a commitment to revise planning policy guidance note 3 on housing, PPG11 on regional plans and PPG12 on development plans. The release of land for housing is a crucial issue. At the moment, local authority plans have to include a five-year supply. Unless the Government move quickly, the danger is that some builders will race to use green-field sites, knowing that it will be difficult to use them in the future. I hope that the Government can reassure the House that they will move as speedily as possible to revise the planning regulations. I mentioned the probable increased demand for social housing. The Committee was disappointed by the Government's response on social housing, although we may have been a little harsh in our report. The Minister for London and Construction has made his reputation in championing the need for social housing, but his appearance before the Committee was disappointing. I understand that he knew the results of the spending review and we did not, but I reiterate that we need much more social housing than the Government are so far committed to providing. It is a disappointing cop-out to say that it is the responsibility of local authorities. If one local authority attempts to provide social housing, it is often taken up by people from neighbouring authorities that have made no provision. The Government need to set a much more realistic target. The key to the whole process is continuous monitoring. I hope that the Government will report regularly to the House on how much new housing will be built on brown-field sites. It is very important that the Government succeed in regenerating our cities, because that would improve the quality of life for people who live in them, as well as stop the continual spread of housing into the countryside. I hope that we have a good debate on the report, and, more importantly, that we see action from the Government.",28292,[],Housing,0,4,housing,716

1998-10-22,Housing,165,Simon Burns,Con,False,"I congratulate the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), who chairs the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, and his colleagues on a timely, important and interesting report. They have done the House a service. Partly in jest, I find it slightly puzzling that the Deputy Prime Minister should have strongly welcomed the report, given that it contains a number of veiled criticisms of his own actions, both in the text and between the lines. There is a bald statement that the Committee found the answers given to it by one junior Minister to be both "" vacuous and disingenuous"" The report represents a thinly veiled attack on the dithering and inaction that characterise the Government's attitude to housing provision. The Committee's findings vindicate our consistent criticism of the Deputy Prime Minister's failure to address the problem of household growth and of the Government's inability to engage in joined-up thinking on the important issue of housing. The report is a valuable contribution to debate. Although it is in places couched in soft language, it is in many ways a damning indictment of the complacency with which the Government have approached a critical issue. It is a call to arms to those of us on both sides of the House who care about the preservation of the countryside and the regeneration of our towns and cities. I shall take the House through some of the Committee's key findings. I hope that the House will forgive me for indulging in some translation, so that hon. Members who have not had the privilege of reading the report in its entirety may have some of its flavour, stripped of the spin that Ministers and their advisers have sought to put on it. The proposals in the White Paper "" Planning for the Communities of the Future"" are, in the words of the Committee, "" well-intentioned, but vague."" The report states: "" We do not believe they will be adequate to achieve their aims."" In other words, unless the Government decide to do something instead of just talking about the problems, the countryside will be swamped with new developments, and our towns and cities will suffer decay and deprivation. The report is certainly a long way short of the ringing endorsement to which the Deputy Prime Minister laid claim on Monday. The report repeatedly stresses the need for a brown-field development target of 60 per cent. or more, to be applied as soon as possible. The Committee supports "" an interim national target...of at least 60 per cent., which should be applied in the coming round of Regional Planning Guidance, rather than over 10 years as the Government has proposed."" If I may take the liberty of paraphrasing once again, unless the Government decide to do something instead of just talking, the green belt will not be saved, and our towns and cities will continue to be scarred by derelict sites. Again, that seems to fall short of the endorsement heralded by the Secretary of State. The report continues: "" It is important that the target set should be challenging, e. g. 60 per cent. or higher-some witnesses thought 75 per cent. was possible"". For the Government to state-as the Deputy Prime Minister did on Monday-that that constitutes support for the Government's 60 per cent. target is, to coin a phrase, both vacuous and disingenuous. Our manifesto at the general election stated that we would set a target of more than 60 per cent. We have since pressed the Government to fix a target of two thirds. I hope that the Minister can rise to announce that, in the light of the Select Committee's evidence, he will increase the target to two thirds with immediate effect. The report is not just critical of what the Deputy Prime Minister has not done. It attacks what little he has done to discharge his duties-for example, in relation to the task force which he set up under Lord Rogers. The report states: "" We are concerned as to whether the Task Force will be able to undertake the wide range of tasks it has been set ... It must not be used as a means of causing delay."" Again, the implication is clear. The Committee believes what Conservative Members have long suspected: as with so many other task forces and reviews set up over the past 18 months, the Government see this as a way of kicking the ball into the long grass and hoping that the problem will go away.",28292,[],Housing,0,7,housing,758

Gentleman's point, but it is important not to overlook the fact that, at the same time during that time scale, my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) was determined to ensure that more and more building was done on brown-field sites when it was feasible, so as to protect and preserve the countryside and green-field sites. The Committee states: "" Central government must support local authorities when they restrict the use of green-field sites."" Does the Deputy Prime Minister now accept that he was wrong on the principle of the issue to force West Sussex county council to cater for an extra 13,000 homes in its local plans, flying in the face of opposition from all three parties on the county council and of the advice of the planning inspectorate? When the Minister replies, perhaps he will care to tell the House this, despite the answer which the Under-Secretary of State used as a dodge at Question Time on Tuesday to avoid the issue. To get away from the niceties of the sub judice rule that the Under-Secretary used, I am asking whether the Minister would care to answer the question on the principle rather than on the individual case. How can that decision be squared with the words of the Select Committee and the Deputy Prime Minister's support for the report? How can such developments be squared with the recommendations and the Government's own rhetoric on transport? In particular, can the Minister explain how allowing major developments on green-field sites away from shops and other facilities contributes to the aim of reducing the need to travel? To judge from these glaring inconsistencies, the Government are scarcely capable of joined-up writing, let alone joined-up thinking, on the issue. The Committee adds its voice to our own and the voices of numerous other interested bodies in calling for urgent revision to the Department's planning guidance notes, particularly PPG3 and PPG13. The Government have said that they intend to issue new guidance, and we welcome the commitment given in the Government's response to the report on Monday. The report rightly states that, without a clear planning framework, "" there will be uncertainty and the likelihood that in some regions the Government's policies on urban regeneration, integrated transport and sustainability will be ignored."" When can we expect to see this new guidance? Does the Minister have any news for us on that during this debate? Why, when the Deputy Prime Minister announced the 60 per cent. target as long ago as February, has there been no movement so far to start giving effect to that target? He increasingly resembles an archer with only a small target to aim at and a quiver as empty as his rhetoric. The means to replace his stock of arrows are within his own power and the longer he delays, the more people will suspect that he does not want to start shooting at all. The report also calls for the Government to announce a strategy for meeting the target set by the previous Government for reducing the amount of empty property, and to issue advice to local authorities. I take the opportunity to add our voice to that of the Select Committee and remind the Government that Labour-controlled councils currently have the highest proportion of stock awaiting letting. The 10 authorities with the highest proportion of properties ready for letting or awaiting minor repairs are all, not unexpectedly, Labour-controlled. Perhaps the Minister would like to tell us what plans the Government have to make sure that Labour councils bring their performance into line with that achieved by Conservative councils. Is he aware that the number of vacant dwellings is rising? There are now some 80,000 vacant dwellings under local authority management, accounting for almost 2.5 per cent. of the stock. How do the Government propose to tackle that major and growing problem? Local authorities and the framework within which they operate will play a key role in determining the success of any strategy to bring more brown-field sites into use.",28292,[],Housing,0,11,housing,686

1998-10-22,Housing,171,Simon Burns,Con,False,"I am sorry-I will not give way, because time is short and so many other hon. Members wish to speak. The Government may rest assured that Conservative councillors will continue to protect the green belt against development as long as they are not further hindered by decisions from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Conservative councillors in towns and cities will continue to urge the reuse of derelict sites and the clean-up of contaminated land. What measures does the Minister plan to introduce to ensure consistency across the planning system to give effect to the target of 60 per cent. of building on brown-field sites? Are the Government prepared to use their influence with the Labour-run authorities in our towns and cities, which control much of the brown land in question, to ensure that local authorities play their part in freeing brown-field sites for housing purposes? How does the Minister intend to encourage local authorities to allow brown land currently designated for industrial or commercial use to be used instead for residential purposes where feasible? At present, planning law entitles local authorities to ask for contributions from developers towards the cost of overcoming genuine planning obstructions, such as widening road junctions or expanding the capacity of local schools. Conservative councillors will continue to seek fair agreements with developers for the joint funding of necessary local improvements. Some local authorities allegedly abuse the system in order to finance unrelated spending. I understand that one local authority even demanded a contribution towards play areas from developers who were providing sheltered housing for the elderly. Such abuse discourages would-be developers from making applications to use brown-field sites. What will the Government do to prevent such seemingly sharp practices? What line do the Government plan to take on the draft EU rules that will bar public bodies from contributing to pollution clean-up, and will insist that all land be returned to its natural state, regardless of its end use? When will the Government fix parameters for pollution clean-up, so that developers and local authorities know exactly where they stand? The Government's response to the report is a poor attempt to paint it as an endorsement of their approach. That claim is not supported by a careful reading of the report. In fact, as the Deputy Prime Minister said on Monday, pretty much everybody claims to agree with the basic principles that we need more sustainable patterns of development and that we should minimise the use of green-field sites and maximise reuse of brown-field sites. The report exposes the hypocrisy of a Government who purport to defend the countryside and promote urban regeneration, while all the time taking decisions such as that in West Sussex, which undermine and frustrate their declared aims. When the report was published, Friends of the Earth stated: "" the Select Committee has not been fooled by John Prescott's vague rhetoric."" The Government's response represents more of the same. The Select Committee was not fooled then, and I assure Ministers that the House will not be fooled now. The Government's response is woefully inadequate. Its so-called strategy for meeting demand for new housing has been exposed as a sham. It is a catalogue of delay, indecision and downright incompetence. Instead of trying to paint a gloss over the report and paper over the cracks in their failed approach, the Government should go back to the drawing board and urgently consider relaying the entire foundations of their strategy to meet the problems facing the countryside and urban regeneration.",28292,[],Housing,0,13,housing,589
1998-10-22,Housing,172,Christine Butler,Lab,False,"The hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) has not moved the debate further on-indeed, it has been stripped of context. He has not given due consideration to the Government's response to the Select Committee report-a response that was broadly welcomed by Labour Members. The big strategy of sustainability is one that we must all endorse. To move matters on, it is up to all of us to engage in debate on the detail of how to implement that strategy. The Government and the Select Committee require sustainability to be at the heart of the debate-sustainability in respect of environmental, social and economic concerns. I urge the Government, when considering local authority planning application assessments, to give as much weight to social and economic criteria as to environmental criteria. That is extremely important, because, if we are not careful, the debate will shift in favour of the environmental agenda, which must not be considered in isolation from the social and economic agendas. A big issue that has not yet been properly addressed, but which is all too evident, is the existence of huge regional differences in need and capacity. There is an enormous difference between north and south in general, but I should like to highlight the case of the south-east, where some of the biggest problems are found. The expected provision in that area is approximately one third of the 4.4 million new homes that have to be built. That is a pretty tall order. I welcome the so-called brown-field task force, although I would prefer the term "" previously used land"" to "" brown field"", as I do not think the latter term is appropriate. The task force has been set up to examine urban capacity for regeneration needs, especially in the London area. The problem is one not merely of providing more housing, but of creating balanced communities. It is important to pay attention to all an area's needs-economic, social and environmental. Ringing the London region are commuter districts. The majority of my constituents commute to their jobs. If that carries on, it will become unsustainable in terms of both transport and the provision of social housing. I welcome some of the comments in the Government's response, but one or two issues need further detailed examination. In the context of fiscal strategies, there is a real need to redefine conversions, even though the Government would encounter great difficulty with the European Commission, and there would be a prolonged debate about the equalisation of the value added tax regime between new build and conversions. However, if it is at all possible to redefine conversions in the context of the need for new housing, it might bear down on the existing 17.5 per cent. VAT levy. That would be a great achievement. A further issue with which we must take great care-one which Friends of the Earth and others might push without giving it proper consideration-is that of the green-field levy. It sounds like a great idea, especially if the money was to be put into brown-field site conversion and solving the problems that exist there. However, although I do not want the Government to abandon the idea, it should be a less immediate priority and the Government should give further consideration to the pros and cons of imposing such a levy. Of the greatest urgency and importance are the new planning policy guidance notes. Already, local authorities are proposing and adopting plans, and regional planning conferences are at various stages of reporting and adoption. If we do not get the new PPGs in soon, we shall leave ourselves open to speculative developments on green-field land.",28292,[],Housing,0,14,housing,607

The lack of attention paid to the issues dealt with by the Committee and to the smaller points that I am highlighting now is what really matters. We know what the figures are. There has already been speculative interest in green-field sites in my constituency. The authority would like to reject that, but cannot do so, because of legal niceties. In 1951, a certain site received planning permission for mixed-use, retail and housing development. Try as it might, since that time the authority has been unable to reallocate land use policy in that area, even though the circumstances in the constituency and the wider region have changed dramatically. Why is the authority unable to act? The answer is that a road was built-one road through the whole site, with the result that the site holds developers' interest unfairly. That is why I welcome a hint in the proposed PPG3 that the Government might be able to strengthen local authorities' resolve when applications for renewal are made. Perhaps huge compensation need not be payable to the inheritors of the land when the local authority can prove that the application is unsuitable. There should be a further requirement: if a proposal has not been entirely developed within a certain period, it fails, and a new application is required. The nonsense of digging a trench or laying a bit of tarmac on a site should no longer be accepted. There is a loophole, and I urge my hon.

It would be wise if I did not give way again because of the danger of spurious remarks distracting the House from the important points that I shall make. It is good to hear that those on the Government Front Bench are particularly verbal and volatile today-that always means that one is dealing with points that worry them. Clearly they are concerned about what I shall say and they are trying to stop me saying it, but I shall not be deterred. I have challenged the acceptance of the figures regardless of which Government proposed them. I am not afraid to say that I would challenge a Conservative Government if we were in office. Unfortunately we are not, so I am challenging the Labour Government to question the figures. I will not dwell on that point. If we accept the figure of 4.4 million homes, it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy and we should consider how it will affect the south-west, where 438,000 houses are to be built. The Devon structure plan, which includes my constituency, proposed 90,500 homes. That was not enough, and after a public inquiry, the figure was raised to 95,000. The South Hams, which comprises the majority of my constituency, will have 13,500 additional new dwellings by 2011. That is curious because the House of Commons Library concluded that my constituency is one of the most beautiful in Britain. It did so by examining the number of environmental beauty categories into which the Totnes and South Hams area falls. It has the heritage coastline, areas of great landscape value, areas of outstanding natural beauty, sites of special scientific interest, the Dartmoor national park, conservation areas and so on. How could 13,500 houses be built in such an area without destroying green fields or eating into special environmentally protected areas? Furthermore, it is said that a further 300 acres is needed for employment land and, within the area covered by Devon county council, 3,000 acres is needed for employment land. It is argued that new homes will be required to house the existing population. I challenge that. We are told that the vast increase in the number of houses is simply necessary to provide for a larger number of individual households, mainly because of divorce, which will create a need for 40 per cent. of the new homes. In addition, 30 per cent. of the new homes are needed because people live longer and another 30 per cent. are needed for young people who leave home and move around the country for work purposes. I was told that the housing projection for the South Hams is intended to rehouse people who already live there. I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to this point. In 1981, the population of South Hams was 69,993. By 1997, the number had risen to 80,200-an increase of about 18 per cent. By contrast, the population in the whole county of Devon increased by 5 per cent. only. It cannot be that more than 90,000 new houses are needed to redistribute the existing population if there are dramatic increases in population numbers. The population increase in the South Hams has been out of all proportion to that in the county and in the south-west. In no way is that redistribution; it is plain inward migration. More houses are needed because people come from other places with their families, pets and motor cars to live in Devon, not because overcrowded households need more space. In the three months ending March 1998, 8,233 additional people moved into the county. Since 1988, 8,000 people have been moving into the county every three months. Only during the economic crisis in 1991 did the figure drop. That means that 32,000 people move to Devon every year. That is why the new houses are needed-not to rehouse local people, which is entirely another matter. The county council says that 90,000 new houses are required for local people. That is not true; it is a figment of the planners' and statisticians' imaginations. My experience supports that. On Saturday afternoons when I have little else to do, I knock on doors at random. That is one of my hobbies, and I should declare it as an interest. Oddly, I find that most of the people whose doors I knock on are newcomers, not people who have moved from other parts of Devon. Adding to the population rather than redistributing it creates enormous pressure on the local infrastructure. For example, the building of new houses has been banned in Dartmouth because the sewerage system cannot cope. In Ivybridge, the sewerage system is backing up because so many people use it and the facilities are not sufficient. The Government's housing projections, if implemented, would destroy tens of thousands of acres of green-field land, but in the South Hams they will eat into the special categories of beauty that the House of Commons Library has highlighted as particularly important. One of the greatest ironies is that the very beauty that attracts people to my constituency will be destroyed by the buildings that they are intending to occupy. Who is running the county council? I am afraid that it is the Liberals. Who is running the Torbay unitary authority that governs part of my constituency? Again, it is the Liberals. Who is running the South Hams district council? I am afraid that it is the Liberals. On 30 July, the Liberal county council whipped in all its councillors to attend a debate on the structure plan. They approved the Government's structure plan for the building of 90,000 new houses, despite strong opposition from the Conservatives. That occurred on the afternoon of 30 July. In the evening of 30 July, the Liberals launched a campaign opposing the 90,000 figure that they had approved that afternoon. They are now running around Devon organising meetings and campaigning against the proposal that they passed on the afternoon of 30 July. That is a good Liberal story, is it not? The Liberals talk about sustainable development, but those 90,000 houses are unsustainable. They talk about environmental sensitivity, but they are not the least bit sensitive to the environment. I must now conclude. I am glad that Labour Members have enjoyed my comments and are ready to respond to them. I propose a solution to the problem. The Government could ask the local authorities in Devon to agree on a sustainable figure. The Liberals on the Devon county council said that they passed the Government's structure plan because they feared that, if they did not, the Government would increase the figure. If the Government would tell Devon county council, "" We will not increase the number of houses, so go back to the other local authorities and come up with a figure that you think is sustainable"", the Government would not have to call in the plan. That outcome is inevitable, as the plan would have disastrous consequences in a county as beautiful as Devon-and certainly in the South Hams. My proposal amounts to a more democratic way of handling the matter. When the Minister replies perhaps he could consider what I believe is a very sensible approach: asking the local authorities to provide a more sustainable figure. I am most grateful, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I hope that my comments have been helpful to the House.",28292,[],Housing,0,26,housing,1237

I compliment Committee members on the huge amount of work that they have undertaken in compiling the report. I understand that they have seen at least 30 sets of witnesses and received more than 200 memorandums. It has greatly assisted those hon. Members, like myself, who do not serve on the Committee to see the depth of consideration that Committee members have given to these important issues. Contrary to the assertions made by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), I consider the report to be an example of joined-up thinking and joined-up government. It raises issues regarding not just housing but the sustainable development of communities. It will ensure that new housing developments take account of environmental and transport factors. A key recommendation in the report is that housing should be located close to people's places of employment so that they do not have to travel great distances to work. That recommendation is essential to regenerating our towns and cities. The report is a good example of cross-departmental thinking and it begins to touch on many important issues. It also echoes many of the recommendations in the report of the social exclusion unit, "" Bringing Communities Together"". We must tackle some very serious issues, not simply housing matters, if we are to regenerate and renew many inner-city areas. In the limited time available, I shall concentrate on the Committee's recommendations regarding urban areas and inner cities because my constituency is one of the poorest and most deprived inner-city areas in the country. In inner cities our problems are not about a shortage of land, but more about the breakdown of families and communities and the wholesale migration of owner-occupiers, leaving behind dereliction and decay. That is a very difficult issue to tackle in the long term. I believe that housing must play a major role in urban regeneration. Housing constitutes 80 per cent. of development and is the key to improving our communities. We must bring empty properties back into use. The report's recommendations regarding harmonisation of value added tax on renovations and conversions are crucial. We must ensure that, as far as possible, there is a level playing field for new developments and conversions. There are several problem areas in Salford which illustrate some of the difficulties that the report tries to tackle. I shall touch briefly on some of them. The Broughton area has a huge problem with small terraced housing. There has been an influx of private landlords, and owner-occupiers have moved out of the city. Indiscriminate letting policies of housing associations and private landlords have produced nuisance tenants who have driven out the majority of good, decent people who formerly lived in those communities. We are beginning to regenerate the area. A joint single regeneration budget project with our neighbours in Manchester is working well, but it is difficult to encourage private developers to help us. I am delighted that the report highlights the action by English Partnerships to provide incentives and gap funding for developers to encourage them into our inner-city areas. Their assistance is crucial if we are to stabilise our communities and give local people some hope that things will change and improve. We must convince them to stay in our inner cities. The recommendation for sequential planning consideration, whereby developers must show that they have considered using previously developed land before they are allowed to develop new sites, will be incredibly helpful in inner-city areas. However, we must question the future of small terraced housing. I received a letter only this week from a constituent in Kersal, which is an area of such housing. It is just one example of the hundreds of letters that I receive on this subject. My constituent explains that she is the owner of a two-bedroom terraced property which she cannot sell. She believes that the main problem lies with builders and property developers who are flinging up estates of semi-detached homes with carpets, curtains and gardens which cost about the same as her terraced property. Many first-time buyers are opting for those new starter homes rather than the traditional terraced housing. That leaves us with the real problem of how to encourage occupation in many such areas. Wholesale slum clearance is clearly not an option: it is too expensive and it destroys communities. However, in many parts of the north there is a real question about the relevance of terraced housing. Another part of the city that has suffered huge problems in recent years is Seedley and Langworthy, where all of the problems of our inner cities-crime, unemployment and poor education-coalesce. We have produced a Seedley and Langworthy action plan which is designed to tackle those problems. Housing is a key regeneration factor and relies on the concept of a partnership of local people. That partnership is led by the community and involves business, voluntary groups, housing associations and a private developer. We have also almost persuaded a building society to join us to talk about how it can contribute to housing regeneration. Building societies are notoriously reluctant to become involved in regeneration, and I am particularly proud that we have been able to secure that assistance. The action plan for Seedley and Langworthy is not just about housing; it is about education, health and jobs. It proposes the establishment of a community housing company so that local people can determine who lives in the area and how best to achieve regeneration. It is a 10-year plan because we recognise that many problems will not be solved overnight: we will require improvements, year on year. However, local people are determined to tackle the existing problems. There are just 3,000 homes in the area, and 600 of them are empty. They have been boarded and bricked up or torched and left derelict and in decay because good, decent families have been driven out by crime and other inner-city problems. We must bring those properties back into beneficial use: that is the key to sustainable regeneration. We must also tackle the problem of private landlords. The report says that the private rented sector has acted as a safety valve. That might be true in some areas, but the private rented sector in Salford is the source of much deterioration and decay. My heart sinks whenever I see a "" For Rent"" sign in my constituency because I know that it signals that another area is in decline. The owner-occupiers have gone and the absentee landlords and nuisance neighbours have arrived. I know that they will drive people out and that we will see properties boarded up, bricked up and torched. It is almost a logical progression. We must break that cycle of decay that is apparent in so many inner-city areas. I have written to Ministers requesting regulations governing licensing. I would like to see housing benefit sanctions applied to some absent landlords-there is nothing more effective than hitting them in the pocket. Absentee landlords receive housing benefit and they do not care to whom they rent their properties. They do not manage their properties properly and they are not responsible landlords. I am not referring to every private landlord, but in many parts of my constituency a great deal of that goes on. The city has a voluntary registration scheme for landlords and about 50 per cent. of them have signed up, but it is the good ones who sign up, the bad ones do not want to be involved. They do not want to be responsible for their properties. The issue must be tackled. Housing benefit sanctions, although difficult to impose, would concentrate minds wonderfully and I urge Ministers to consider them seriously. We have a lot of hope in Salford. Although there are many problems, we are tackling them together. There is a long way to go, but the provision of decent, safe, warm, affordable and high-quality housing will be the key to our city's renewal and the urban renaissance that is categorised in the report. I welcome the prospect of an urban White Paper which will bring together our thinking across a range of Departments and provide a key and catalyst to urban regeneration. Cities can be exciting and vibrant places. It is not true that the countryside is the rural idyll and that cities are bad places to live-they can be full of life, the arts and culture. They can have a real buzz. I want my city to have that buzz and to come up from the bottom. We have reached rock bottom and there is only one direction in which to go. We are coming up and fighting back, and I know that the Labour Government will give us the best chance that we have had for the past 20 or 30 years to regenerate our city and make Salford a better place to live, work and bring up families. We are determined to work on it together.",28292,[],Housing,0,27,housing,1507
1998-10-22,Housing,186,Tom Brake,LibDem,False,"I welcome the topical nature of the housing report and part if not all of the Government's response to it. However, I should like to highlight some issues on which I feel that the Government's response is weak or possibly unhelpful. First, let me turn to the housing projection figures. The report calls the estimate of 4.4 million new homes "" the best one there is"", yet in a report in The Guardian on Monday, senior Government sources are quoted as saying that 5 million new homes would be a more realistic estimate. If that is the view of senior Government sources, and given that it will be significantly harder to identify sites for that increased number of new homes, it should be out in the open and not hidden away in the inside pages of The Guardian. Secondly, on the national target for development on brown-field sites, and perhaps anticipating the contribution from Conservative Members, who no doubt will be calling for a target that is higher than 60 per cent., it is worth reminding the House of their record in government. Under the Tories, an average of about six in 10 homes were built on green-field sites, so the shadow Minister was right the first time when he said that the Tory Government were intent on developing more homes on green-field sites. It is a pity that they have discovered only recently that there is more to be gained by defending the countryside than by building all over it. The Liberal Democrats do not consider a 60 per cent. target for development on brown-field land to be particularly ambitious. If the right policies were in place, more could be achieved. For instance, the Council for the Protection of Rural England argues that the capacity of cities and towns for new housing is a matter of policy rather than physical constraint. The 60 per cent. target should be an interim target, a stepping stone to a tougher target of 75 per cent. Thirdly, there is the problem of defining brown-field land. The Government need to refine their definition and make a distinction between sites previously used for housing or industrial developments and ex-MOD land, such as abandoned airfields, which may mostly comprise of green fields. Establishing a new category of land in the development hierarchy, which we have dubbed taupe-field, would enable such sites to be considered for development after consideration of recycled land. The definition could include, for instance, land adjacent to an out-of-town development or situated by a road of at least B status or used for specific purposes. The development hierarchy would then prioritise conversion of old buildings; then development on brown-field sites; then taupe-field sites; and, finally, green-field sites. That might help to defuse the controversies surrounding proposed developments, such as the proposal for 50,000 new homes on ex-MOD airfields near Cambridge. The new definition would also address some of the Select Committee's concerns that, "" by promoting Brownfield land, regardless of its location, we continue to encourage unsustainable forms of settlement."" Fourthly, a new planning policy guidance note 3 must be issued without delay. It is the simplest means of ensuring that the desired changes to planning policy are implemented forthwith. Otherwise, building on green-field land will continue apace. The Government must provide a firm date by which it is to be published. The Department's best estimate today was that it would be some time early next year. I encourage the Minister to give a more precise date. Fifthly, one must consider the role of the regional planning conferences which are to spearhead the Government's approach to the provision of future housing. I agree with the CPRE that there is no demonstrable commitment to move away from the policy of "" predict and provide"". The regional planning conferences have apparently received no advice on how to plan other than according to that policy. They are under-resourced and lack any statutory basis, so they are ill-equipped to deliver the Government's strategy of "" plan, monitor and manage"". Sixthly, other hon. Members have mentioned the need to reduce migration. I agree with the Government that strong urban development is needed to slow down or stop net out-migration and that there is a key role for the regional development agencies. I support the policy, but we need a clear statement from the Government on whether the improvements to health, education and transport will be delivered regardless of the economic downturn and its effect on Government spending plans. The provision of better hospitals, schools and transport in urban areas would help to stop that migration. There is one last area to consider that has been touched on today-tax reform and financial incentives. Tax changes could influence dramatically developers' choice of green-field or brown-field sites, but I fear that the Government have yet to take action. For instance, on the green-field development levy, the Government "" is considering the use of economic instruments to further our planning objectives"" but no decision has yet been taken as to whether to proceed. I find that response disappointing.",28292,[],Housing,0,28,housing,846
1998-10-22,Housing,187,James Gray,Con,False,"Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if a levy were charged on building a house on a green-field site, the price of those houses would go up to take account of the tax? That would provide an incentive to those who wish to build executive-style homes in out-of-town development areas, so a green-field levy would have the opposite effect to the one the hon. Gentleman describes.",28292,[],Housing,0,29,housing,66
1998-10-22,Housing,188,Tom Brake,LibDem,False,"That is not necessarily the case, particularly in locations where there is direct competition between building on green-field sites and building on brown-field sites. The competitive nature of the market will ensure that those house prices remain broadly the same. The figures supplied by the Civic Trust suggest that some Â£200 million per annum could be raised by a 10 per cent. levy on green-field land values. If 75 per cent. of that money were spent on cleaning up contaminated land, the remaining Â£50 million per annum would purchase nearly 15,000 acres of arable land, which I understand from the Library is the equivalent of 53 Hyde parks. Each year we could purchase that quantity of land on the back of the green-field development levy and provide green lungs in urban and rural areas. There is also the VAT anomaly. Why should people pay 17.5 per cent. on the conversion of properties and no VAT on new build? The Government's response is mixed. In response to an Adjournment debate, Helen Liddell commented that the VAT issue is complex, and a reduced rate could only be applied to social housing, not all housing.",28292,[],Housing,0,30,housing,192

1998-10-22,Housing,190,Tom Brake,LibDem,False,"The then Economic Secretary to the Treasury, now the Minister of State, Scottish Office, with responsibility for education and industry, said that in March. She felt that the move would result in taxation loss and was not convinced by it. A few months later, in May 1998, a junior Environment Minister said that a refurbishment VAT cut was under consideration. In their response to the report, the Government say that "" unifying VAT would help to provide a more level playing field for conversions"". There is clearly a need for a statement from the Government on their stance in relation to the VAT anomaly, and whether they intend to remove it. There are almost 800,000 empty homes and 800,000 potential homes in England situated in buildings suitable for redevelopment. That underlines the importance of evening out the anomaly as soon as possible. There is also the matter of roll-over capital gains tax. As hon. Members may be aware, there is a loophole that allows farmers to purchase additional land and thereby to escape capital gains tax. That encourages building and tax evasion. Site value rating is a subject close to Liberal Democrat hearts, which we like to mention when the opportunity arises. Will the Government consider replacing the uniform business rate with site value rating, a system that taxes the value of land rather than the use made of it? That would encourage landowners to make use of their land, rather than leaving it derelict. Finally, I accept that limited progress is being made on maximising development on brown-field sites, but the Government must move further and faster. With 110 sq km of countryside disappearing under concrete every year, every week's delay in implementing the Government's new policy means that a further 2 sq km of countryside are lost for ever. If they continue to procrastinate, the Government's legacy to future generations will be row after row of identikit homes marching across down and vale.

1998-10-22,Housing,191,Louise Ellman,Lab,False,"The Select Committee's support for the Government's proposal that at least 60 per cent. of new homes should be provided on brown-field sites arises from a view of housing as a critical part of regeneration, and of regeneration as linked to jobs, training, transport, environment and the provision of social amenities. The key question is whether we have the mechanisms and policies to achieve that in the shortest possible time. We are in a period of great change. We are embarking on a policy of integrated regional strategies. We are doing that through the creation of regional development agencies-which, I remind the Opposition, were strongly opposed by them-and through the development of regional chambers. In the draft guidance to regional development agencies published earlier this week, they are asked to adopt an integrated approach to the economy, employment, social exclusion and physical decay. The strategy is to be drawn up in co-operation with the regional chambers. For the first time there is a clear statement, guidance and structure for a regional policy on integrated development, to improve housing, the economy and the environment. I must, however, express concern about the regional planning conferences, which are to assume increasing importance. Can the Minister assure me that the guidance given to regional planning conferences will ensure that they act in harmony with the regional economic strategies to be developed by the agency in co-operation with the elected regional chamber?",28292,[],Housing,0,33,housing,237

1998-10-22,Housing,193,Louise Ellman,Lab,False,"I am sorry, but, in view of the time constraints, I cannot. Exciting regeneration is currently under way in Everton, a deprived part of my constituency-an area where there is much dereliction, male unemployment stands at 37.5 per cent., and 80 per cent. of pupils in the partnership area involved are eligible for free school meals. Hope university college is spearheading a multimillion pound investment, transforming the disused area of the listed St. Francis Xavier school and the site around it into a major centre for arts, drama and economic development, together with accommodation. Nearby, the private sector is converting the listed disused Collegiate school into flats for sale, and near there the Riverside housing association is converting a disused listed Georgian terrace into a mixed-use development-shops, offices and flats-for a combination of rent and shared ownership. The result of all that activity is the provision of much-needed homes on brown-field sites, educational opportunities, jobs and an improved environment, giving hope to people currently living in an abandoned and largely derelict area. Achieving that development has been a complex task. A wide variety of funding sources have been called on-for example, English Partnerships, European funding, the Housing Corporation, the college and private sector funding. Much has been achieved, but how much more could be achieved there and in similar areas if we had a comprehensive policy, with the mechanisms available for that policy to be used for inner-city regeneration? The steps that could be taken include reducing the 17.5 per cent. VAT on conversions, recognising the need to plan for and provide affordable housing, dealing with land assembly and contamination, recognising the new regional development agencies as an important resource for the locality, and harnessing public and private sector funding. I see much that is encouraging in recent Government policy statements. The document "" Fair deal for communities"" and the report on a new approach to deprived neighbourhoods advocate joined-up thinking in situations of social breakdown. I am encouraged by the announcement of a new urban White Paper by the Secretary of State earlier this week, which shows that we are ready to adopt such thinking as part of mainstream policy. In that way we can meet housing need to its maximum on brown-field sites, regenerate the inner cities and build a new future for communities in an economically and environmentally sustainable way.",28292,[],Housing,0,35,housing,393
1998-10-22,Housing,194,James Gray,Con,False,"It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman). Several other colleagues who have served with me on the Environment Committee over the past 18 months have spoken in the debate. May I pay particular tribute to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), who puts up with our personal foibles and our use of hyperbole on some occasions with remarkable good humour and tolerance? All members of the Committee are grateful to him for it. It must be a particularly difficult job to be the Darby to the formidable Joan supplied by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), who is sorry that she cannot be in the Chamber today for the debate, but who approaches the issues that we discuss in the Select Committee with a refreshing robustness of mind. That is reflected in the report, which goes to such great lengths to criticise-fairly heavily in some parts-what the Government have done. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich would be the first to acknowledge that she was ready to do so, were she in her place this afternoon. The criticism in the report is slightly unusual, as most of our discussion tends to achieve virtual unanimity. The report was agreed unanimously by the Committee. Despite the cross-party banter that we have heard this afternoon, the issues that we are discussing are issues which we as a nation must examine, and are not essentially party political. On the number of houses that we will require between now and 2016, I do not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen), who went to great lengths to rubbish-a rather unpleasant word-the figures. In Committee, I went to some length to try to find holes in the figures produced by my former colleagues, the excellent civil servants in the Department of the Environment, but no amount of effort on my part could produce an argument to show that 4.4 million was necessarily wrong. Indeed, I was horrified to discover that the likelihood was that the figure might even be higher than 4.4 million new households, based on the statistical projections which were being used. It is probably not all that sensible at the start of the debate to assert that the figures are wrong. They appear to be correct, as far as statistical projections can be correct. A more interesting question is why there will be 4.4 million new houses. The answer, as my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes said, is primarily the breakdown of families, which is accelerating at such an alarming rate, and because children are tending to wish to leave home earlier than they did when I was a youngster. My experience was that one stayed at home until 21, as I did when I was at university; I stayed at home to begin with in Glasgow and thereafter moved to a bedsit for a number of years. I would never have contemplated having a flat or a house probably until I was well married and into my 30s. Indeed, I did not own any property until I was 35. That frame of mind has perhaps changed. People nowadays tend to leave home much earlier and then to demand from the nation some form of accommodation at the age of 16. I do not believe that that is right. I do not necessarily believe that society should provide enough houses to accommodate all of the tragedies that come about as a result of family breakdown. If we were to restrict to a degree the availability of new housing in the places where people wanted to be, youngsters might be encouraged to stay at home for a little longer. That might even help some families to stay together which otherwise would fall to pieces, given the availability of somewhere else to go. Leaving aside the number of houses that are required, we must make better use of the houses that are currently available. At April 1997, there were 767,000 empty homes in Britain, most of them in the private sector. Of that total, 81,000 were local authority homes, a large proportion being controlled by the Labour party, which must look to its own front gardens before it does anything else. There were 27,000 empty housing association homes and 19,000 empty homes belonging to other public sector bodies, mainly health authorities and the armed services. Most of that accommodation-767,000 homes-is usable. The previous Government produced targets to reduce that total stock of usable empty housing by 3 per cent. per annum. I challenge the new Government, who are so proud of what they are doing in areas such as housing, to better the previous Government's targets. If they believe that they can do that, let us see them doing it. For example, what about 5 per cent? Perhaps they might start with some of their socialist friends. For example, my Labour-controlled local authority in Swindon has a significant number of empty homes. It is important that the Government look first to their own laurels. In that context, is it not extraordinary that in Newcastle recently permission was given for 2,500 new houses to be built on green-field sites despite the fact that in the centre of the city 4,000 lettable properties were empty? Why do we not fill empty lettable properties in Newcastle first before we give planning permission for 2,500 homes to be built on the green belt surrounding the city? Making better use of existing stock will not happen by chance. We can force local authorities, housing associations and private owners to make better use of existing stock only if we restrict the availability of new stock. If developers are constantly providing new stock in addition to the nation's current stock of housing, people will go to live in the new stock. If we say to developers, Look, you have a choice; you can either build on a green-field site or in the inner city"", they will build on green-field sites. After all, it is so much cheaper and the homes will sell so much better. People want-wrongly, I think-to live in suburban Britain on a green-field site. The only way in which we shall persuade developers to redevelop inner cities is physically to restrict the amount of green-field land that is available to them. As long as that land is available to them, they will use it. We must find ways of restricting much more heavily the use of green-field land that surrounds our cities. In my constituency, there is a proposal-it has been put up by the socialist local authority in Swindon-for 17,500 new houses to be built on the land between Swindon and Wootton Bassett. However, the centre of Swindon-an old railway town-is entirely run down and a huge amount of redevelopment is necessary. People will go into the centre of the town if we say that the rural buffer zone that currently surrounds Swindon is as powerful as the green belt would be and developers may not build within it. I welcome the Government's response to rural buffer zones and other local designations. It would seem that the Government may move towards giving such zones and designations the same power in law as green belt land. I issue a word of caution on brown-field land. It seems that there is a slight pre-supposition that all brown-field sites may be built upon. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) mentioned Ministry of Defence sites, and in my constituency I have several redundant Royal Air Force and Army sites. It would be wrong to build houses on those sites because they are green-field sites. They are in the middle of the countryside and there is no infrastructure attached to them. There are no shops, pubs, schools or roads. There is no nothing. They are, to all intents and purposes, green-field sites. The fact that they were used for something else should not be a presumption that they should be built upon. The Government have not responded to the points made in the Select Committee's report about villages. At risk of being called a NIMBY, I shall refer to my village of Slaughterford in Wiltshire. It is a tiny hamlet within which there are 30 residents. It is proposed to build 14 executive-style homes in the village.",28292,[],Housing,0,36,housing,1396

The Minister must come to visit me at Slaughterford. I shall try to lay on the best hospitality that I can when he does so. If the Minister comes to Slaughterford he will find a hamlet which has been untouched for 100 years. There are 30 people living in it. However, there is a proposal to build 14 executive-style homes at a cost of Â£600,000 each on a disused mill site in the village. Slaughterford has no roads save two miles of single track needed to get there. There is no public transport and there is no school, no pub and no shop. There is nothing at all. There are a few tiny properties and there is the proposal to build the new houses on the mill site. The developers are using the Government's response to the Select Committee and their talk about brown-field sites as a possible excuse to build the new homes. I say that villages should be built on only when local people have the need of somewhere to live. I think particularly of the children of agricultural workers, who need to stay in the villages. They are local people and they need to live locally. That is fine. Let us have a little bit of infill. Against that background, Â£600,000-worth of executive-style homes in a remote Wiltshire hamlet ain't what the Government should be encouraging. Other than that, I wholly endorse most of what the Government have said about their preference for brown-field sites. However, like most of my hon. Friends, I regret that the Government have been so timid in going for 60 per cent. They should have endorsed our target of 66 per cent. if possible. I have slight worries about how genuine the Government are being in their preference for brown-field sites. They give lip service in favour of these sites, but, at the same time, they allow building in Stevenage, West Sussex and Newcastle, and who knows where else. The decision to build 17,000 houses round Swindon will be an interesting touchstone for the Government's attitude towards new housing in country areas. It seems that the Government have the right ideas. The report says that they probably have the right ideas-vague but nevertheless the right ideas.

1998-10-22,Housing,197,Ann Cryer,Lab,False,"I thoroughly enjoyed the contribution by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Salford (Ms Blears). Many of her comments apply almost equally to my constituency although perhaps to a lesser degree. I welcome the Select Committee's report. The conclusions and recommendations are much in line with my own thinking. The statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the White Paper, which was produced earlier this year, are also to be welcomed, particularly the commitment to a 60 per cent. brown-field and 40 per cent. green-field future for housing land allocation. My anxiety is about how that policy is to be implemented. I am therefore pleased to note the recommendation in the Select Committee's report, which goes a long way to addressing the dilemma. I refer to the Select Committee's comment at the end of paragraph 245 on page xvii, which reads: "" We strongly agree with those witnesses who argued that there must be a restriction on the amount of greenfield land available for development if developers are ever to make full use of the brownfield land available."" I could not agree more. The Bradford unitary development plan, like others, makes far too much green-field land available. In a beautiful part of the Aire valley near Silsden in my constituency, it could allow 1,500 additional houses in green belt. The development would almost double the size of that mainly Victorian industrial village, remove for ever its character, urbanise yet further that green and pleasant part of our Aire valley, and leave schools, roads and other facilities unable to cope without massive injections of public money. The Silsden town action group, with support from me and the parish council, will oppose any detailed planning applications as they arise. I want to touch on two other green-field sites in my constituency's part of Bradford's UDP. Manor Garth, which has always been regarded as common land in Addingham in the Wharfe valley, was designated in the UDP as village green space. Unfortunately, the owners saw a sizeable profit coming their way if it was zoned for housing. They appealed, and the Department's inspector under the previous Government agreed that their land should be available for housing. In the teeth of opposition from the parish council, the civic society, the local authority and me, there is a strong possibility that eventually, this much cherished field, which allows views of some interesting ancient buildings, will be lost for ever. An almost identical situation prevails at Leeming, a hamlet close to the village of Oxenhope. Again, the landowner, on appeal to the inspector, was able to change a field from village green space to housing land and, at a stroke, enhance the potential size of his bank balance. I and Oxenhope village action group, the parish council and local councillors oppose any development on the site. The UDP review is starting to roll again. I hope that my constituents will take a much more careful and critical view of it than they and their councillors took four and a half years ago. I also hope that the next plan will be under the guidance of the Department, which will be implementing the recommendations of the Select Committee report. To show that all is not doom and gloom in my constituency on the planning and housing front, I shall mention a few minor triumphs. My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Housing visited us during the recess and saw two schemes funded by the single regeneration budget. The one in Keighley town centre is now complete, with family homes available at affordable rents. The other is at Oakworth road, where Hillworth lodge, the old and much detested workhouse, will be converted and enhanced to form a mixture of maisonettes and houses for older people and families. Plans to create a living-over-the-shop scheme of apartments in the town centre are being explored. I hope that they will eventually take shape. Those schemes will help regenerate and enhance Keighley town centre and the quality of life of those living there. Unlike the three green-field developments that I mentioned earlier, they are made up of homes that local people on low incomes will be able to afford. Many brown-field sites and unused buildings could be used for housing if there were incentives for developers to consider them instead of the rich pickings of green-field sites. Keighley has many former mills standing derelict, and there are the unused warehouses on the Leeds-Liverpool canal, which British Waterways is anxious to offload. Nearer the centre of Bradford, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Singh), lie the historic Lister's Manningham mills, where once the finest velvets were manufactured. The Victoria and Albert museum had thought of moving its south-east Asia collection there, which would have been welcomed by the local community, but, alas, that will not happen. What better way to use the building than to create hundreds of well-designed flats at affordable rents? Such a development has taken place at Saltaire in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) in the old mending and burling shed of Salts mill, alongside imaginative conversions of other parts of Salts to health authority offices, a Hockney art gallery and various attractive shops. It is a well-thought out conversion and use of what was becoming another derelict mill. There is so much that can be done to provide homes without losing vast areas of our countryside. Our Government are moving in the right direction. Where there is a political will, a practical way can usually be found. The report points us in the direction of that practical way. I congratulate the Committee on its thorough work and excellent ideas.",28292,[],Housing,0,39,housing,961
1998-10-22,Housing,198,Andrew Hunter,Con,False,"The Committee has produced a report and made recommendations that ontribute significantly to the housing debate, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss them. In Hampshire, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), and, perhaps, the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) know, we are facing a nightmare scenario. According to regional planning guidance, we are threatened with 56,000 houses. More than 25 per cent.-15,000-are destined for Basingstoke. Borough officials tell me that 76 per cent. of those must be built on green-field sites because of the lack of brown-field sites in the town of Basingstoke. There was an interesting variation of view between my hon. Friends the Members for Totnes (Mr. Steen) and for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray). I agree that 4.4 million may be the best estimate. I, too, have spent some time studying the various statistics that make up that estimate. I, too, find puzzling points which I shall tell the House about and ask my hon. Friends to contemplate. One is that in the period considered, there is a phenomenal anticipated increase in the number of European Union citizens working in the United Kingdom. The figure rises to 850,000, which means that we will have immigration not equalled even at the height of West Indian immigration in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the estimate does not take into account UK citizens who go to work in other EU countries. Another puzzling feature is the extraordinary slow-down assumed in the number of cohabiting non-married couples. We know from the census that in the 10 years before 1991, cohabiting unmarried couples increased from 2.9 to 6.4 per cent. of households, more than double, but for the 15 years covered by this estimate, the increase is only 0.3 per cent. It is very puzzling to think what social reason will lead to that extraordinary change. In those two respects, I believe that the estimate is likely to be suspect. There is common ground on at least one aspect in this debate: priority must given to brown-field site development and urban regeneration. I regret that the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) is not in his seat. He and I seldom agree. This time we do, and I regret that he is not at hand to share the moment. His evidence to the Committee was telling and was closely reflected in the speech by the hon. Member for Salford (Ms Blears). His testimony laid great emphasis on the urban dereliction in his constituency and he wrote of the imperative of creating penalties to deter green-field development and incentives to promote inner-city development. I take seriously the warning by my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire about green-field tax, but I believe that the Government should look positively on incentives to make inner cities habitable again. For that reason, I share the Committee's concern that Lord Rogers's task force should not be used as a means of causing delay. As the House-Builders Federation advocated in a helpful note that I received this morning, measures should be introduced long before we see Lord Rogers's report next year. I regret that to date the Government have gone for a rather miserly proposed target of 60 per cent. of development taking place on brown-field sites, to be achieved over 10 years. I welcome the Committee's recommendations that the target should be at least 60 per cent., and should be applied during the coming round of regional planning guidance rather than over 10 years. I noted with interest that the Committee said that there would be regional variations, and that in some regions brown-field development could be close to 100 per cent. but that in all regions it should be at least 40 per cent. If that became Government policy it would be good news for the people of north Hampshire. If borough officials are right in saying that brown-field sites to accommodate even 40 per cent. of the proposed development cannot be found, such a target would require either a significant lowering of the county's requirement for new housing, or a fundamental redistribution of new housing within the county. I suspect that even with that, 40 per cent. could not be achieved. The county council is right to urge the Government not to force the 56,000 houses on us but to look for a lower figure; 42,000, which is itself a considerable number, is the target it advocates. I share the Committee's conclusion that most new homes should be built in suitable urban areas, that brown-field sites or converted buildings should be used, and that the provision of green-field sites for development must be severely restricted. I shall throw out a word of caution about edge-of-town development. There are two dangers associated with it. West of Basingstoke there is an outline proposal to build 5,000 or so houses, and the provisional plans show an uneconomic use of land. It is imperative that if we go in for significant amounts of edge-of-town development, the land must be used economically. The example of Poundbury, with an accommodation density of 15 or 20 units per acre, shows that it is not necessary for excessive quantities of land to be used. That should be borne in mind when edge-of-town development is being considered. The second danger associated with edge-of-town development is that people may be encouraged to think that it will not generate traffic. That is not so, and it will not be so in the north of Hampshire, in the greater M4-Thames corridor. We have high employment, at least at the moment, and a highly skilled work force. High employment encourages job mobility, and people are prepared to drive 30 or even 50 miles to their places of work. If the current plans proceed, and about 15,000 houses are built around Basingstoke, it will be wrong to imagine that most of the people living in them will necessarily work in the town of Basingstoke. Traffic will be generated as they travel to their employment in various parts of the greater area. I welcome the fact that the report has raised these issues, and I hope that the Government will reflect the Committee's recommendations in their policy decisions. I also hope that their wider response on housing and planning will extend to reversing damaging decisions that have already been made and giving unqualified protection to the green belt, and that they will commit themselves to a target of at least 60 per cent. for brown-field development.",28292,[],Housing,0,40,housing,1084
1998-10-22,Housing,199,Graham Stringer,Lab,False,"I am grateful, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to have been called in this debate as well as in the previous debate on the future of the countryside. What characterised both debates, and the considerations of the Select Committee, was an increasing consensus among the political parties, the professionals giving evidence to the Committee, and even the Government in their response to the report, that the future protection of the countryside is intimately related to the protection of cities and towns. Urban renaissance depends on keeping the countryside as the countryside. My only quibble with my right hon. and hon. Friends in government is over the speed at which things should happen. I know the north-west better than the areas that Opposition Members have talked about, so I shall use it as my example. At a stroke-I hate using that phrase, because of its political pedigree-one could, by announcing that there would be no future housing developments on green-field sites, give Manchester, Liverpool and the other towns in the north-west the biggest boost imaginable. There is an alternative to an urban renaissance, and it is the urban dark ages. The future of our cities is on the cusp, on the edge, and immediate action is needed to make the developers who have invested their money in turnip fields and grass in the areas around our cities dedicate that money, and their creative resources, to the cities. Fields are bought up by the big housing developers as land banks for programmes that will go on for 30 years. While those resources are tied up in the countryside, the developers are not bringing their ingenuity and their contributions into the cities. Eventually, if they are allowed to concrete over the countryside, they will severely damage it. We want what people who watch American football call a "" hurry up"" offence. I associate myself with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Ms Blears). My constituency is in almost exactly the same socio-economic category as Salford, and I would like to deal in detail with the mechanisms that lead to the problems in the terraced streets. If we understand those mechanisms, some solutions can be applied fairly quickly. One of the housing facilities in my constituency is not voluntary; it is called Strangeways. It is possible for somebody to come out of Strangeways, collect his money and set up as a private landlord. He will buy a house in a terraced street and get somebody-preferably, from his point of view, an undesirable neighbour-to rent it. The landlord will get a capital return on the house within two or three years, sometimes less. If he puts his anti-social friends in, he can drive property prices down so that eventually nobody wants to live on either side of the whole of a terraced street. Such people can drive the prices of houses that cost Â£30,000 or Â£35,000 in the late 1980s down to Â£3,000 or Â£4,000. They then buy up the street. Nobody wants to live there, but housing benefit pays for the people who do live there. The local authority then has the problem of compulsorily purchasing the houses at values three or four years out of date. There must be a solution that stops public money being used to destroy parts of our inner cities. I do not believe that any other service comparable to the private rented sector is so completely deregulated. People can come out of prison and do what I have described. They are providing a service, and there is no recourse for tenants apart from the courts. We need a body like the one that oversees housing associations to regulate landlords and stop undesirables, as we do with publicans. To sell us a pint of beer somebody has to be of good character, but anybody can make people's lives miserable by becoming a private landlord. We need regulation and bodies for people to go to that will stop all that. I do not want to pretend that all private landlords are bad; they are not. However, there are some operating in my constituency and other constituencies in Manchester and Salford, such as Madina, who make real efforts to drive house prices down. Adjacent to terraced houses in my constituency-which are becoming increasingly difficult to let and which need Government action-there are council houses which are also difficult to let for similar reasons. Manchester city council is considering a proposal to knock down an estate where, only three or four years ago, families were living happily, and some families had been there for 22 years, since the estate was built. What happened? About three years ago, a group of drug dealers got on to the estate, and all who could move out did so. The local authority is considering demolishing the whole lot. I hope that it reconsiders. One of the reasons why the families moved out was that it took the local authority-which is good on these matters, and is better than many others-18 months to get the people out. There is no mandatory right for a local authority to get rid of the worst tenants, and we need a change in the law to provide that right. The proposals from the housing department in Manchester and from my colleagues when I was on the city council-to have provisional or probationary tenancies-have been unpopular in the housing world. We sponsored that idea for housing associations, and we want it for council tenants. I never thought that I would stand up in this Chamber to ask for less security of tenure for council house tenants. However, in estates in my constituency and most other inner-city constituencies one will find that tenants want the security of having the ability to evict those people who make their lives miserable, either by selling drugs or by other forms of anti-social behaviour. We need to change the rules; that will make a big and immediate difference in the city. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Salford and other hon. Members that cities are the future of this country. It will grow and thrive economically only if we make the cities work. If we neglect them, as we have done in the past, the whole economy and the whole of our society will fall into decline. We have to start, and there are things that we can do immediately. I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues will take action as soon as possible.",28292,[],Housing,0,41,housing,1082
1998-10-22,Housing,200,Howard Flight,Con,False,"I was privileged to serve on the Committee and I pay tribute to the Chairman, the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), and other colleagues with whom I worked. This is an important report which I hope receives better coverage in the media. The report is about an absolutely crucial subject to all of us and, as many have commented, the view reached was largely bipartisan. I do not think that this is fundamentally a party political issue. I wish to refer to some issues which, perhaps, were not greatly focused on in the report. The first is the rather crude macro-point that putting one third of all new housing and further economic concentration in the south-east is not acceptable in the long term. However, anyone who takes that view must accept that the market must be allowed to operate to some extent to make it more attractive for business to go elsewhere. Simply, if we restrict supply, house prices will rise, and that will have an economic impetus in terms of what companies do and where they locate. As the Committee Chairman pointed out, there is a lot of trying to have one's cake and eat it. Local authorities want economic development, but not the housing. The other side of that is that one must allow the market to operate if we are not to restrict supply. I am in the camp that is somewhat sceptical about the numbers. We are talking about a long time ahead to be predicting. The figures are trend-based, and who is to say that trends will stay the same? There are many other areas of activity where trends have changed dramatically. My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) referred to the growth in cohabiting and the assumptions of massive net immigration to this country. Some 80 per cent. of the growth is projected to be made up of single-person households. However, a recent important survey of young people showed that 84 per cent of 20-year-olds want to get married and have a normal family unit. If anything, they were reacting against some recent trends. The Government are laying down the figures too much-it is all slightly ""1984"". It is convenient for bureaucrats and developers to have plenty of scope-say, five years forward-to organise. I believe that supply is, to an extent, creating demand. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Salford (Ms Blears) made that point in referring to the destruction of the value and usage of perfectly good traditional terraced houses. I hope that we are not changing the buzz words from "" predict and provide"" to "" plan, manage and monitor"". I welcome the White Paper, but I have seen nothing that amounts to a fundamental change. We are still playing the old game of "" predict a number"" 20 years forward. We will need more flexible management of the numbers if we are to fine-tune the system. I had a long conversation with the executive of Redland who is responsible for the company's derelict land. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of urban land for redevelopment. The company wants to sell the land, but there is a planning nightmare because it is still a zone for industrial usage. Many authorities do not have their structural plans in place, and there is a five-year agony in trying to get planning permission. The system needs a bomb under it. There is masses of such land and there are willing sellers. However, many of the inefficiencies of the planning process stand in the way of getting the land used. In my constituency in West Sussex, we suffer from the green belt-it restricts building, as it were, in Surrey and tips it over the border into West Sussex. There is a pull-push between the two counties. One might suggest that, for larger cities in the south, the answer could be to extend the radius of the green belt from 35 miles to 80 miles. At present, we have had an explosion of far-distant dormitory rural suburbia-almost the worst possible result for the future. Architecture is terribly important, and Poundbury has been cited. The report was critical of new settlements, but if one goes to Bath, one cannot criticise a "" new settlement"" which was built 200 years ago. How is it that, 200 years later, we are not capable of building a beautiful, substantial new city? Surely we must be able to do that. Design and architecture matters should not completely rule out new settlements. In my part of the world, there is an extremely competent county council-both its civil servants and its political representatives-and I am extremely sceptical and concerned lest power move even further from the county councils and cities with which people identify to regional development agencies and Government regional offices. I do not believe that the Deputy Prime Minister really intended to approve those extra houses for West Sussex. I believe that the Government office for the south-east took the decision because it was concerned that it would set a dangerous precedent for other counties. I suspect that the Deputy Prime Minister may not have been fully aware of all the implications when he gave his approval. I make a plea to the Government to try to find a face-saving way of reviewing the decision. The Government know that the courts rejected the judicial review on a matter of law concerning the Government's power, not on whether it was a good decision. The report found six important territories contravening the decision. It rightly recommends that a detailed environmental sustainability appraisal should be at he centre of planning policy before starting. West Sussex has been a pioneer of that, as we know. One has to have proper consideration, consultation and examination in public to support the structural plan, with full cross-examination. West Sussex was the only authority to do that. The report calls on central Government to support local authorities and not to undermine them in restricting development on green-field sites. West Sussex has moved from 60 per cent. brown to 60 per cent. green, on the increase in the figures-an area that has already more than doubled its population in the past 25 years. Also, West Sussex has a huge water supply problem. In the summer, we have water rationing and water levels are sinking, with many lakes drying up. Long term, there is no evidence that we will have sufficient water. The report cites the bottom-up approach. As the Minister knows, 45,000 people in West Sussex have signed four or five petitions-people of all political parties. Is not that approach in line with getting the in-depth views of the community? Finally, on travel, what is known as the Cinderella line runs down to Arundel, and long may it so remain as it has preserved the southern half of West Sussex from being a commuter area. Only in the east of the area do we have such a travel facility. Let us forget the party politics. I ask the Government to find a discreet way to review the decision. We do not want pious words and good intentions. Let us really try to make it happen. The report highlights six key issues. As the Chairman of the Select Committee pointed out, there is an urgent need for intermediate Government guidance on the redemption of contaminated land. I happen to know of some land in Somerset that was banned because it was contaminated, even though the metal found was in fact from the Stone age. Another issue is the importance of getting a move on and implementing the 60 per cent. target now rather than over 10 years. Let us copy the French and get a move on to redefine conversions for value added tax. It cannot be that difficult. Let us also allow local authorities' structural plans to restrict migrants. Finally, there is no need to be in a hurry ahead of Lord Rogers' report. Those are the key issues on which we should get a move on, and they have cross-party support.",28292,[],Housing,0,42,housing,1349
1998-10-22,Housing,201,Vernon Coaker,Lab,False,"We are discussing one of the most crucial issues to confront Members of Parliament. I feel sorry for the Minister in some ways when I consider what we are trying to do. We have to regenerate our cities and stop the degeneration that is taking place. We must protect our green fields and countryside. However, at the same time we must meet housing need. Looked at in that way, it is a challenging task. Alongside that task, policies on transport, crime prevention, public service provision, the environment in general and employment must be developed. That is the nature of the task and without such associated policies the urban regeneration that we want simply will not take place. It cannot take place in a vacuum-the Select Committee Report, which is good, made that important point. The report builds on the guidelines in the Government's paper, "" Planning for the Communities of the Future"", recognising that new policies are necessary. The Government recently published their response to the Select Committee report, which demonstrates that they are not static, but are responding to the arguments with fresh thinking and a willingness to move forward. The new policies, when fully in place, will represent a truly radical change in planning-I think of that famous phrase, "" joined-up policies""-and will be a tribute to the Government. However, as the Minister knows, the transition from one set of planning policies to another is the problem and it is causing many of us to receive a significant number of letters in our post bags. The Minister knows Nottinghamshire well and I thank him for coming there to talk to local authorities and Members of Parliament about our problems. Our structure plan dates back to 1996 and was agreed according to the policies of the past. Having been allocated housing figures, the districts are busy identifying land to meet them. Gedling borough council is running a public consultation exercise to explain the process, but people in such areas as New Farm and Stockings Farm in Redhill are concerned that inappropriate development on green-field sites will take place despite the changed approach reflected in the Select Committee report and the Government's new policies. My constituents often tell me that they hear that policies have changed nationally, but that the change is not having the impact that they want locally. In fact, some of the old policies and guidelines are still being used, which makes little sense to them-or sometimes to me, either. The Minister has responded to such concern by telling Nottinghamshire local authorities that they can reallocate some of the housing between themselves if they can reach agreement; I thank him for doing so. However, it is difficult for them because the new policies are not in place. For example, Nottingham city council wants to build new houses, reclaim derelict land, convert offices and old factories to housing, use space above shops and so forth, as I am sure councils in Manchester, Glasgow and all our other cities wish to do. Under the existing financial regime, that is difficult. There must be changes in taxation so that we can regenerate Nottingham and our other cities and, at the same time, protect green-field sites where appropriate. Furthermore, in Nottinghamshire the changes that we need in taxation and grant policies have a bearing on some of the old coalfield and industrial areas. Without the changes, 4.4 million five-bedroom houses will be built to meet the need for 4.4 million households; and houses that would meet people's needs in city areas will not be built. The Select Committee report draws attention, at page 83-it is actually written in roman numerals and I had to look it up to ensure that I did not make an idiot of myself-paragraph 278 to the fact that the Department has always wanted to ensure "" that sufficient land is available at all times at the expense of so many of its other policies, for example on sustainable development, transport, the environment and the use of recycled land."" The Select Committee and the Government are saying that we need a phased release of land to ensure that an adequate amount of brown-field and, where appropriate, green-field land is available. Sequential planning is crucial to ensure that the brown-field sites are developed first and that developers do not take the easy option of using green-field sites-that is what they will do if we leave it to them. The central problem, particularly in Gedling and in Nottinghamshire in general, is speed, which is of the essence. While I understand the difficulties of moving from one set of policies to another, we are in the transitional phase and the old policies seem to be grinding on. Paragraph 270 of the Select Committee report states: "" There is no need to hurry into granting planning permission for greenfield development before Lord Rogers' Task Force has reported on the scope for using recycled land before PPG3 and PPG13 have been revised and before the implications of the Integrated Transport White Paper are taken into account."" All those matters are crucial if we are to meet our policy objectives. I know that the Minister is doing all he can and that he is aware of the problems. Our policies are changing and moving forward. As I said, we must ensure that all the joined-up policies are working together. In some ways, it does not matter who is in government-this is a difficult issue. However, we have a new Government bringing in new thinking and new policies to meet the challenge. If that challenge is met, our cities will be regenerated, our green-field sites will be protected, and there will have been a truly radical change on which the Government can look back with pride.",28292,[],Housing,0,43,housing,962
1998-10-22,Housing,202,Andrew Lansley,Con,False,"I do not want to rehearse what has been said, but I shall add one or two points. The report is extremely valuable and the debate is timely. The question is not so much the number of new homes-we have yet to find out how far future trends will be a reflection of the past-as what, in planning terms, a bottom-up approach means in practice. On the old predict-and-provide approach, there would be 71,000 additional commitments in Cambridgeshire, but only 25 to 30 per cent. of that number can be provided by using recycled land and windfall opportunities. If the minimum commitment is 40 per cent., we shall not, on the example of Cambridgeshire, be able to build 4.4 million new homes. On the bottom-up approach, South Cambridgeshire district council rightly responded to the draft regional planning guidance by undertaking an environmental capacity study, which considered those matters mentioned in the report-environmental sustainability, transport infrastructure, water resources and the infrastructure of public services. It makes little sense to propose, over the 20 years from 1995, a 40 per cent. increase in the number of new homes in a district that is already the fastest growing in the country. A bottom-up approach is not only about who makes the decisions, although that is important, but about the method by which one arrives at the numbers and decides where the new houses should be built. Even if there were nil growth in the area and no net migration, the affordable housing proposals would give rise to 13,000 extra commitments. If we constrain supply, we must find a more consistent way in which to sustain affordable housing so that local people are not driven out. What is the point of social housing if not to reinforce people's opportunities to stay in their familiar community structures? I am unhappy at the thought that the green belt should be pushed further out to prevent the creation of dormitory communities. In my area, the green belt exists not only to protect the rural villages outside Cambridge; it protects the city itself. If the green belt is pushed out as a result of new building on its inner edge, the historic city centre will be destroyed. The Committee's recommendation that we should focus on building in urban areas does not always apply. For example, Cambridge's historic characteristics would be destroyed if we were to allow urban sprawl or excessive urban density. We must consider other mechanisms, which will vary from place to place. In Cambridgeshire and parts of East Anglia, we may have to look constructively at the role of market towns. Where development is proposed, we shall have to consider the public transport options. I am concerned about the decision-making mechanisms, despite the Government's talk about decentralisation and taking decisions closer to the people. The draft regional planning guidance from the Standing Conference of East Anglian Local Authorities will be put forward for public examination in February-it will be the first such public examination. However, as we shall not have the new draft PPG3-the Minister will correct me if I am wrong-what is the point of the public examination? How can we know how the new tests are to be applied? I do not agree with everything in SCEALA's draft guidance, but it is better that such documents should be agreed by locally elected representatives than be comprehensively second-guessed by independent panels. We may know who is on the panel, but what is the rationale behind having a panel that overturns the decisions of locally elected representatives only to hand back its structure plan to the county council that did not subscribe to it in the first place? We must apply the bottom-up approach to ensure that local democracy generates the answers and that factors other than predict and provide are taken into account. We must take on board all the integral factors to find out how many new homes can be accommodated without destroying the environment of the area for which the planning was intended to provide a solution.",28292,[],Housing,0,44,housing,674
1998-10-22,Housing,203,Alan Whitehead,Lab,False,"I fail to recognise the green-crusader credentials of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns). I remember desperately attempting, as a local authority leader during most of the time in which the Conservatives were in government, to combat out-of-town shopping developments, only to find that the then Secretary of State for the Environment was giving out planning permission like confetti, with the results that we see today. I hope that the Conservative party has changed its tune, but I fear that, in the long term, it has not. I also failed to recognise Conservative Members' descriptions of the report as an attack on the Government. The report strongly supports much of what the Government are doing. Indeed, I was delighted at the Government's response, which endorsed and took further much of what the Committee said. The projection of 4.4 million extra households between 1991-2016 is robust. As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) confirmed, members of the Committee looked up to the figures-they may not be entirely accurate and there may have to be changes, but, essentially, we believe that they are robust. When the Government said that they wanted to end predict and provide, the response from some quarters was that the 4.4 million figure was no longer important and that people could do their own thing regardless of any overall effect on housing need. That response was misplaced. Our understanding of how the figures work has changed-for example, we know that windfall sites are much more important than was thought. Nevertheless, it is important that figures on future housing need retain some shape; if they do not, we shall all live to regret it. The 4.4 million houses should, ideally, be built on brown-field land-the Government's target is that 60 per cent. should be built on recycled land. In the early 1990s, 30 per cent. of completions on brown-field sites were outside urban areas, so we must be wary of the figures-brown field is not simply, as the Government know, an alternative to green field. We should add another dimension to the concept and specify that the brown field is urban-we should be looking at brown field sites in urban areas.

A local authority boundary does not determine what is urban. The real footprint of a city is often outside its local authority boundaries. Local authorities must collaborate in deciding how housing should be placed in urban areas. People cannot point to a city centre and say that that local authority should build all the houses. It needs collaboration between authorities and I regret that, in certain parts of the country, that collaboration on decision making does not seem to be present. On social housing, our report mentions our concern that there appears to be a considerable gap between likely provision and likely need. I am disappointed by the Government's response to the issue of social housing. We shall not be able to build new social housing by relying only on the private sector and private letting, or by relying on planning gain or local authorities overwhelmingly putting money into keeping their housing stock going-important though that is. We need more social housing to be built and we need an accurate understanding of the figures in order to understand how the Housing Corporation can be funded and how local authorities can respond. I know that the Government are currently reworking the research figures. I ask them to ensure that those figures are produced shortly so that we have an accurate fix on what we need for social housing. It needs to be dealt with urgently.

I believe that both sides of the House feel that the Committee has produced a comprehensive and interesting report with a number of thought-provoking ideas. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), I am extremely concerned about the implications for Hampshire of the dispute between the county's view, which proposes 42,000 houses as the requirement to meet the county's domestic need, and the belief of the unitary authorities in Portsmouth and Southampton that 56,000 houses, as proposed by the Government, are necessary to meet the needs of incomers as well as the county's domestic requirements. I understand that there is to be a meeting with the Secretary of State next week. I hope that he will be able to resolve the matter so that we can get on with it. It is clear that it would be much better for Hampshire if any proposed new planning policies could be introduced quickly. If they are not, the loss of green-field sites will continue and the resulting chaos will be regretted in the rural areas of Hampshire that are currently under threat. I hope that the Minister will take that on board. The report talks about the concept of environmental capacity. I understand that the Government are reasonably receptive to that concept, but there is no real guidance on what that means and how it can be applied. We have to consider whether we can regard an area as being full up. The hon. Member for Castle Point (Mrs. Butler) mentioned the pressures in her area. All of us in the south-east are subject to enormous pressure. There will come a time when we have to decide whether an area is full up. The recent experience of West Sussex is not very inspiring in that respect. The county council lost its judicial review in the High Court because the Secretary of State has discretionary powers. Although the county council had prepared an environmental capacity study, the Secretary of State said that it was flawed. How do we know that it was flawed? The county also claimed that further housing growth would seriously jeopardise its rural environment, and designated areas received much sympathy from the presiding judge. However, he held that the law was on the side of the Secretary of State and that he could do nothing to help. The county has had to appeal to the House of Lords. The time has come when we have to decide that an area is full and that its services and environment cannot take any further expansion. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) that this is a case where the market really can apply. If prices rise to a sufficient level, people will be forced to go elsewhere. That will be of benefit to other parts of the country, that are looking for economic and social development, which will not happen if we continue to concrete over the whole of the south-east and those areas that are currently under pressure. If that were to happen, the point made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Stringer)-he made some interesting comments about the inner cities-would be met as well. The inner cities would become much more attractive because the developers would not be able to place their money anywhere else and the cities would become somewhere to invest and make a useful return. That brings me to an important point that the Committee made in paragraph 246. It said that local authorities "" should also adopt a helpful and imaginative approach to proposals for urban developments, particularly in respect of their density, layout and the number of car parking spaces they require."" I endorse that strongly. Rushmoor borough council in Aldershot has done a tremendous job and put that into practice already. A big site by the railway station could have been used for a supermarket, but, instead, 200 flats and houses were built there. The number of car parks allocated for those units was half that applied elsewhere. That is one practical suggestion from the Committee that is being put into practice and which should be put into practice elsewhere in the country.",28292,[],Housing,0,48,housing,727
1998-10-22,Housing,207,David Drew,Lab,False,"Given the shortage of time, I shall be brief. I congratulate the Select Committee on taking on such a challenging topic and producing such a comprehensive report. Despite what the Opposition spokesman said, I believe that the Government produced a full response, which follows on from the White Paper by explaining how Government policy will take things forward. I want to talk about housing numbers. Some of us on the Labour Benches continue to challenge the numbers, but we realise that there are problems in so doing. We would like to see the Government's proposal for a six-stage scheme as an alternative to the trend-based forecast put into play as soon as possible. It gives an alternative a chance and gives people who want to see bottom-up planning some confidence that alternatives can be put in place. There are some people who believe that circular projections-the self-fulfilling prophesy that people will move into the houses that are being built-cannot be tracked nationally, but they can operate locally. I support the emphasis on a regional approach. We have not yet seen the competence of real regional emphasis. There will be a need to provide proper guidance and the proper level of support for that to operate effectively. The Select Committee report makes much of the difference of opinion between those who see the problem as being one of too much housing land and those who think that there is too little. That is simply due to a dysfunction in the provision of housing. We cannot pretend that there is much in common between the market for housing and the provision of affordable and, more particularly, social housing. We must face up to those problems. They are not two sides of the same problem. I now want to deal with phasing sequential planning and brown-field development. I urge the Government to be a little braver. Rather than saying that they are just looking at the ending of a five-year land supply, they should accept that there are considerable merits in protecting green-field sites and forcing the sequential principle forward. There is much that we can do to look at alternative places to build in rural Britain. The "" Planning and Affordable Housing"" document does not get much publicity, but I am pleased to see it. It ends the threshold, which means that in small village communities, social housing can be provided as part of the overall number of houses. We no longer have to have a minimum of 20 or 25 houses before insisting on a developer taking some interest. Economic measures are important. The proposal for a green-field levy is worth investigating and testing properly and I was interested to note that a report by the Civic Trust suggested that the concept had merit. As my hon. Friends have pointed out, hypothecation could allow urban regeneration and, at the same time, we could deal with council tax anomalies, not least of which is the second home problem. Although Members of Parliament gain from the current position, it has an appalling effect on many rural areas. We have had a good debate and the issues have been well aired. The report is timely and I commend the Government on their response to it.",28292,[],Housing,0,49,housing,541
1998-10-22,Housing,208,Laurence Robertson,Con,False,"It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who is my neighbour in Gloucestershire. I endorse his comments about predictions of the number of houses that will be required, because I also have doubts about them. Trends change, including the divorce rate, the number of people living alone, the age at which young people leave home and other factors affecting mobility, which makes the figure questionable to say the least. To address the need for houses is to ignore the need to protect the countryside. I am as aware as anybody of the need to provide homes for people, because, before I entered the House, I carried out a large project for the homeless. They were homeless not because they could not find homes to buy, but for other social reasons. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) said, if we continue to build at the current rate, the countryside will fill up. When that happens, will we then try to provide homes in a more sustainable manner? If so, why not address the problem now? The word "" sustainability"" is over-used and under-obeyed, but the Government should interpret it to mean providing for the needs of today's generation without prejudicing or compromising the needs of future generations. To protect future generations, we must take a radical approach now and not merely pay lip service to sustainability. Destroying the countryside-and creating increased traffic and social problems-while ignoring the needs of inner cities and town centres, is not sustainable. The pressure to build more and more houses causes many problems in Tewkesbury, which has been forced to accommodate far more than its fair share of housing recently. That has led to the destruction of several attractive villages. Part of the reason is the difficulty that some districts have in providing brown-field sites. Pressure to build in Tewkesbury has led to land that had been declared unsuitable being reconsidered. For example, people's allotments and green-field sites have been built on, and other land, which if built on would lead to villages coalescing, is now being considered for the same fate. I endorse the comments made by the Council for the Protection of Rural England that the local environment must be taken into account when building in rural areas. Sustainability means developing brown-field sites and derelict sites and empty and old buildings, not destroying the countryside and ruining lives. I do not wish to be party political, but I believe that the Government's policy is inadequate. The Government adopted the previous Government's projected figure, but they did not need to do so. The Government have set up regional agencies without giving them the full responsibility to protect the environment and have also set a worryingly low target for building on brown-field sites. Regardless of party politics, the planning of the building of new houses needs a radical rethink if it is to be sustainable.",28292,[],Housing,0,50,housing,489
1998-10-22,Housing,209,Richard Caborn,Lab,False,"I congratulate members of the Select Committee on their useful and timely report. I am delighted that the Government are able to agree with many of the Committee's conclusions; that is reflected in our response to the report. I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), the Chairman of the Committee. As the former Chairman of the Trade and Industry Committee, I know how difficult it can be to obtain unanimity-I say that from experience and with some bruises-but only unanimous reports carry real weight. This report is unanimous, and must be taken seriously. The underlying message from the Committee is clear: we must face the fact that people must have an opportunity to live in decent homes. Not before time, we have a growing cross-party consensus on how to plan future house building in a sustainable way that drives the urban renaissance agenda. A clear consensus on that has emerged tonight. It is not a matter of green-field versus brown-field sites, urban versus rural or country versus town. The Government's response makes it clear that we must rise above NIMBYism, although some hon. Members have tried to draw the drawbridge up tonight to protect their villages. The contribution by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) for the official Opposition did not show much consensus, and there were a couple of other exceptions, but I hope that we can take the political opportunity to stop urban decay and the urban flight.

1998-10-22,Housing,211,Richard Caborn,Lab,False,"No, I mean the urban flight to rural areas. The hon. Gentleman should think about the situation. The Government accept the key recommendation by the Select Committee, that we should publish an urban White Paper. We share the view that, by revitalising and regenerating our towns and cities, and creating an urban renaissance, we will take the pressure off the countryside and bridge the housing gap between the haves and the have-nots. The household projection figures have been one of the main topics of discussion tonight. The Committee last looked at the issue in 1995-96, when it broadly accepted the methodology, and I welcome the fact that the confidence in it has been reaffirmed. I hope that we can put to bed for good the fruitless arguments about the figures. The Government have tried to be as helpful as possible about the next set of projections. The Committee recommended that "" the Government publish with the next national household projections an analysis which shows the effect of small changes in the assumptions underlying the projections."" In response, the Government state: "" The Department notes the recommendation and will publish suitable sensitivity analyses alongside the next set of household projections."" It is in everybody's interest to ensure that the figures are understood, and the analysis accepted. I welcome the Committee's support for our national land recycling target of 60 per cent. I do not know where some hon. Members have been for the past 18 years, but if we hit 60 per cent., it will be 10 per cent. better than the Conservatives did in their 18 years. The Opposition Front-Bench spokesman has attacked us, although we have been in government for 18 months, but the analysis of brown-field utilisation that we shall publish in a few days' time will prove acceptable. We accept that there is more to be done. We intend that the regions should establish their own targets through regional planning guidance. I expect them to engage in that process with some urgency. I agree with much of what has been said. That problem will be resolved not in Whitehall, but in the regions and local towns. The Government are trying to introduce innovatory ideas. The millennium village is on a contaminated site at Greenwich, and my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction tells me that that site received an award last night for the decontamination work done there. We are looking into the problems left at Allerton Bywater by the rundown of the mining industry. We are trying to increase the size of that village to give it some economy of scale. We want to resolve the problem without people having to move out. We are trying, in innovative ways, to bring brown fields back into use and to introduce better planning. We will genuinely try to hit the 60 per cent. target. I welcome the Committee's support for our approach to the provision of regional housing. The regional planning conferences have an essential role to play. We intend to set out a timetable for production of regional planning guidance, and we expect the regions to stick to it and to produce responsible and realistic plans for accommodating housing requirements in their areas. There must be certainty. Everyone says that certainty is needed in the planning regime. Central to that certainty will be having everyone in the planning system adhering to the timetables that we shall evolve after consultation with the parties involved. We are keen to maintain momentum towards decentralisation of power. As the Committee's report stresses, power comes with responsibility. We genuinely want to devolve powers to the regions so that we can have a bottom-up process. The same is true of local plans. We must respond to the challenges to the Government and to society. Let me turn to the way forward. Our policy statement last February made it clear that our first choice for new development is that it should be on previously developed land, preferably in urban areas. That sequential approach is long overdue, and we want authorities to explore options fully before they propose urban extensions or the release of other green-field sites. That will be covered more extensively by the revised PPG3. The Select Committee rightly posed more detailed questions about how we will deliver. Let me fill in some of the gaps. As our response to the Committee makes clear, we have embarked already on an extensive programme of policy initiatives, as set out in "" Planning for the Communities of the Future"" and "" Modernising Planning"". The urban task force, under the guidance of Lord Rogers, is examining the difficulties of redeveloping our urban areas, which have been graphically described, particularly from my side of the House. The task force contains a broad range of expertise drawn from all the professions involved in the debate, from developers to environmentalists. We look forward to receiving Lord Rogers's report in the first half of next year, but he has made it clear this week that he will produce an interim report at the turn of the year. Work on compiling the national land use database-the equivalent of a Domesday register for the 21st century-is already well under way. The initial results are due next March. It is gathering on-line data about every previously developed site in the country, and I assure the House that that is no mean feat. We will soon know how many previously developed sites there are, and we shall be able to keep that information up to date. Rather than speculate about the ability to reuse brown-field land, we shall shortly have factual information to inform our land recycling policy. We have a full programme of revision for planning policy guidance. Our response to the Select Committee refers a number of times to the updating of the guidance note on housing, known as PPG3. We are grateful for the Committee's proposals on that document, and we shall factor them into our considerations. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) will be the first to have a public examination. I intend to produce PPG3 before that, hopefully by the turn of the year. I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman will appear at the public examination, and I will ensure that he has the revised PPG3 in his hands. We are working on other planning guidance, such as the notes on transport, spatial planning and regional planning. We are also working on issues such as compulsory purchase and the use of economic instruments. We need a comprehensive approach, so that we can answer serious structural weaknesses in this part of society. It has been made clear this evening that we need an holistic approach to urban housing policy. The problems will not be solved through the planning process alone. I am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister was able to announce on Tuesday that the Government have accepted the Select Committee's recommendation to publish an urban White Paper. We expect to do so next year. It is 20 years since there was an urban White Paper. My right hon. Friend remembers it well, because he was parliamentary private secretary to the then Secretary of State, Peter Shore-now Lord Shore-and he was deeply involved in that paper. Regrettably, the Conservative Governments of the 1980s and 1990s failed to advance many of the ideas that flowed from the White Paper. Debates on Select Committee reports must be kept above party politics, but we have heard a little hypocrisy in the debate. Lord Tebbit used to say, "" Get on your bike, come to the south-east and go to where the jobs are."" People came, but now the Conservatives complain because we have to house them. Lord Tebbit has not spoken tonight, but he spoke volumes years ago, and we are grappling with the problems he left us. The overheating of the south-east arises from the type of economic policies pursued by previous Administrations. The Labour Government have a new vision for a new set of urban issues. We seek thriving communities that provide jobs and provide homes that are attractive and pleasant to live in. We are determined to drive an urban renaissance. We are determined to turn our cities back into places where people want to work, live and play. The urban White Paper will link key strands of Government vision for an urban renaissance. It will embrace our programmes for education, employment, health, housing, the problem of social exclusion and transport. It will be the most comprehensive and far-sighted programme of urban renewal since our last White Paper in the 1970s. It has always been Labour Governments who have addressed the real problems of land use planning. It is 50 years since a Labour Government put the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 on to the statute book. It was a Labour Government who introduced the national parks. It was a Labour Government who introduced the green belt. All that the previous Administration did was to take concrete mixers to build out-of-town shopping centres, and allow more development on green belt and green-field sites than any other Administration ever allowed.

2001-11-15,Housing,413,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"I welcome the opportunity to spell out the Government's vision for housing. The number of people present shows how much interest there is in the subject, and suggests a level of commitment to improving housing standards. Housing is a basic human requirement that has, perhaps, a greater impact on quality of life than anything else, influencing our health, educational achievements and even employment prospects. Housing is at the top of the Government's agenda; we are deeply committed to improving standards in the social and private sectors, and have already done much to deliver those improvements. However, far too many people still live in poor conditions or overcrowded housing; too many families spend months in bed-and-breakfast accommodation and too many homes are left empty and abandoned in areas of low demand. That is unacceptable, which is why we have set ourselves the objective of offering everyone the opportunity of a decent home. Last December, we published the housing policy statement "" The Way Forward for Housing"", which sets out our strategy. I want to focus on the measures that we are taking to deliver our key priorities, although it will be possible to touch only briefly on the issues of improving the quality of housing stock, tackling homelessness, providing more affordable housing, fighting problems of low demand and abandonment and bringing about a culture change in the delivery of housing services. First, let me address the problem of improving the quality of housing stock. In a modern society such as ours, no household should have to live in less-than-decent housing, which is why we set a target to bring all social housing up to a decent standard by 2010. That is a challenging target, but we must and will deliver on it. We have significantly increased resources for housing to meet the target. with an extra Â£1.8 billion from 2001-02 to 2003-04 in addition to the extra Â£5 billion made available through the 1998 spending review and capital receipts initiative. However, delivering the target will require not only extra resources but a partnership between the Government and social housing providers, who are key to improving the standard of stock.",36705,[],Housing,0,1,housing,358

2001-11-15,Housing,417,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, although I cannot accept it. Some of the worst conditions that I have seen since becoming a Minister have been in London. People's reasons for leaving their homes sometimes have nothing to do with the quality of their homes, but are to do with the quality of the environment. The Government are taking other measures to deal with that. In terms of the quality of the stock, we are offering social landlords a range of alternative investment and ownership options, such as the new arm's-length management arrangements and the private finance initiative for housing, to help to improve both the quality and diversity of social housing. The transfer of housing from local authorities to registered social landlords remains one of the key routes to delivering decent homes.",36705,[],Housing,0,5,housing,138
2001-11-15,Housing,418,David Drew,Lab,False,"The Minister is being characteristically generous with interventions, given the number of people who wish to speak today. My area faces a dilemma. The local authority, Stroud district council, has a well-run local housing authority, and I have always opposed externalisation of the stock. The authority is faced with the double whammy of increasing sales through the right-to-buy scheme and a corresponding reduction in central Government grant. It is being driven to consider the idea of the community gateway. Is that what the Government want, or is there an alternative?",36705,[],Housing,0,6,housing,90
2001-11-15,Housing,419,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"I am grateful for that point. The central Government grant is being reduced because of loss of stock. The reduction should reflect the reduction in the number of units, and it is not possible to continue to pay the same level of grant if the authority has a reduced amount of stock. It is appropriate for some councils to consider stock transfer as an option. Such councils must consider it with their tenants and, ultimately, the tenants will make the decisions. However, there is a range of issues relating to improvements to the fabric of the stock and the management structure. I shall try to make progress, otherwise my speech will eat into other Members' speaking time. Stock transfer can bring much needed improvements to tenants' homes. It can also play an important part in securing regeneration-it has been particularly effective in areas of low demand. If tenants support proposals for this year's transfer programme, more than 300,000 dwellings could be transferred over the next two years, yielding more than Â£1.1 billion in capital receipts for authorities. Of course, we must not ignore poor conditions in the private sector, which is where some of the worst stock is to be found. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that squalid conditions are not condoned simply because they are in the private sector. Some of our biggest commitments to future legislation on housing are therefore aimed at tackling problems in the private sector. That includes licensing of houses in multiple occupation and selective licensing of landlords in areas of low demand. I shall return to that issue later. Whether to intervene in the private sector is for local authorities to consider as part of their strategic responsibility for housing across all tenures. That is why we plan to give them greater freedom over how they tackle poor-quality private housing. We shall propose secondary legislation to achieve that by Christmas. But it is not just the physical condition of housing that is important; the living environment is important, too. The current overcrowding standards have remained unchanged since 1935. Our understanding of people's need for space and privacy has come a long way since then, and we are reviewing the options for updating them. I am well aware of the problems faced by many people, particularly in London and the south-east, in securing good-quality, affordable housing. We have significantly increased funding for new affordable housing-almost doubling funding for the Housing Corporation over the three years to 2003-04. That will help to deliver our target of providing 100,000 new affordable homes by the end of 2004.",36705,[],Housing,0,7,housing,432
2001-11-15,Housing,420,Jeremy Corbyn,Lab,False,"I am pleased that the Minister is talking about expanding the number of affordable rented homes. Will she say more about the difficulties faced by local authorities and the near impossibility of building new council homes in London? That is due to the need for capital repairs on existing properties and the impossibility, so far, of borrowing against existing stock to finance new developments.",36705,[],Housing,0,8,housing,64
2001-11-15,Housing,421,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"The provision of new social housing for rent has been procured through the Housing Corporation. Affordable housing has also been provided through partnership arrangements with the private sector. That approach will enable us to achieve our target of 100,000 new units over the period in question. It is not only those on the lowest incomes who have difficulty in securing affordable accommodation, particularly in London and the south-east. Public sector workers are among those who struggle to secure homes near their place of work, and that can have a devastating impact on the provision of local services. It also has implications for the need to regenerate very disadvantaged areas in inner London. The starter home initiative makes an important contribution to meeting the housing needs of some 10,000 key workers, and the bulk of the investment from that programme is being put into London. We must consider other ways of increasing the supply of affordable housing, while also aiming to develop more mixed and sustainable communities. There is no doubt that a concentration of one type of housing or tenure can lead to problems, whether in the monolithic social housing estates of London or in the rows of pre-1919 terraces that are now so unpopular in parts of the north. We are therefore encouraging local authorities to make the best use of the planning system to secure more affordable homes as part of mixed developments. We must also ensure that we make the best use of existing stock. Bringing empty properties back into use is an important contribution to increasing the overall supply of housing. Some parts of the country suffer the opposite problem, because properties are in low demand or, in extreme cases, abandoned. Hon. Members whose constituencies suffer similar problems will be all too aware of the misery of home owners whose homes have fallen drastically in value and who are trapped alongside rows of boarded-up and empty properties. There are no easy answers to that problem. The causes and consequences of low demand vary from area to area. Sometimes there is a link to crime and disorder and sometimes the need for more jobs is a major factor. For some areas, we are contemplating wholesale regeneration at a cost of tens of millions of pounds. For others that risk tipping over the edge into total market collapse, we need to take more immediate action-sharp intervention when decline starts.",36705,[],Housing,0,9,housing,401

2001-11-15,Housing,423,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"The factors that the hon. Gentleman has identified do not match up. Problems in lower demand areas are focused far more on large swathes of single tenure housing, all of one type, where the market completely collapses. Other housing attracting people away is not the issue. There is no way to get people into certain types of housing. The activity of private sector landlords is also relevant-I shall discuss that issue shortly-and control of those would be a major factor in dealing with some of the problems of low demand, particularly in the north of England. We need to develop a better understanding of the scale and dynamics of the problem if we are to carry out the Government's commitment to turn it around by 2010. Some hon. Members may be aware of work done by Birmingham university on the subject. Its report has many lessons for all of us who are concerned about the quality and quantity of the housing stock. The private sector renewal reforms that I mentioned earlier, and our recent proposals for licensing the private rented sector in low-demand areas, will go some way to giving authorities the tools and freedoms they need to respond to local circumstances and develop strategies for lasting change. I have already mentioned the need to diversify the housing stock. It is clear that some stock-for example, some of the terraces that I mentioned-is obsolete. Local authorities must face some difficult decisions about the future of their stock if they are to ensure a supply of housing better suited to modern needs and aspirations. Indeed, local authorities are key to the delivery of the Government's objectives for housing. That is why we are encouraging them to develop their strategic role and to work in partnership with other services, such as planning and regeneration, and with local stakeholders, including housing associations, tenants and the private sector. That is vital, not just to tackle market problems, but to ensure that they meet the needs of all local people and offer them a real choice about the type of housing and community that they have. Choice is an important part of the Government's housing policy. By offering social tenants choice as to where they live, we give them a greater interest in their homes and a stake in their community. We are funding a number of pilot schemes to test out new approaches to letting social housing that treat tenants as customers rather than as people in receipt of a handout. The new choice-based approach is already up and running in a number of the pilot areas, and the pilot authorities are reporting a positive response from their local communities.",36705,[],Housing,0,11,housing,446

The point of the choice-based lettings approach is to ensure that people still have some say about where they live, even in areas of very high demand. It is fundamental for local authorities and others to adopt that change of culture in their treatment of, and approach to, tenants and people in their local communities.",36705,[],Housing,0,13,housing,80
2001-11-15,Housing,426,David Drew,Lab,False,Does my hon. Friend accept that rural areas present a particular problem because the planning system's inability to deliver affordable housing means that people who wish to live in such areas have no choice?,36705,[],Housing,0,14,housing,34
2001-11-15,Housing,427,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"Of course it is harder in some areas than in others. Some local authorities, in both rural areas and big cities, have been very creative in their use of the planning system to provide affordable housing. Whatever the circumstances, it is important that local authorities and others provide people with as much choice as possible over where they live. In the areas that run choice-based schemes, it is interesting to see the displays of photographs and property details that give people who are waiting for housing the opportunity to match the types of places on offer with their requirements and wishes. There is, of course, still assessment of need, but people are not forced to live in properties where they really do not want to live. That is an important principle. It is also part of our drive to develop more customer-focused housing services that respond better to people's needs. I have highlighted our priorities and just some of the measures that we are introducing to address them. Clearly, those are not the only challenges that we face. Tackling the rising number who find themselves homeless each year is a key priority for the Government. My Department has recently consulted on proposals for a national strategic framework to set the broad context within which local authorities will prepare their homelessness reviews and strategies. It will also set the context for the requirements of the Homelessness Bill currently going through Parliament. That Bill places a new duty on local authorities to undertake a review of homelessness in their areas and to develop a multi-agency strategy to tackle homelessness, with the emphasis on prevention. It also brings more people into the category of those regarded as homeless with a priority need for housing. The response to homelessness has increasingly been to put families into unsuitable temporary accommodation, especially bed-and-breakfast hotels. That is unacceptable. We have established a new bed-and-breakfast unit to work with authorities to see what more can be done to reduce the use of such accommodation.",36705,[],Housing,0,15,housing,336

It will identify the various people placed in bed-and-breakfast units, the types of problem that they face and how best to reduce them. It will pay particular attention to families in such accommodation, as the pressures that they suffer are the worst. Finally, we must provide better quality and more appropriate housing for vulnerable groups. It will be important to separate the strategic and provider functions of local authorities, so that they can identify the vulnerable groups that require different types of housing and ensure that that housing is provided. The key to that provision will be our "" supporting people"" programme, which will make a huge difference to meeting the needs of vulnerable people when it comes into operation in 2003. Support services can help stabilise vulnerable people, help them move out of institutions or prevent them from having to move into residential care.",36705,[],Housing,0,17,housing,173

I am confident about the provisions now in place, but we need to ensure that people are placed in the community where they can be monitored and that the proper precautions are in place. It is a hard balance to strike, but I am confident that, with the increased provision made by the Government, the public and especially children are better protected. The "" supporting people"" programme will be important in providing the sort of housing that is needed for ex-offenders, as well as for other groups who often fall through the safety net of current housing and social service provision. The programme will also provide instant support when people hit a crisis, which might be due to homelessness or the need to flee domestic violence. It is about developing better, more flexible support services. Crucially, the new arrangements will increase quality and help local authorities to deliver the support that people want and need. It is a challenging programme and it will be difficult to put in place exactly the right services from day one. However, it will probably prove to be the most important development in securing the support, encouragement and welfare services that those who have slipped through existing safety nets need. I have set out the Government's challenging agenda and touched on some of the controversial issues, and I am entirely confident that hon. Members will touch on many more. However difficult some issues might seem, it is vital that we face up to them and find ways through. Housing is fundamental to people's quality of life.

We will support the Government in that, and I hope that they do indeed deliver on that important pledge. We must all hope that the housing market remains stable in what may prove a declining economy. Given the current interest rate, the housing market is very different from that of previous economic recessions. None of us wants a repeat of previous dips in the housing market, because they make it much more difficult to build new houses in the private and social sectors. Before the 1997 election, the Prime Minister promised everyone the chance of a decent home, but in reality he has made getting a foot on the property ladder more difficult. The average cost of a first-time buyer's home has risen by 23 per cent. since the Government came to power. In London, the average first-time buyer needs to find an extra Â£40,000.

2001-11-15,Housing,441,Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,Con,False,"It is thoroughly good that interest rates are as low as in 1955, when a Conservative Government were in power. It will also be good if those rates encourage more people to buy their own homes, something that our party wants to see. Unfortunately, according to the Government's figures, the amount of social housing constructed under them has plummeted. From 1993 to 1996, local authorities and registered social landlords built 150,000 new social dwellings, but from 1996 to 2000, only 95,500 such units were constructed. That amounts to a 37 per cent. drop. One of the biggest issues that we can address today, and I say this in a spirit of non-partisanship- The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) may laugh, but if he waits to hear what I have to say, he might agree with it. One of the most significant factors in the housing sector are the 763,900 empty houses-the Minister gave me that total in an answer on 12 November. Yet we know-she gave me this figure as well-that, in the first six months of 2001, there were 59,530 homeless people. We should try to redress the balance, because every homeless person is a human tragedy. If Labour Members think that that is funny, they can ask homeless people about it.

Gentleman is very good at intervening because I have seen him many times in the Chamber, but if he can contain himself a little longer, I will let him intervene later, although I know that he is mischief making. I return to the subject of empty property. Under this Government, the amount of empty council housing in England has risen by 7 per cent., from 81,200 in April 1997 to 87,186 in April 2000. We are concerned not only about the total numbers of dwellings, the figures for which I have supplied, but about the number of empty council houses, which is rising. That is unacceptable and I believe that the ombudsman had something to say about it. On the subject of the homelessness strategy, the Minister knows that we welcomed the Homelessness Bill, which we believe will play a major part in dealing with this tragic problem. However, that Bill arrives amid a host of Government initiatives. We do not know what the Government's homelessness strategy will be, nor do we yet have guidelines on vulnerable groups, which are being published. I raised that with the Minister during the homelessness debate and have done so since. Many people outside this place are anxious to see the guidelines to which my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) referred. They deal with critical groups: 16 to 18-year-olds who are being abused; 18 to 20-year-olds; and those who have left institutions.

The Bill includes policies for priority groups, but we have yet to see them or the proposals for rogue landlords in the private sector. The bed-and-breakfast unit is also a problem, as the hon. Member for Edmonton said. I probed the Minister on that in a written question, and she answered on 9 November with some shocking figures. She told me that in the first quarter of 1997, 4,100 were in bed and breakfast, whereas in the first quarter of 2001, a staggering 10,830 were. According to my maths, that is an increase of over 150 per cent., which suggests that this is the sharp end of the homelessness problem. It is incumbent upon us all to consider that problem carefully, and I hope that the Minister and her Department will be in constant touch with the bed-and-breakfast unit to watch progress. The Minister told me that the unit would host a conference on 20 November to consult on targets and actions for reducing bed-and-breakfast units, but I hope that it will concentrate on actions rather than targets. I also asked her about the conditions in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, much of which-particularly in London, but also in other big cities-is pretty grim. It might be marginally better than sleeping rough on the street, but only just. We must ensure that there are common standards. Housing benefit is a great difficulty for those at the lower end of the income scale and for those who have to administer it, and I am highly critical of the Government on that. Since Labour came to power in 1997, more than 100 changes have been made to the housing benefit regulations.

The failure of IT Net in my borough has been repeated in borough after borough across the country. Does the hon.

However, councils such as my local authority were allowed to continue to administer housing benefit if they could prove that their costs were lower than in the private sector. That is not to say that I do not sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's position, but the remedy is in his and the Government's hands. If the job is not being done properly in the private sector-nobody would condone that-it should return to local authority administration. In view of this serious problem, a Conservative Government would consider whether housing benefit should be taken from local authority control and handed to the Benefits Agency to be administered with other benefits.

Even in my local authority, such situations have occurred, which is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. I should like to move on because time is short and hon. Members want to raise other matters. I should like to raise the important issue of key workers. We all know that the housing market has put the price of houses at the bottom end of the scale out of the reach of many key workers in the public sector. That is a problem in London, the south-east and in my area, the Cotswolds. We must carefully consider schemes for key workers-not only those who are currently listed, but others who need to be included. In my constituency, the Fosseway housing association is undertaking an experiment with a key workers scheme in Swindon, and I hope shortly to have the results. I recently heard about a local post for a maths teacher for which nobody applied.

I want to ask the Minister about the original Homes Bill. Do the Government intend to revive the proposals for seller's packs, contained in part I, or are they finally dead? I recently attended a meeting with the Council of Mortgage Lenders, where I was strongly lobbied to the effect that such added bureaucracy was not needed in the present precarious housing market, and that the advent of new technology such as e-conveyancing and e-local authority searches would eventually overtake the need for it.

The Minister gave an astonishing answer: "" This Department has carried out no research recently on the causes of homelessness in relation to violence in the home or drug abuse.""- That is an extraordinary state of affairs, especially given that Crisis tells us that those suffering from drug abuse are one of the most difficult groups to deal with.

The debate has been important, particularly in relation to homelessness and the most vulnerable in our society.

The Minister faces many challenges, and she expects to hear us recount some of them this afternoon. Personally, I would place the provision of an adequate supply of affordable housing at the top of my "" to do"" list. Nevertheless, I shall not assail the Minister with problems; most of my speech will be brimful of unremittingly good news, as I am sure she will be pleased to hear. I would like to start with the Government's changes to planning policy. The changes to planning policy guidance No. 3-PPG3-are intended to help local authorities to use planning law to secure the provision of more affordable local housing. In some parts of the country, that is working tolerably well. I saw a good local example at a recent parish council meeting where the councillors were poring over a set of plans for a new housing development of 120 units. About a quarter of the units were affordable housing. In some parts of the country the strategy is working well, but in others it is not. Last week, other hon. Members and I went to the launch of a report jointly produced by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Housing Corporation, called "" Delivering Affordable Housing through the Planning System"". I accept that the report will never be a best seller, but it makes a number of practical recommendations to help standardise the successes of PPG3 across the country. I shall not read the whole list, but it includes, for example, a recommendation that local authorities should have clearly based policies for achieving planning-led affordable housing, and that their policies should be underpinned by robust research and data. It also recommends that they select more specific targets for the amount, nature and timing of affordable housing. The Government do not escape. The report recommends that they set up an industry standard for an approach to affordable housing demand forecasting, and that they promote model clauses for documents such as section 106 agreements. The report does not stop there. It also makes recommendations for developers and registered social landlords. Members who have not yet read the report should do so. The Minister had a representative in the audience for the launch, and I hope that she has examined the report and is willing to make use of it to review Government guidance and promote more consistency nationally.

2001-11-15,Housing,474,David Kidney,Lab,False,"Let me move on to the subject of empty homes. As the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) pointed out, it is not necessarily a good news story. More than 750,000 properties still stand empty, and six out of every seven are in the private sector. It is important that people in the private sector accept their responsibility to help to reduce the number. It would have been better news if the Minister had accepted my amendment to the Homelessness Bill, which would have required local authorities to set targets for reducing the number of empty homes. Nevertheless, there is some good news. The Government recently reduced VAT for some parts of the sector in order to regenerate empty properties. Members are welcome to sign early-day motions to urge the Government to make further VAT reductions and to reduce and eventually end the 50 per cent. council tax discount for long-term empty homes, if not universally at least in some circumstances. I would welcome that; it was one feature of the Empty Homes Bill that I introduced in the previous Parliament. I urge the Minister to go further and to amend the Homelessness Bill to provide guidance to local authorities on their duty to act strategically to reduce the number of empty houses.

2001-11-15,Housing,476,David Kidney,Lab,False,"I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I commend the Empty Homes Agency, which promotes co-operative work of that sort between local authorities and the private sector throughout the country. In some areas, the local authority or the private sector do not listen, but I shall mention in a moment an example in my area of the local authority and the private sector working well together. It is not good news that the Government have not yet met their 1997 manifesto commitment to legislate to ensure the registration of housing in multiple occupation? We shall have an early opportunity to put that right with a private Member's Bill, the Home Energy Conservation Bill, which would provide a registration scheme. I should be interested to hear from the Minister whether the Government will support it. I came under a lot of pressure about the registration of houses in multiple occupation when I attended a Folgate residents' association meeting in Stafford a couple of years ago. It is an old estate, with narrow streets and large, terraced houses with no gardens. Many of the houses had been purchased by developers, who converted them into bed-sit accommodation. There was much social conflict between the long-stay residents-families who have more than one car-and the newcomers. They would certainly have welcomed a system for registering houses in multiple occupation because they were worried about social conflict and the safety of the property for its given use, especially as the properties were packed so closely together. I have received representations from the student union of Staffordshire university. Stafford is fast becoming a university town, and many students occupy property in the private sector. On behalf of those students, the union is keen for acceptable standards to prevail. I can give an example of good local co-operative working in Stafford, where there is a robust three-way partnership between the university accommodation office, Stafford borough council and the private landlords. Between them, they agree minimum standards for the properties that the students will occupy, and the private landlords allow environmental health officers to inspect to ensure that standards are maintained. That shows a marvellous commitment on both sides. Meanwhile the accommodation office solves problems that arise between private sector landlords and their student tenants. The three groups work well together. As an offshoot, the borough council and private landlords work well in a forum and have developed a rent guarantee scheme. I would not anticipate much local objection to a statutory registration scheme for houses in multiple occupation, given the level of co-operation in the sector. Anti-social behaviour affects issues wider than housing. The Government introduced an ability for councils and police to apply for anti-social behaviour orders as a quick way of stepping in when problems occur, but that has not happened often in my constituency. The council would rather the police spent their money and the police would rather the council spent its money, so neither has done anything. In Stafford, some of the registered social landlords are a little impatient that neither the council nor the police will help them. They want the power to apply for anti-social behaviour orders themselves. They say, "" In many parts of the country we and not the local council are the big housing providers. Why should the council have preferential treatment in being allowed to apply for orders when we may not?"" It is interesting that they should be willing to take that on. I can cite another development in Stafford. A bunch of enterprising women set up a company called ASBO, which offers a service to local authorities and police to tackle the problems of anti-social behaviour. The company offers a complete service, including gathering evidence of sufficient quality, relevance and rigour to satisfy legal requirements, and winning the active participation of residents as witnesses through the process of witness support. The company employees are experienced and work effectively with agencies such as social services, youth offending, education and probation. They offer 24-hour-a-day availability and even provide training to council staff, police officers and residents. The partnership between that private company and the local authority has made an amazing difference to Stafford in a short time, as I have seen at first hand by attending one of their witness support meetings. From a standing start-their first meeting was attended by five people with an interest in the subject-the meeting that I attended had 50 witnesses present. We heard a superb report of all the injunctions, repossession proceedings and anti-social behaviour order applications that had gone to court and shown a result. At present, the company manages 24 cases in Stafford. The most important point is that the local community feels that it has won back control from the small minority who disrupted it. Through the publicity that those achievements have attracted locally, people see that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable and do not go on with it. That has created a good mood, whereas previously there was one of despair.",36705,[],Housing,0,64,housing,832
2001-11-15,Housing,477,Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,Con,False,"I am sorry to disturb the hon. Gentleman, who is making a thoughtful speech. Anti-social behaviour is, sadly, becoming a bigger problem for all areas. Ten years ago, when I became a Member of Parliament, it was almost unheard of, but it is now a common problem. Does he accept that the system of anti-social behaviour orders simply does not work, as very few are made, and that the Government need to have a completely new look at that system?",36705,[],Housing,0,65,housing,80
2001-11-15,Housing,478,David Kidney,Lab,False,"My answer is, absolutely not. Anti-social behaviour orders are working, although not enough local authorities and police apply for them. The point of being able to apply and being successful in applying is that people get the message, which is the important message that I am trying to deliver to hon. Members today. Claire Castle, who heads the company that I mentioned, said that she and her colleagues want a national witness support group to be created, because anti-social behaviour is a problem not only for local authorities, the Government, the police and housing associations but for the community as a whole. The community must take back control of its streets. There are interesting debates in Stafford and, I am sure, elsewhere, about the use of CCTV in residential areas, policing of the streets and whether neighbourhood watch is a middle-class activity or one for everybody. In Staffordshire, the police have been excellent in trying to make neighbourhood watch effective, without regard to the kinds of property in an area or the backgrounds of the people who run them. Being a member of a neighbourhood watch scheme in Stafford is a socially inclusive activity. My final good news is that, two weeks ago, I launched a care-and-repair scheme for the Stafford area. That came about because, instead of scrapping care-and-repair, as was on the cards under the previous Conservative Government-I state that as a matter of fact, not as a political point-the Government rescued it and put extra money into it. Stafford's is one of the new schemes that have been developed as a result of that commitment. It is superb to see the practical assistance being offered to elderly and disabled people: advice, help with filling in forms, or someone to tell them how to get their hands on the money and to give them support while their properties undergo the necessary renovation, repairs or adaptation. It is a marvellous scheme. Since I launched it two weeks ago, there have been hundreds of inquiries and I have already referred two constituents to it. In another two weeks' time, it will be national warm homes week 2001. That is sponsored by the warm homes campaigner, National Energy Action, and British Gas. I shall launch the health through warmth in Staffordshire scheme, part of the Â£10 million health through warmth partnership between NPower, the national health service and National Energy Action. That is especially relevant in the month in which we are waiting for the publication of the Government's fuel poverty strategy. The Minister should not let all this good news go to her head. There are still plenty of problems: too many empty homes, repossessions and evictions; too many homeless; too few affordable homes; and too little trust of local authorities. I ask the Minister to invest in housing with conviction and to give her trust to local authorities. There is nothing to be ashamed of or shy about in the work that she is doing. She should work positively and proactively with her social partners, with confidence, as she has a good story to tell and an important job to do.",36705,[],Housing,0,66,housing,522
2001-11-15,Housing,479,Adrian Sanders,LibDem,False,"It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney). I very much agree with his final comments and will go into some of them. A decent, comfortable and secure home should not be a luxury item, but more than 111,000 households lack that basic necessity. The effects of that housing deficit on society are far-reaching and costly. It is estimated that the national health service spends Â£2.4 billion annually treating health problems that are caused by homelessness or by poor housing conditions. Crime and drug use escalate dramatically among the homeless and those who are inadequately housed, as do calls upon social services and special educational services. Poor or inadequate housing directly affects the quality of life of those who experience it. Overcrowding, lack of heating, poor ventilation, condensation, inadequate insulation from noise and poor repair inevitably increase the risk of stress, family breakdown, illness-particularly mental illness-low educational attainment and contact with the criminal justice system. If stable housing is such a fundamental need that it affects people's lives so strongly and adds to demands on the taxpayer, why are more and more people doing without? There is not enough affordable housing to meet demand. Last year in my constituency, which has 1,400 families on the waiting list, less than 200 units of accommodation were allocated. Each year, more people join the list than there are units to allocate. That situation is repeated across the country. It does not have to be like that. At the beginning of the financial year 2000-01, 763,900 homes were standing empty. It is surely a duty of government to ensure that the supply of housing is related to demand, and that no one is left out in the cold because they cannot afford housing. However, Government policies have run counter to that duty for 20 years: council houses have been sold but lost stock has not been replaced; local authorities have been denied the ability to meet local housing needs; and the ability of social housing providers to meet existing demand-let alone to offer a choice of accommodation-has been underfunded. Most damaging perhaps has been the fact that Governments, including the present one, have resisted intervening in the market processes that result in the scandal of taxpayers' money being used to demolish inhabitable housing in parts of the country where there is infrastructure, while taxpayers are asked to fund new infrastructure to support privately developed housing in other parts of the country. Furthermore, that housing is often in developments of so-called executive houses that do not meet local housing need. Some developments in the south-west have had to be marketed in national papers to attract buyers.",36705,[],Housing,0,67,housing,446
2001-11-15,Housing,480,Andrew Turner,Con,False,I thank the hon. Gentleman for identifying the need for market intervention and for blaming Governments of both parties for failing to intervene. What kind of market intervention does he have in mind to solve the problem?,36705,[],Housing,0,68,housing,37
2001-11-15,Housing,481,Adrian Sanders,LibDem,False,"I shall come to that later. The market is in chaos and Government housing policy does not even begin to recognise the problem, which is a legacy of two decades of the same approach. Because of the different housing markets around the country, it makes sense for planning, fiscal and allocation responsibilities to be as localised as possible. That would require a radical rethink in Whitehall and acceptance of the fact that our centralised system of government has outlived its usefulness. It would require the creation of a pluralistic system of alternative centres of political power across the United Kingdom, in which local government was granted fiscal independence and a power of general competence to meet community needs, including local housing needs. Giving local authorities more control over housing, planning and policy would make the system more accountable to the people and make it possible to tailor solutions to local demand. As things stand, councils are restricted in their ability to replace their diminishing housing stock using the proceeds of the right-to-buy scheme. That is like shooting someone in the foot and asking them to walk to hospital. Councils have been so hampered in their efforts to accomplish anything that they completed only 400 homes last year. In 1990-91, by contrast, 16,500 dwellings were completed. I accept that that was under a Conservative Government. Will the Minister tell us how much more money, as a percentage of GDP, is being spent on housing today than was spent under the last Conservative Government? I have a feeling that it is less. We should encourage councils to expand their stock as much as possible rather than placing obstacles in their path.",36705,[],Housing,0,69,housing,279
2001-11-15,Housing,482,Andrew Love,Lab,False,The hon. Gentleman mentioned the right to buy. The logic unfolding in his speech appeared to support a suspension of that right in areas of high demand. Is that what he suggests?,36705,[],Housing,0,70,housing,32

I do not think that the solution should be imposed from the centre. I am not opposed to the right to buy. In my view it should be possible to use the proceeds from such sales to replace lost stock. Although the right to buy certainly puts a strain on the provision of social housing, it is not the only culprit in the reduction in affordable housing.",36705,[],Housing,0,71,housing,83
2001-11-15,Housing,484,Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,Con,False,"The hon. Gentleman will have heard me say that by 2004 more than half of all public sector housing will be in the registered social landlord sector. Do the Liberal Democrats approve or disapprove of large-scale voluntary transfers, which give local authorities considerable additional cash to build more social housing units?",36705,[],Housing,0,72,housing,51
2001-11-15,Housing,485,Adrian Sanders,LibDem,False,"I was going to discuss stock transfer in a moment. Again, that is a matter on which each local authority must decide. The question of whether tenants would be better off with stock transfer under existing centralised rules depends on the level of debt, which can differ greatly from authority to authority. Ultimately, tenants have to vote according to the circumstances in their area. I do not approach the matter from an ideological position; I am interested in what works best for tenants in a given area. As the quality of life in some of our inner cities and urban areas declines, more and more people aspire to living outside, particularly in rural areas. Consequently, they push up prices and price out local people, who then increase the demand for social housing in the very areas with the least of it. In addition, the demand for second homes or weekend retreats inflates house prices still further and sometimes undermines the viability of local schools, shops and bus services. In some west country villages, a majority of homes are occupied only when their owners grace the area with their presence. They do not use local services, which struggle to survive with fewer permanent customers. Not only do second homes inflate local housing prices and undermine businesses and public services, but their owners are also given a tax break. Abolishing the 50 per cent. council tax rebate on second homes will make the system more equitable, but the extra revenue raised must be given back to the local authorities concerned to allow them to subsidise threatened services or to contribute to new social housing stock. If the Government will not free up local government, perhaps they could at least make the system fairer by introducing a level playing field for social housing providers. Why not allow councils to borrow to build, repair or renovate on the same terms as non-statutory housing providers? Are the Government frightened that such competition might give tenants a real choice between stock transfer and remaining with their local authority? If all types of housing providers could compete to meet local housing needs, would we not see a reduction in waiting lists and more choice for those in need of such housing? The Government's priority must be to provide more homes, which means increasing investment. An investment in housing is an investment in communities, areas and neighbourhoods, not just in bricks and mortar. However, the homes must be affordable, which means changing the housing benefit system. Affordable rents are a key component in any plan to tackle poverty. If left to the market alone, housing costs would exacerbate poverty. Affordable rents can be achieved in only two ways, or through a mix of both. The first is to regulate rent levels, although the risk is that the private sector will pull out as market suppliers. The second is to provide public grant or subsidy through cash payments to landlord or tenant, thereby funding the difference between a market rent and an affordable one. Whatever the reform, housing support should not be restricted by housing tenure. Assistance should also be available to those who wish to buy or part-buy housing. Society pays dearly for poor housing. Decent, affordable housing brings more than economic benefits. Social housing providers make a long-term investment in the areas in which they operate, and are well placed to support neighbourhood renewal. The Government are not serious about tackling the housing crisis-they merely tinker at the edges of the problem-and the Conservative Opposition seem obsessed with the number, rather than the type, of homes that need to be built. A radical rethink on where decisions are taken and a commitment to invest in social housing are long overdue.",36705,[],Housing,0,73,housing,623

2001-11-15,Housing,487,Oona King,Lab,False,"I shall endeavour to lose half of my speech as I proceed. As ever, I am pleased to contribute to a debate on housing, which remains the most pressing problem in my constituency. I have often described my constituency as a tale of two cities, because the affluence of the City and riverside living in glass penthouses in docklands contrasts with poverty, deprivation and hopelessness in the borough that ranks first on the deprivation index. When Charles Dickens wrote "" A Tale of Two Cities"" in 1859, he opened it with lines that apply to today: "" It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"". One could say that about housing in east London. It is the best of times: the Government have tripled the amount of money we have to spend on social housing. It is the worst of times: some families in east London, and elsewhere around the country, live in housing as bad as any seen in this country in the past 50 years. I am pleased that the provisions in part II of the Homes Bill have been quickly brought back in this Parliament in the Homelessness Bill, which fulfils our 1997 manifesto commitment. It will put right the appalling injustice heaped upon people who are homeless by the previous Conservative Administration. This debate will allow hon. Members to reflect on concerns that we had during the early stages of the Homelessness Bill, and to highlight wider policy issues. I tabled an amendment to the Homes Bill to introduce greater protection for those experiencing racial harassment, so I am pleased that that issue has been dealt with comprehensively in the Homelessness Bill. I am equally pleased to hear about the progress that has been made on the bed-and-breakfast targets following the establishment of the bed-and-breakfast taskforce. Families should not live in what are often appalling conditions in bed and breakfasts for anything other than a short initial assessment period. The Government have placed on a statutory footing an applicant's right to accept an offer and simultaneously request a review of its suitability. The court judgment in March on this issue was enormously disappointing. It particularly affects applicants in Tower Hamlets because they get only 24 hours to decide whether to accept an offer. The Homelessness Bill will make the position clear, and I am glad that there has been no dissent about that provision coming into effect as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. I am disappointed that we could not persuade Ministers to give applicants a statutory three-day period to decide whether to accept an offer. The homeless have a right to seek independent advice, and as legislators we have an obligation to ensure that they receive the time that they need to get that advice. It would benefit my constituents if, in the Minister's closing remarks, she would make it plain that she regards a three-day period as the bare minimum to which the homeless should be entitled. In the absence of legislation, such a statement is the only thing that gives me any prospect of convincing the London borough of Tower Hamlets that its current 24-hour period is insufficient. Similarly, I hope that the Minister will continue to press her colleagues in the Department of Health to close the loophole thrown open by the High Court ruling in May that social services have no obligation to intentionally homeless parents of children assessed as vulnerable and in need. We are forcing homeless parents to choose between having their children sleep on the streets or having them taken into care, which is no choice at all. Ministers have a chance, which they must take, to end that practice by amending the Adoption and Children Bill, which is currently in Special Standing Committee. I hope that the Minister will give a commitment that the extra costs that local authorities will incur in meeting their new duties will be fully funded. I have raised that matter with her before. The Government mentioned a figure of Â£8 million to help with those costs, but that may fall short of what is needed. Some authorities have estimated substantial extra costs resulting from the requirement to examine the applications of 16 and 17-year-olds. The Government were right to give 16 and 17-year-olds extra protection, but would be wrong to put the cost on to local authority housing budgets, which are already stretched to breaking point. The Minister will have received a copy of the response by the London group of Labour MPs to the public consultation on the forthcoming national homelessness strategy. The strategy must address two key priorities: first, the use of temporary accommodation must be reduced, especially by families with children; secondly, homelessness among those not eligible for priority need under the new legislation must be tackled and prevented. Skipping several pages of my speech, I move on to the Government's commitment to a decent home for all by 2010. Everyone must remember that that commitment is not just to those picked up by the homelessness safety net. It is also to parents sharing a bedroom with their young children, or sleeping in the living room. It is a commitment to teenage brothers and sisters who have to share a bedroom. I met a 19-year-old girl who had been sharing a bedroom with her father for most of her life. It is a commitment to teachers, nurses and police officers who cannot afford to live in the areas where their services are desperately needed. It is a commitment to all the young people in London who cannot afford to rent or buy a place to live in the area where they were born and grew up. It is a commitment to disabled tenants stuck at the top of tower blocks with lifts that do not work, and to the many young mothers with toddlers who are stuck with prams on the eighth or twelfth floor and cannot get in or out of their accommodation. Finally, it is a commitment to pensioners left isolated and afraid in unsuitable and dilapidated accommodation. To fulfil that commitment, we must have the funding. It is imperative for London to retain its existing share of approved development programme funding. I hope that, even at this late stage, a forward-looking household growth indicator can be included in the formula. That would guarantee ADP funding for the tens of thousands of new affordable homes that London needs. I shall skip more pages to enable other hon. Members to contribute, but I will mention the transfer process. I pay tribute to one-stop transfer that has taken place in Tower Hamlets. Tower Hamlets Community Housing, under the determined leadership of Mike Tyrrell, is already ahead of the planned estate redevelopment schedule. It is important, however, to recognise that the stock transfer process in general needs support. I give it unreserved support in Tower Hamlets, but Shelter's recent report "" Out of Stock"" makes it clear that other local authorities have not been so good in ensuring that their contracts give people who transfer the greatest possible protection. That has had a detrimental effect on housing outcomes for homeless applicants. We should accept Shelter's recommendations, which are: first, that the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions review its current guidelines on stock transfer; secondly, that changes be made to the regulations governing the contracting out of homelessness and housing functions; and, thirdly, that greater emphasis be placed on meeting need in the Housing Corporation's regulatory code and statutory housing management guidance. My final remarks are on the funding needed for affordable housing. We are not funding the building of enough social houses. The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) mentioned the right-to-buy scheme. I have an astonishing statistic: in London last year, more than 11,000 council properties were sold off but only 3,000 new units were built to replace them. In my experience, right to buy has been the single most disastrous policy. Although I agree that people should have the right to buy, we must safeguard the amount of stock that is available for social housing and consider other ways of doing so-for example, through the right to acquire. An extra Â£1.25 billion a year is needed in the housing budget. I urge the Minister to do everything in her power to persuade our colleagues in the Treasury that that money must be invested in socially affordable housing.",36705,[],Housing,0,75,housing,1408

I fully accept the great need to discuss homelessness and provision for those people who require homes, but I want to talk about the house-building targets that are issued to councils by central Government. It is wrong for central Government to dictate to local communities how many houses they are to build over the next 15 years.

2001-11-15,Housing,492,John Baron,Con,False,"No. I have given way once. I want to make some progress, as other hon. Members want to speak. The imposition of targets is yet another example of central Government infringing the rights and freedoms of individuals. The imposition of mobile phone masts on local communities and the increasing burden of regulation and red tape on small businesses are other such infringements. I, like my party, believe that elected representatives in local councils are better placed to make decisions about local planning, because they are democratically accountable and better informed about its impact on their community. The Government should recognise that. The other implication of imposing housing targets is the effect on infrastructure. In my constituency, the local hospital, police force, schools and doctors' surgeries suffer tremendous strain in trying to cope with the increasing demands that are placed on them. However, the Government want to impose more houses on local communities, which will only add to the strain on the infrastructure, not only in my constituency, but in many others, particularly in the south-east. For example, in the area surrounding the Wick housing development there is a clear shortage of school places and GP facilities, and the bus services are inadequate, but although that is recognised, there remains a proposal to build even more houses without putting in adequate infrastructure.",36705,[],Housing,0,80,housing,221

That is the case not only in my constituency, but in the country as a whole.

It is ridiculous to impose housing targets on rural areas outside London on the assumption that people from the inner city will want to live in villages and in executive homes, which are what invariably spring up all over the place. We must concentrate on the regeneration of inner cities and brownfield sights, not build on the greenfield sites of the south-east.",36705,[],Housing,0,83,housing,111
2001-11-15,Housing,496,John Baron,Con,False,"I agree 100 per cent. with my hon. Friend. We must ensure that we have the right houses for the right areas, but that can only happen if local communities make those decisions, and are not forced to suffer centrally imposed targets. Government plans to build on vast swathes of our countryside will have a huge and damaging impact on the environment. The visual landscape will be ruined, and the impact of new developments on traffic growth has not been properly assessed. Building new homes in areas away from existing towns and cities will mean more people using their cars to go to work, to take children to school and even to visit their GPs. Without new roads, tremendous traffic congestion will be created and will add to the woes already suffered by communities, particularly in the south-east. I believe that the Government population forecasts and estimates submitted by various Departments are surrounded by uncertainty. The rise in the number of single-person households is fuelling household growth. According to the Government's figures, seven out of 10 households that will be formed over the next 20 years will be single-person households-I appreciate that that is a difficult figure to estimate, but those are the Government statistics. However, Labour's proposals for new building are more likely to result in premium, luxury and executive family homes on greenfield sites, as they will generate the biggest returns. We are discussing the problem of homelessness and the number of empty houses in our country. Those proposals are a prime example of a Government-led strategy, dictated from the centre, failing to help with the problem of homelessness and empty houses. Such a strategy disregards the reason for the general growth in demand for houses. I hope that the Minister will carefully consider that fundamental issue, because if it were attended to, it could help to ease an awful lot of the pain that the Government will inflict on councils in the south-east. Single, elderly or young people will not want to live in the new developments. Too often they are devoid of local transport links, making it difficult for people without cars to go shopping, to go to work or even to visit the local doctor's surgery. Labour is building the wrong houses in the wrong places.

It is proving increasingly difficult to attract young people to train in craft skills such as bricklaying, plumbing and carpentry. Current Government education policy is geared towards encouraging school leavers to stay on for further education, whereas many would probably be better trained as apprentices in skills such as those I have mentioned. It is a matter of deep concern in most of the crafts that, even though apprenticeships are now more readily available, the number of people seeking them is falling each year. Of particular note is the number of women entering the construction industry. That was already low, but it has fallen dramatically in the past two to three years. What are the Government doing to help industry overcome the shortage of craft skills in the house-building industry? Without those crafts we shall not fulfil our pledges to improve housing stock or build new houses. We have heard today about the poor state of some accommodation. About 1.5 million dwellings are classified as unfit for human habitation. I am aware that the Government have announced a commitment to ensure that all social housing is of a decent standard by the end of the decade. That is an extremely tall order. However, in the private sector greater incentives are needed for people to improve their properties and, critically, not to use cowboy builders for that work. Hon. Members receive numerous letters from people afflicted by cowboy builders. What progress are the Government making towards their target of bringing all social housing up to a decent standard by 2010? It is important that social landlords and others should improve housing stock. Will the Minister try to persuade the Treasury of the benefit of reducing VAT on domestic repair and maintenance to 5 per cent., as other countries have done?

However, by the same logic, one cannot claim that the housing demand in the inner-city areas of London and the south-east can be matched with the low demand for the empty properties in the north of England. That will not work. We must develop regional solutions, which means that areas such as his must be part of the solution.",36705,[],Housing,0,94,housing,95
2001-11-15,Housing,507,Gregory Barker,Con,False,"I do not accept that we are a divided nation of regions. If we build more houses, we shall fuel housing demand. In the south-east, the more we build, the more insatiable that demand will become. What we need is sustainable, economic development in the north and the preservation of greenfield areas in the south. I am not proposing a blanket ban on housing in the south-east, but I totally reject the Serplan targets for my area, which are supported both by Labour and by the Liberal Democrats. Under the Serplan guidelines, 224,000 houses have already been earmarked for greenfield sites. At the current average density of 23 dwellings per hectare, those homes would cover an area of 98 sq km, which is more than twice the size of Crawley. That would be madness. In my own area, we have good reason for not wanting more housing imposed from the centre, as the infrastructure is lacking to provide for it. The Government had an opportunity to put that infrastructure into place last summer when, after years of delay and dodging, they finally vetoed the Hastings bypass. That bypass would have provided a major arterial route, bringing economic development to Hastings, which is an area of high social exclusion. It would also have released land behind Bexhill that would have been appropriate for housing. Although the road is not now to go ahead, the housing target is still in situ. As a result, many of my constituents are extremely worried that the Government will insist on houses being built inappropriately in ribbon developments in areas of outstanding natural beauty in our Wealden villages or, even worse, on the flood plains. In Robertsbridge in my constituency, houses have been built in inappropriate areas that are now subject to ruinous flooding. Our area cannot take any more houses. I also want to discuss the design and quality of housing. There would be less resistance to new housing developments in my area-and across the country-if the quality of design were higher. New housing developments, particularly those in rural areas, are often uniform, drab and of low quality. If there were greater emphasis on better design, more sympathy with vernacular architecture and greater thought given to the tastes and demands of local people, we might see the erection of buildings that pleased local communities instead of inciting their hostility. Next Monday, I shall take a group of planners, councillors and council officials from all parties in my area to see the Prince of Wales development in Poundbury, Dorchester. We should learn some good lessons about building sustainable communities with a mix of social and other types of housing, and with buildings for work and leisure, that are built in a way that is sympathetic to that part of the world. I am not seeking to prescribe any one particular design or architectural style for my area, although I have a great deal of sympathy for the use of traditional vernacular architecture in rural areas. However, I believe that quality of design matters a great deal. Insufficient attention is paid to it, whether in social or executive housing. I hope that the housing that must be built to meet the needs of local communities in my area in the years to come will be of a high quality, and will reflect the architectural traditions of those communities.",36705,[],Housing,0,95,housing,561
2001-11-15,Housing,508,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"I agree with the hon. Members for Bexhill and Battle (Mr. Barker) and for Billericay (Mr. Baron) that infrastructure is essential. However, those of us who represent areas with very high demand face many of the same problems. In the past week I have met residents of the Dalgarno estate in north Kensington and the Warwick and Brindley estate in north Westminster, which consists of six 20-storey tower blocks and a low-rise estate. They are currently arguing with the council and registered social landlords about the building of additional infill accommodation. Those residents point to a level of density and a pressure on housing, particularly for those on low incomes and with high levels of social need. I am not a popular person with those residents because I am prepared to say to them that we must tackle the issue of additional housing provision. I understand all their reasons for not wanting to do that, but housing demand and the problems that it causes are so acute and intense that we cannot hold out against such provision. We must concentrate our arguments on the problem of infrastructure. We need a regional solution for London, and that must be set in a wider context. In the old days of the Greater London council, its seaside housing initiative was one of the most successful housing policies ever run by a public organisation. It made a positive contribution to the problem of housing need, and I would like such an initiative to be revived. The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle picked up on the reference to regional policy in my intervention. There is no flood of housing demand from the north of England that must be turned around. We are not dealing with that kind of population growth in London. My constituency contains two local authority areas-Kensington and Westminster-with the highest population growth in the country, but there is no huge influx of people from other regions with low housing demand. The problem in London arises from several factors, including the decline in social lettings during recent years, much of which is attributable to the impact of high house prices leading to people not moving out of social accommodation. Household formation and international migration, including asylum seekers-although that is a smaller and often overrated aspect of the problem-have also caused some rise in demand. A large part of the problem is the collapse of the private rented sector for people on low incomes. That must be dealt with. My major point, which I have made a thousand and one times to the Minister and others, is about London, its problems and the need for assistance in dealing with them. London now has 52,000 households in temporary accommodation-the highest number on record. London's boroughs are accommodating a homeless population the size of Reading. There are nearly 3,500 homeless people in my constituency alone, including 450 in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. London has two thirds of the homeless households and three quarters of the total number of families in bed and breakfast in the country. Yet the funding formula is skewed against the capital, despite the extra investment allocated to us through the comprehensive spending review, which I recognise and warmly welcome. The distribution formula is about to cause us serious problems. Those problems are relative. I accept that there is still growth, but that growth is not adequate to deal with the trend of housing need. Factors relating to low demand are included in the general needs index formula, but issues of affordability and household population growth, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King), are not. The relative loss to London-taking into account what we should receive-is Â£128 million, which is equivalent to around 1,300 additional housing units. It is unacceptable and inexplicable that areas with high housing demand, which are in housing crisis, should be penalised by the funding formula. That is counter-intuitive, contrary to the objectives of the housing Green Paper and will make the work of the bed-and-breakfast unit much harder.",36705,[],Housing,0,96,housing,677

2001-11-15,Housing,510,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"The hon. Gentleman can make his own case, which I am sure he is more than capable of doing. My job is to make my case. There is an urgent need for the housing needs formula-the general needs index-to be revised and for the relative loss to London to be redressed. I welcome the Minister's comments on overcrowding and the revision of the statutory overcrowding formula. We have understandably concentrated on the high visibility housing issues of rough sleeping and bed and breakfast. I am delighted with the establishment of the bed-and-breakfast unit, and wish it well, but we must not forget the hidden homelessness that afflicts my area and the constituencies of a number of hon. Members. I shall refer to some of my constituents to highlight the problem. The Koudrai family, which consists of the parents and four children aged seven, six, three and one, share two bedrooms. Under the space standards element of the statutory overcrowding legislation, they are not overcrowded because the living room is of sufficient size to allow the adults to use it as a bedroom. The Bowen family, on the other hand, which consists of one adult and six children aged 13, 11, 10, eight, four and 18 months, are now officially overcrowded as the 10-year-old has become a person for the purpose of the rules. However, they remain between 8th and 17th on the list for four-bedroomed accommodation. That raises the question of what conditions other households have to cope with, but we know nothing about those conditions because for many years local authorities have not kept adequate records of statutory overcrowding or other overcrowding needs, because the legislation was so out of date. I also cite the case of the Hassan family in Kensington, which consists of two adults and three children who live in a very small two-bedroomed flat on the third floor. Two of the children are disabled and statemented with autism. The family has the most medical points available to them but still only has 30 points in total, and the council explained that people with most priority have around 200 housing points. Some hon. Members may be able imagine what it is like to share a small two-bedroomed flat with three children, two of whom are autistic, but I certainly cannot. I find it hard enough to live with one child. The demand for housing represented by those examples, and the stress and the physical and mental damage that living in such conditions causes those households, is almost impossible to contemplate. We urgently need to update the overcrowding standards. When considering allocation of resources, we should consider not only the visible and dramatic end of the housing spectrum, however hideous it is for families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, but housing need in the round. Like the rough sleepers initiative, the bed-and-breakfast unit will do a great deal of good, because it will have high visibility. A strong case exists for numerical targets for a reduction in demand, although Ashley Horsley said in The Guardian yesterday that he was not sympathetic. I believe that there is no alternative. Unless we have numerical targets to reduce the numbers living in bed and breakfast accommodation, we will not be able to monitor progress. I urge the Minister to consider that point. The bed-and-breakfast unit could consider not simply how quickly people can be moved out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation but how to create a better package of support services. The Minister has done good work in that area already, but the Victoria ClimbiÃ© inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language, or have other communication problems, and are highly mobile. The Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other ClimbiÃ© cases waiting to happen. We hope that they do not, but the risk exists because of mobility in the temporary accommodation sector. There is a strong case for targeting the next wave of the sure start programme on wards with a great deal of bed-and-breakfast accommodation, as they tend not to be highly ranked on the index of multiple deprivation. As for family accommodation, the private rented sector does not provide a desirable long-term alternative to the social rented sector or to affordable homes for purchase, but it is an essential transitional stage and can help those who, for example, are moving to seek employment. I commend to the Minister the work of the Brent private tenants rights group, which has produced an excellent document-entitled "" The Private Rented Sector: Problem or Solution?""-that contains a good analysis of the difficulties. The problem is that the supply of private rented sector accommodation in London has halved in the past five years. The quality is very variable, and because of housing benefit restrictions the relationship between the private rented sector, families on low income and poverty is highly significant. The Government have recognised that in their "" market of despair"" research in Brent, and the matter is now a priority. The document sets out a number of solutions. It suggests bringing the needs of landlords and tenants together in a proper package of measures that include ending tax discrimination in respect of landlords who let properties, promoting adequate management standards-that ties in with the licensing of homes in multiple occupation-and abolishing local reference rents and allowing rent officers to take away from rent assessment committees the role of rent termination. Rent officers are closer to the ground, and such a move would increase transparency and allow greater flexibility in meeting tenants' needs. As an added incentive for renting to low-income households, the document also recommends the excellent idea of a 5 per cent. supplement for landlords who set rents for tenants on housing benefit. That idea is worthy of analysis and I commend it to the Minister. Research by Cambridge Housing and Planning Research, which was commissioned by Shelter, shows that contraction of the private rented sector's contribution to housing need could be adding 10,000 people to the annual affordable housing requirement. Put another way, investing in returning the sector to its mid-1990s position is the equivalent of spending Â£700 million on new housing. The reform of housing benefit cannot wait until we have achieved rent convergence. The Minister is aware of my deep reservations about the implications of rent restructuring. I am particularly worried about capital values and the possibility of high target rents in London and other high-value areas. We must urgently consider measures such as setting a cap of no more than Â£100 a week and allowing a high degree of local variation in respect of landlords who let properties that will be affected by high-target rents. Time is of the essence, as the proposals will come into force next April. This complex pattern of rent restructuring could blow up in our faces, and I urge the Minister to ensure that we do not run into serious problems. Before we achieve the admirable objective of greater coherence and consistency between local authority social landlords and the private rented sector, we should make rapid progress by improving administration. For example, we could put pensioners into a separate housing benefit strand, set fixed terms for housing benefit claims and improve work incentives. Those suggestions are set out in two recent documents: the Audit Commission's review of the administration of housing benefit, and an excellent policy document by Pivot, entitled "" Hope for Housing Benefit"". The latter document makes the important point that if we do not seize the moment and integrate housing benefit more effectively as we enter a new phase of tackling poverty through tax credits and increased work incentives, it will not work as effectively in London and other areas of high housing cost as it does in the rest of the country. As a result, it will not be as successful as it should be in helping to tackle poverty. As many hon. Members have stressed, the main issue in dealing with these problems is supply, supply, supply. We will not deal with any of them in the long term without a major increase in housing investment in areas of housing need. Under planning guidance, 50 per cent. of new build in London should be affordable homes through developments under section 106 agreements. That was recommended by the Mayor's housing commission, of which I was a member, and I strongly support that. I welcome the Secretary of State's indication that he might consider allowing councils to demand affordable homes from commercial developments as well. There is a lack of logic in insisting on affordable housing in those housing developments, and not in commercial ones. We should level that playing field. The Government's commitment to public services and to tackling poverty is not in doubt, and has been demonstrated during the past few years. Without a decent home over people's heads, however, it will be hard to realise all the objectives and to make the best use of the new wave of anti-poverty measures and public sector investment being introduced.",36705,[],Housing,0,98,housing,1520

The problem that we have not faced is how to deal with abandonment. I have not yet heard a single answer to the problem of abandonment of properties in areas of high supply and obvious lack of demand. Will the Minister explain why additional housing is permitted in large rural areas in the south and the north of the country, when there is clearly a surplus of supply in some urban areas?

Friends the Members for Billericay (Mr. Baron) and for Bexhill and Battle (Mr. Barker), except to point out that my local authority-I do not usually attack the Isle of Wight council in this place, although I often do at home-sent someone to Serplan who voted in favour of the Government's target of 8,000 new houses on the Isle of Wight. That may not sound much compared with Essex, but it is enough for a small area. Of those 8,000 houses, 40 per cent. are to be built on greenfield sites-a target that is being implemented through the unitary development plan. I welcome the Government's publication of PPG3 with its 60 per cent. target for brownfield sites, but that document has no teeth as far as Isle of Wight council is concerned. It is happily giving its approval for building on greenfield sites, and the brownfield sites will never catch up. I criticise the approval in the unitary development plan for more houses without adequate parking space in both rural and urban areas. It is not good enough to take away car parks, and especially commuter car parks, from towns, because if people are to use public transport they must have somewhere to park at the end of their public transport journey. People can no longer drive their cars into Cowes on their way to work, because the Government have taken out of the unitary development plan some of the already limited parking space in the town centre. The other problem with which we must deal is housing quality. I echo the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle. His comments also apply to social housing. Some of the social housing that is being built is frankly tat. It is poor quality: it is of a poor standard; its common areas are little more than deserts; and it has inadequate parking spaces, which is a problem because people who live in social housing also want to own cars. It also has inadequate private space. People who live in social housing want private space because they do not want to bring up children in flats, which admittedly are not as high in my area as some in London.",36705,[],Housing,0,101,housing,433

People who need or desire to live in social housing have a right to live in decent houses with adequate private spaces and places to park their cars. I welcome the remarks made by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) on anti-social behaviour orders. They should be implemented not only by the sometimes reluctant local authorities-my local authority has not implemented one-but by both registered social landlords and the private sector. Why should people not apply for a private anti-social behaviour order to see whether the courts will uphold it? We should allow people to bring forward traffic orders to deal with problems of parking for residents, which many local authorities relegate to the end of their programme. The problem of inadequate parking should be dealt with so that residents do not concrete over their front gardens in sheer despair at their inability to park. Such problems reduce people's quality of life. Who pays for the social housing element of private development? There is a distinct difference between the prices that can be obtained in London for private sector housing, to the obvious detriment of many of London's people, and the prices that can be obtained in other parts of the country, including my constituency. In London, the profits made from building private housing are so great that the cost of social housing is, in effect, met by the developer. If the cost is 10 per cent. or whatever, the developer reduces his profit accordingly to provide space for social housing. However, it is difficult to develop a site on the Isle of Wight, or any rural area, where prices are low, because it is hard for the developer to make a significant profit. He will make sufficient profit, but he will not make a significant profit, and he will not necessarily be willing to lose that profit as a result of providing for 10 per cent. social housing. Ultimately, the purchaser pays. In some areas, social housing is a tax on the developer, as is right and proper, but in other areas it is a tax on the first-time buyer. I hope that the Government will consider that when they make their housing allocations to registered social landlords, so that they do not have to depend to the same extent on taxing the first-time buyer.",36705,[],Housing,0,103,housing,401
2001-11-15,Housing,516,Brian Iddon,Lab,False,"I begin with a topic that is dear to your heart, Mr. Pike-the condition of private sector stock. Let me tell Conservative Members exactly why private sector stock is in such a bad condition. They talk about terraces of houses that are completely empty. Those houses are more than 120 years old. Unlike houses in the rest of the country, they were built on the cheap by factory owners within walking distance of the mills. They were built with brick-on-end foundations, with inner and outer skins touching, and with attics that were common to the entire terrace, which presents a real hazard when one of the properties catches fire. The reason why tens of thousands of those properties are empty in your constituency of Burnley, Mr. Pike, in Eccles, in Salford and in Bolton is that nobody wants to live in them any more. During 18 years of Conservative government, no money was made available either to improve them or to clear and replace them. Now we are stuck with the problem. The Government are wrestling with it and I am sorry to say that they will be doing so for a long time. The densely populated inner parts of Salford, Bolton and Burnley need places for children to play. When houses are cleared, more houses should not be put back on the sites: we need green lungs, as in London. Wherever I go in London, I walk past a park. That is not true of many of the old wool towns in Yorkshire, or the cotton towns in Lancashire. The figures for Bolton are staggering. According to environmental health officers, we have 22,000 unfit properties, 5,000 to 6,000 of which are considered to be irredeemably unfit, yet people still live in them. I agree with the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) that we need more living space. If he were to visit Bolton, I would show him the two-up, two-downs with small backyards.

2001-11-15,Housing,518,Brian Iddon,Lab,False,"I am sorry, but I do not have time. If urban regeneration is to mean anything in towns and constituencies like mine, we must have the money to deal with such properties. They cannot be allowed to stand derelict and empty. Drug addicts inherit privately owned properties because private landlords buy them one by one for a few quid and reap large amounts of housing benefit by letting them to desperate people. Next door may live elderly people who are frightened of going out. Yards have rubbish dumped in them, which attracts vermin. None of our constituents wants to live in such conditions. I plead with the Government to help constituencies like mine to deal with those mega housing problems. We need to clear properties that are beyond repair. The Government have been excellent at releasing capital receipts and working on neighbourhood renewal, but they are not getting to the heart of the problem. Cutting my speech short, as have all other hon. Members, I turn briefly to the public sector. I have long argued that we should try to move away from the public sector borrowing requirement model of supporting public sector housing. At one stage, I thought that the general Government financial deficit model would be put into operation. Can the Minister confirm that? I understand that, of all the countries in the European Union, only this country and the Netherlands operate the public sector borrowing requirement model. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong on that. I was not present at the Labour party conference, so did not hear the Secretary of State announce possible alternative financing of public sector housing, which has caused so much excitement in the housing arena. Will the Minister tell me about that? We need to borrow against our considerable assets because it makes sense and is done elsewhere in Europe. Why cannot public authorities borrow not only against the tenanted value of their properties, but against considerable rent streams. Will she clarify what the Secretary of State said in Brighton, which appears to have been denied by the housing press? Will the Minister also look at the model, called a community regeneration company, presented to her by the director of housing in Bolton? If tenants must choose an alternative form of housing management, I ask her seriously to consider that model, which is not in the housing Green Paper but is recognised by people as a satisfactory alternative to proposals in it and has now been submitted to the Department. Best-value considerations have shown that the model is better than the options that the Government have suggested for Bolton and other authorities. Will she please consider it? I am not against tenants having a choice of an alternative landlord, particularly if they have a bad one, which could even be a local authority. However, under successive Governments, Bolton has been one of the few north-west towns to have been given all the brownie points for housing management for, I think, nine out of 10 successive years. That is an incredible performance. If the tenants, local government and national Government are happy with the management, why should local authorities be put under extreme pressure to transfer either management or the ownership of their stock to an alternative landlord? That does not make sense to me. Surely, we can leave a few well-managed local authorities with their own stock to look after, because an awful lot of people are now in the queue for stock transfer. Finally, has the Minister seriously considered securitisation as an alternative means of financing housing in the public sector? That is a hot topic in the housing press.",36705,[],Housing,0,106,housing,612
2001-11-15,Housing,519,Margaret Moran,Lab,False,"The events of the past few months are a timely reminder that the Government's commitment to the delivery of public services must be underpinned by the provision of good-quality housing. The crisis in recruitment, spoken about earlier, is a reminder that healthy housing markets and good-quality housing are essential to achieving many of the Government's key priorities, especially neighbourhood renewal. The improvement of public services could otherwise be undermined by an acute shortage of affordable housing, with intermediate housing being lost in some areas and problems of market failure and local deprivation in others. We should take note of the unrest in areas such as Bradford, which, in terms of demography, ethnicity and housing conditions, is similar to my constituency. I was told by our local police that, had it not rained on the Saturday subsequent to the riot, a similar event would have occurred in Luton. That is hardly conducive to building a healthy community. It is important to recognise that in areas such as mine, and in Bradford, there is overcrowding and an acute shortage of social housing. Owner-occupied housing is in poor condition with few resources to upgrade it because they are focused elsewhere. As a result, areas such as Bury park perform badly in all the indices of deprivation, including child mortality, high levels of heart disease and a horrifying rise in cases of tuberculosis, which is usually thought of as the disease of the poor. Homelessness, overcrowding and lack of investment must be tackled now through urgent intervention in such areas. Although Luton generally has an acute housing crisis in areas such as Stopsley and Farley, special attention needs to be paid to areas where the housing crisis is magnified because of a multiplicity of deprivation. In Luton, the general and black and minority ethnic housing needs survey has shown the council the worrying levels of current and projected need in the town. According to data, in excess of 6,500 households are currently in need, and that will rise over the next five years to nearly 10,000. Half of those people will be looking to the council to provide affordable housing. In the Bangladeshi and Pakistani community, households are four times as likely to be living in unsuitable housing as white households, and the average income of Bangladeshi households is around Â£5,000, compared with Â£17,000 in white households. The survey found that about 5 per cent. of white households were in need, whereas the comparative figures were 37 per cent. of Bangladeshi households and 30 per cent. of Pakistani households in need. There is therefore acute need in particular areas, which we must address. As for the private rented sector and owner-occupation, demand and supply difficulties are exacerbated by the results of the private rented housing stock condition survey that was recently undertaken by the council, which shows high levels of disrepair in the town. More than 7,000 households in Luton are already in unsuitable housing, which is more than 10 per cent. of all households. It therefore has a bigger problem of disrepair than other comparable areas. What needs to be done to tackle those problems? Greater priority must be given to investment in renovation of existing dilapidated stock. Greater focus should also be given to a strategy for empty housing. In Luton, for every one homeless family, there are seven empty private rented sector properties. I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the need to review VAT on refurbishment, to enable us to bring those urgently needed properties back into use. In respect of social housing, for which there is acute need across the town, there is even more pressing need for family-sized accommodation with four bedrooms and a bathroom. However, there is no opportunity in areas such as mine to new build our way out of that problem. We are landlocked. We must therefore focus more on increasing Housing Corporation funding for acquisition and refurbishment, which I know from my experience as a chief executive of a housing association is inevitably more expensive than new build. That needs to be reflected in the financing of that part of the programme. We welcome the doubling of the approved development programme for housing associations. However, we must also recognise that we must build on brownfield sites that are contaminated, which are inevitably of higher cost than new-build sites. We must ensure that those higher costs are reflected in the Housing Corporation allocations so that we can achieve our brownfield targets. The vision for healthy communities in the urban and rural White Paper depends critically on healthier housing markets. Greater and more strategic investment in housing is necessary, as well as much more effective co-ordination with economic and neighbourhood renewal strategies at national, regional and sub-regional level. As we approach the next spending round, I want my hon. Friend the Minister to make certain requests in her discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. As many other hon. Members have said, we urgently need an increase in the supply of new social housing. In some areas, there is an acute housing need, especially in the south-east. We have heard about the problems in London, but they are not exclusive to London. East Anglia has similar problems. We need a programme for an extra 20,000 units to tackle the problem of key workers and to keep our households out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation, which is more expensive. It is estimated that, in 2003-04, that would cost an extra Â£6 million. I hope that Ministers will be calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer for that added investment. There also needs to be increased investment in existing regeneration programmes so that they can be maintained at their present value. There is a distinct query about how much of the existing regeneration programmes are concentrating on housing. Given that many of them are time limited, there is a severe question mark over the level of housing resources in the future. That needs to be examined. We must maintain investment in existing housing stock in order for the 10-year target to be met. I hope that the Minister will be dealing with such problems when she discusses matters with the Chancellor. As other hon. Members have said, we do not need a shift of resources away from areas of acute housing need, such as London and the south-east, to areas of low demand. That conflicts with the overall objective of the review set by the housing Green Paper to focus investment resources in areas of greatest housing need. It also conflicts with the Government's recently announced objective o reduce the use of temporary and bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Will the Minister reconsider such issues? During the next 10 years, we must set targets for overcoming the backlog of need in affordable housing to parallel the targets that have already been set to tackle the problem of rough sleepers, and that we should have to tackle the use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We need to set an annual target for reducing the number of homeless people who are placed in bed-and-breakfast and other forms of temporary accommodation. The Government must set out an emergency programme for enacting and achieving those targets. We have already said that we need urgently to enact the Bill that deals with houses in multiple occupation and several issues related to the private rented sector, which my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) outlined, and which have been set out in the Brent private rented sector housing survey. The Government should also introduce legislation to remove rent rebates from housing revenue accounts of local authorities to enable the full introduction of resource accounting. Local authorities' housing targets need to be put on a statutory basis. If we are to achieve an increase in affordable housing, we must give local authorities full powers and make it mandatory within their housing strategies so that they can work effectively in partnership with registered social landlords in their areas and the private rented sector to carry out the full range of duties in relation to all aspects of housing provision. That will require a strengthening of the obligations placed on RSLs and other housing providers to assist local authorities to meet their housing duties. That will be all the more important because, by 2004, more than 50 per cent. of all social housing will be managed and owned by residential social landlords. The strategic role of local authorities needs to be put more firmly on a statutory basis. I make a final plea for the self-build movement, which makes a small but significant contribution to tackling the enormity of the housing problem that many of us experience. It is a movement that I espoused in my former life as leader of Lewisham council. In those small in-fill areas where we have a desperate shortage of land, such as in my constituency, self-build housing can be of moderate assistance in tackling the problem. We must re-examine the way in which the funding rules of housing corporations apply, so that we can enable unemployed and young people to build their own homes, thus providing them with a roof over their heads and empowering and training them. That is in the spirit of the Government's policy of regeneration and neighbourhood renewal.",36705,[],Housing,0,107,housing,1559

Members have mentioned has come down to increased investment in both the public and private sectors. Other hon. Members mentioned that, and I hope that the Minister will respond to the point. Renovation grants in the private sector are vital for improving the housing stock. That applies not only to the north of England, but to all hon. Members' constituencies. Lack of local funds is at the heart of the problem. Few councils offer renovation grants because of constraints on local government finance. The debate has been wide-ranging and I wish to give the Minister as much time as possible to respond, although I know that she will not be able to cover all our points.

Friends the Members for Billericay (Mr. Baron), for Bexhill and Battle (Mr. Barker) and for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) for their excellent speeches that related, pertinently, to the Government's targets for housing in their areas. I have to say to the Minister-I hope in a non-partisan manner-that we cannot continue to build on our greenfield sites at the rate that those targets suggest. After we have built over the sites, we cannot get them back. Pertinent points have also been made about building on brownfield sites. Yesterday, I was in Ipswich where the council is inhibiting a major development on a brownfield site because it will not allow a new road to be built although it has received private finance and will not cost the taxpayer a penny. Such political dogma against the car is unacceptable. We ask the Government to ensure that we meet brownfield housing targets. I am a chartered surveyor-that is a registered interest-and I endorse the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle. We need well-designed social housing. We know the mistakes that were made in the 1960s, and some housing that was built then must be pulled down because the designs are so bad. I remember visiting a block of flats in Glasgow with a Select Committee. A poor woman on housing benefit was paying Â£20 a week for her electricity bill and, during the winter, the flat was colder inside than outside. The hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) mentioned investment. That is what this problem is all about. If we do not have investment, we will not get the quantity of social housing units that we want. The Chartered Institute of Housing calculated that the Government must transfer a further 1 million homes in order to meet their 10-year renovation target. That represents a critical sum of money, and the money that is generated from stock transfers will depend on the rent strategy. There is little point in trying artificially to hold down rents in the private sector, and then complaining that the private sector produces insufficient housing units. One of the comments made by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) caught my attention. He seemed to suggest that no urban regeneration occurred under the last Conservative Administration. That is absolute nonsense. We saw excellent regeneration in areas such as Docklands and the centres of Glasgow and Leeds.",36705,[],Housing,0,110,housing,407

That has been a priority for this Government, and rightly so. The hon. Gentleman talked about the problem of homelessness, which is a blight on any civilised society. Our priority should be to house the homeless and to ensure that they have the necessary support so that they do not become homeless again.

2001-11-15,Housing,534,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"No, I have said that I will not give way. The hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) presented the Liberal Democrats' wish list. That may be want they want, but it would be the economics of utter madness. He said how awful it was for homeless people, and suggested using all the empty houses for them. For the reasons that my hon. Friends have set out, I reject the idea of simply matching up homeless people and empty houses. The hon. Gentleman mentioned building council housing and subsidising rents, but there is more to a good housing policy than just the building of houses and the paying of rents. Of course we must deal with those issues, but a host of others must also be addressed, such as those raised by my hon. Friends. I shall quickly go through the issues, and then try to respond to them in turn. I shall write to hon. Members about any points that I cannot deal with. Hon. Members referred to affordable housing, bed and breakfast and homelessness, empty homes, houses in multiple occupation, housing allocations and time scales for acceptance, finance for homelessness, issues raised by Shelter, working with the Housing Corporation, skills shortages, women and black and ethnic minority communities and building, problems of housing in London, the detailed workings of the Children Act 1989, overcrowding regulations, health and children in bed and breakfast, the private rented sector, rent restructuring, housing benefit reform, affordable housing and commercial development, low demand, the Secretary of State's statement about housing finance, the Bolton model, securitisation, the need to link housing to wider regeneration, the need to deal with racial disadvantage in housing and private sector renewal. That long list shows the complexity of the issues surrounding housing. We need detailed policies to deal with all those problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) raised the issue of planning and affordable housing. He is absolutely right. The planning system helps to provide better housing and better communities. He was also right to highlight the importance of dealing with empty homes. We need a range of strategies to deal with the different types of empty homes and what has caused them to be empty. He also spoke about houses in multiple occupation. My officials have been working closely with my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner) on his Home Energy Conservation Bill. We welcome the fact that it has helped to push the problems of houses in multiple occupation right up the political agenda. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) talked about time scales for responses. The Homelessness Bill says that local authorities must act reasonably. Reasonableness is open to many interpretations, but it provides local authorities with the flexibility that they need. Clearly, if they do not act reasonably, they can be challenged through the courts. She also mentioned the impact of recent court cases on social services obligations under the Children Act 1989. We are currently looking into that and it has been the subject of extensive discussions. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow also raised the issue of finance for homelessness. We have provided Â£8 million. Obviously we shall see the extent of that as new categories come into the ranks of the homeless. It would be as wrong to exclude 16 and 17-year-olds from qualifying for housing as it would to exclude care leavers or other vulnerable groups. She also referred to Shelter. I have had meetings with the chair of the Housing Corporation and the Department, and Housing Corporation officials are working closely with us to ensure that we provide a seamless service for the general public. My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) was right to raise the issue of skills shortages. In some parts of the country, particularly the north-west, the biggest barrier to housing renewal and regeneration in inner city areas is a shortage not of Government funds but of skilled labour. She was right to highlight the particular shortage of women entering the construction industry. Women represent only 9 per cent. of the work force in the building industry, and only 2 per cent. come from black and minority ethnic groups. The Government are working through the "" rethinking construction"" programme to tackle some of those issues. Clearly we are missing out on a huge range of the population who could help us to overcome that skills shortage. My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) talked about the need to examine closely the concentrations of disadvantage in otherwise affluent areas-which we are doing-to ensure that the housing problems of those communities are addressed. She said that there was a need for a sure start scheme for children in temporary accommodation. We are considering producing guidance to deal with some of the health problems of children in bed and breakfast. I take her point that those children are some of the most needy and vulnerable. She also clearly set out why we must examine the problems of overcrowding. I completely endorse the remarks of my hon.

2003-10-29,Housing,427,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this important issue. Many Members have shown a great deal of interest in this Adjournment debate, including my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) who first suggested calling it. Overcrowding is the forgotten issue in housing policy. Because it is so difficult, perhaps it has not been so much forgotten as put on the back burner, where it has remained since 1935, when the standards were first introduced. The point of this Adjournment debate is to set out how disastrous the standards are and how they can be improved, and to press for their improvement as part of any housing legislation introduced in the near future. The number of families in statutorily overcrowded conditions is not known, because the figures are not collected. London Housing states that 150,000 households are overcrowded, but its definition is not exactly the same as statutory overcrowding. In the introduction to his Housing (Overcrowding) Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) referred to the survey of English housing, which states that 500,000 households nationally are overcrowded-but again, the definition is not necessarily the same as that for statutory overcrowding. The actual number of statutorily overcrowded families is likely to be minimal, because the standards are so abysmally low that it is hard to breach them. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) and I have examined housing in her constituency. Although many of the families whom we met on that visit live in overcrowded conditions, when I counted up the people and the rooms, none of them was statutorily overcrowded. However, my hon. Friend knows of a number of cases of statutory overcrowding. Many of us have been involved with housing over the years both as councillors and as MPs, and all the evidence, and the experience of those of us who have been involved with housing on a professional or a casework level, points to three things. First, overcrowded households include families with children. That may sound obvious, but it is worth emphasising that the issue concerns not only housing policy but policy for children. By and large, overcrowding does not affect single-person households. Secondly, the problem disproportionately affects people from ethnic minority communities. Some communities are affected more than others. In particular, the Bangladeshi community in Tower Hamlets, on which Shelter has produced an excellent report, is seriously affected by overcrowding. Thirdly, overcrowding is a problem for young families with one or two children who are trapped in one-bedroom flats in excruciating circumstances-something that I see a lot in my constituency. Overcrowding is often seen as a big city problem, but that is not the case. In my middle England constituency, I come across the problem too often. For example, I know of a Bangladeshi woman with six children who lives in a little terraced house. She has created six bedrooms in her house by making haphazard subdivisions. She shares one small room with her baby, her 15-year-old daughter lives in another tiny room, her four other children sleep in a third room, another couple and one of their children share a fourth room, that couple's other three children, one of whom has special needs, sleep in another room, and a single man sleeps in an attic room. Last weekend I visited a family who live in a one-bedroom first floor flat. The young woman, her husband and their two-year-old son share a bedroom. The daughter, who is about 10 years older, has serious special needs and sleeps in the sitting room. The sitting room is full of containers of clothes, baby items and toys. Both families have serious problems as a result of their overcrowded conditions, but neither is statutorily overcrowded. Neither has any hope of moving. It is hard to overestimate the profound sense of injustice that overcrowded housing conditions can create in people. There is complete fury when people are told that they should relieve the pressure on the bedroom by putting a bed in the kitchen, or when they are told that they can meet the requirements for gender segregation if the wife sleeps in the same room as the daughter and the husband shares a room with the sons.",41863,[],Housing,0,1,housing,713
2003-10-29,Housing,428,Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,Con,False,We can all come up with terrible examples of overcrowding. Would not a really good outcome of the debate be for the Minister to give a direction under the Homelessness Act 2002 that when local authorities carry out their homelessness plan they should also inquire into the exact amount of overcrowding in their area?,41863,[],Housing,0,2,housing,54
2003-10-29,Housing,429,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"I shall come to some ways forward at the end of my remarks. I said at the beginning that the problem is very difficult to solve. There must be careful thought about how we progress. One real difficulty with overcrowding is that in none of those cases are the families statutorily overcrowded. If a survey were done of statutory overcrowding, the horror stories that everyone could tell would not show up, because the families are not statutorily overcrowded according to the present rules. We must review the standards and set new ones that would have been more appropriate even in 1935, let alone today. We must also consider how the Government work with local authorities to map out the extent of overcrowding and to determine how to catch the small but acutely disadvantaged group of people who live in unacceptable conditions. One could argue that people who are overcrowded should simply be regarded as homeless. That would create a catch-all, but no clear framework for solving the problem. I shall come on to some solutions later. It is important that proposals are put forward in this debate that can be picked up and implemented by the Government to ensure that we end what has been a complete scandal for many years. The sense of injustice felt by people who live in such circumstances is increased when they see homeless families get two or three-bedroom houses. Most local authorities use more generous space standards for housing allocations, but overcrowded families do not score highly on points systems for transfers. Overcrowding is often a problem for growing families who become trapped because they cannot get transfers, or because adult children who cannot get housing remain with their parents and have children of their own. Two or three families may live in one house. One way out is for families to make themselves homeless, and some end up doing just that. It is hard to overestimate the damage caused by overcrowding. It is an area on which the different aspects of Government policy are not joined up properly. Children cannot do their homework if the sitting room is a bedroom and there is no space to study. The consequences for health can also be dire. The British Medical Association's head of science and ethics has said that "" poor housing can cause psychological and physical health problems, and the best way to reduce health inequalities in this country is to improve living standards."" There are also risks to children's safety and well-being as the result of inappropriate sharing of bedrooms and the resulting lack of privacy. The Government are making real progress in developing good children's policies and putting them into effect, but for some families, overcrowded housing is a barrier to child health, educational achievement and freedom from abuse. There is nothing new about the criticisms of overcrowding standards. I invite Members to consider this statement: "" the right hon. Gentleman's standards as regards overcrowding are not standards which are tolerable in the twentieth century. He contemplates as a normal thing that living rooms should be used as bedrooms. I can never agree to that. I think it is wrong.""- Here is another one: "" it would be much preferable to establish a standard which hon. Members can defend in the country, even if we give a time limit to local authorities, rather than hang around the necks of hon. Members and local authorities a standard of overcrowding of which this country will be ashamed within the next two years.""- Those criticisms of the overcrowding standards were made when the Housing Bill was on Report in 1935-the year that the standards were first introduced. It was expected that they would be upgraded in future years. It is interesting to note that those standards were introduced by a Health Minister, because of the link between housing standards and health. The amendment tabled in 1935 was radical, because it proposed to disregard the living room in the calculation of standards. It was recognised that the standards were deliberately set low in order to prevent the building of a whole swathe of extra houses. That really is the rub. As the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) pointed out, the question is not whether, but how, the standards should be changed, My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton set out a gold standard in his Bill, which has been very important, as has the report of the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing Planning and Local Government, and the excellent work of Shelter.",41863,[],Housing,0,3,housing,763
2003-10-29,Housing,430,Andrew Love,Lab,False,"I thank my hon. Friend for her kind remarks. She will be aware that the standards in my Bill were based on those set in the English housing conditions survey, which is, by unanimous acclaim, a modest overcrowding standard. To have a gold standard, we would be considering something significantly better than the standard in my Bill.",41863,[],Housing,0,4,housing,57
2003-10-29,Housing,431,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"I take my hon. Friend's point. I was just trying to say that if his standards were enshrined in legislation, we would be doing extraordinarily well. Whatever happens, we must see some improvements on the present position. It is a scandal that the standards MPs said in 1935 that they would be ashamed of two years after their introduction are still in place almost 70 years later, and without the modest improvements that were proposed then, such as discounting the sitting room. My hon. Friend's standards would have been contained in primary legislation, but they should not be introduced there because they should be open to wide discussion. They should also be open to simpler amendment than primary legislation allows. Secondary legislation would provide for greater flexibility and allow us to improve standards without the problems that we have seen with past housing Bills, in which it has been difficult to change standards. There is a reluctance to commit too much to secondary legislation, but overcrowding standards are ideally suited to that form of settlement. It is important to have absolute standards. The issue is not about establishing when housing overcrowding becomes a risk, as in the housing health and safety rating system's proposed method of considering overcrowding standards, but about specifying what standards of space accord with wider policy objectives for children and families. It is also about our changed perceptions of space and privacy compared with those of 1935. For example, should it be recognised that husband and wife should not have to sleep in separate rooms to meet overcrowding standards? I certainly think that it should. It is very difficult to explain to older parents that they might have to sleep with their grown-up children rather than each other because of the gender segregation requirements. It should also be recognised that children under 10 count as people, not half-people. My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton says that the cut-off age should be five. We should recognise that families need a living room. They are entitled to some space-more if the family is large-to use for recreation, leisure, eating, doing homework and the like.",41863,[],Housing,0,5,housing,357
2003-10-29,Housing,432,Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,Con,False,"I agree with the broad thrust of what the hon. Lady is saying. Something must be done about the problems, but how should it be done? I slightly disagree with what she said about the provisions not being in primary legislation. It seems to me that the Housing Bill that the Government are about to introduce would provide an ideal opportunity to deal with the problem, and it would update the Housing Act 1985, which is nearly 20 years old. Standards have moved on considerably since then.",41863,[],Housing,0,6,housing,87
2003-10-29,Housing,433,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"It is a moot point where the provisions should be. I would just say that the Housing Acts passed after 1935 have always reinforced the previous standards. That is partly because there have been other priorities. Certainly, local authorities were applying different, more generous standards during the 1960s and 1970s. With all the changes taking place at that time, perhaps it did not seem quite so important to improve the statutory standards. Including those standards in legislation has made them very resistant to change. If it is not possible to get absolute agreement on the standards to be enshrined in the Bill, it might be more helpful to have secondary legislation so that there can be detailed attention to that particular aspect of housing. It is right that over time we should constantly improve the standard of housing and recognise that people should have more space for recreation. It would be nice if they had space for proper dining facilities, for example. It is also important that we understand that the changes that we introduce now would be subject to change in future years. We should make absolutely sure that we do not pass legislation now and then leave it for another 70 years before there is the opportunity to change something, just because we used primary rather than secondary legislation. We need to consider that risk carefully, but we must not say, "" We can't get agreement to change the wording in the Bill so we aren't going to do anything."" I suspect that that is what happened with previous Housing Acts. Probably the most difficult issue is that there needs to be a process of implementation, during which there would have to be careful assessment of the impact of changing standards and how the goals could be achieved. My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton also made the point about the need for a survey so that we can quantify the level of overcrowding and ensure that we know how that can be managed. Some of the issues involved in tackling overcrowding concern management of the housing stock, such as management policies for transfers, arrangements for housing homeless people, how we manage homelessness, and what we do about grown-up children with babies who are living with parents and grandparents. We also have to consider the design of new homes, including proper provision for larger families. One option that I do not believe is open is to leave the standards untouched. They are offensive, they cause immense hardships for families with children-the very families that other areas of Government policy are so keen to support-and discriminate unfairly against particular ethnic minority communities. They are also virtually impossible for people at the sharp end in the communities to challenge, because of the different ways in which the various pieces of housing legislation work. I hope that careful consideration will be given to that matter.",41863,[],Housing,0,7,housing,484

2003-10-29,Housing,435,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"I agree. It is clear that overcrowding is about child policy, not just housing and family policy. Overcrowding and economic disadvantage are related. Also, there is a failure to take into account the pressures on the most disadvantaged families. The case in my constituency that I cited, in which one of the children living in those circumstances had special needs, is typical of a number of families. A family with children with special needs often needs extra space to manage the equipment and the behavioural problems. I hope that such issues can be taken forward by a really careful consideration of, and improvement in, the overcrowding standards. I also hope that this subject will be covered in any forthcoming housing Bill, and that we will at last bring our overcrowding standards not just into the 20th century, but into the 21st century.",41863,[],Housing,0,9,housing,142
2003-10-29,Housing,436,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"May I draw Members' attention to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests? I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing this important debate. She has shown a great deal of interest and concern about the issue, and is to be congratulated on giving us an opportunity to discuss the matter again today. I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) on all the work that he has done in bringing the issue forward. Overcrowding is one of the most serious and pressing concerns for those of us representing constituencies facing a housing shortage. It has knock-on consequences for a number of the Government's agendas for tackling social exclusion, including agendas for health targets, educational achievements and antisocial behaviour. There are few areas of concern that the Government are rightly seeking to address, and into which they are putting resources, on which overcrowding does not have an impact. I have made my next point before when speaking on housing issues in this Chamber and in my constituency. Overcrowding is one of the most serious causes of racial tension-I am sure that some of my colleagues face racial tension issues-for the simple reason that, at a time when there has been a great deal of media and political interest in immigration and asylum, the chronic housing shortage and its consequences create a sense among many people living in unacceptable and appalling conditions that immigration and asylum seekers are to blame for their plight. I shall draw attention to why that view is not true. However, I have no doubt about the unfortunate consequences of the situation in terms of public policy. I hope that the contributions made today, and those that I am sure many of us will continue to make, can do something to get this terribly serious problem on to the Government's agenda. The problem with housing is that most people are either satisfactorily housed-thank goodness for that-or see housing as a market need. Many people who are buying their own houses will see their ability, or inability, to have the house that they want as a market transaction. Housing therefore simply does not get the same attention as education and the health service. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North and I have said, the impact of housing shortage where it is most acute is undermining so many of our attempts at progress on those other agendas. In an intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton drew attention to the particular issues in London. There are impacts on other cities and parts of the country, and there are pockets of serious rural overcrowding to which we could draw attention, but there is no doubt that this problem impacts specifically and detrimentally on the capital. In London, overcrowding is almost four times as frequent as outside it, and there was a 21 per cent. increase in overcrowding levels between the 1991 and 2001 censuses. When we bear in mind that the 2001 census in London, Manchester and a few other places was woefully inaccurate, that does nothing to give us confidence that we have found the real scale of the problem. It is probably a great deal worse than census data give us cause to believe. According to that data, which we shall have to use until we have any better, there has been a 21 per cent. increase in overcrowding levels in London compared with a 22 per cent. decline in the rest of the United Kingdom. I am extremely pleased about that decline, but we are grappling yet again with a serious regional imbalance. We are often stymied by the fact that we put forward policy solutions to a problem that are in danger of being dismissed because they have a particular regional impact. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister understands that those of us seeking to address this issue can do so only from the facts and experience of our own localities. The seriousness of the problem should not be masked by a national set of averages that, if examined, show that the rest of the country has enjoyed a decline in overcrowding levels in recent years. The two boroughs in my constituency are among the worst affected in terms of increases in overcrowding. There has been a near doubling of overcrowding among tenants of registered social landlords in Kensington and Chelsea, and the amount of council stock deemed to be overcrowded has increased from 9 to 14 per cent. in Kensington and Chelsea and from 8 to 12 per cent. in Westminster. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North said, we have to remember what those statistics represent: absolute human tragedies. Mrs C has two children, one with autism and one with heart disease. Their school has advised me that "" at the moment, their living conditions are severely hampering not only their social, but also their mental and physical development"". Another constituent wrote to me recently to say: "" My parents have allowed my family to temporarily stay in their property and as a result I share a 3 bedroom flat with 9 people ... I occupy one small bedroom and share a double bed with my husband and 4 year old son, my two year old occupies a cot and frequently wakes in the night, disturbing everyone. My father is a pensioner with Parkinson's disease, depression, hypertension and bladder problems ... my mother is also a pensioner ... Two of my brothers are in full-time education and attempting to study for examinations."" A third constituent, Mrs. S, writes: "" I stressed all the support sent from my GP, Social Worker and from you regarding my health. My physical and mental state is seriously deteriorating. I am sinking into a deep depression as I battle with my housing situation daily. I am at breaking point! And the children are suffering too. Yes I now have constant heating and hot water"", for which she is grateful, "" but there are still the problems of the flights of stairs, lifting, carrying and climbing for four people sleeping in the one bedroom. No space for the children to play is made more apparent as the baby is very mobile now. The noise in the flat is worsened by the fact that there is no soundproofing. I cannot take any more. I am desperate and very vulnerable at this time."" As my hon. Friend said, even people suffering from such levels of overcrowding cannot for the most part become registered as statutorily overcrowded under the present legislation. As we have heard, children under one year of age do not count, despite the fact that they take up sleeping room and become mobile as they begin to crawl. Children under 10 count as a half. I referred the family of a Mrs. M to the environmental health office for an assessment, but the reply that I received stated: "" The ages of the children mean that the family currently has 4.5 'persons' in that the 3 younger children each currently count as 0.5 of a person."" I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will understand that when constituents receive a letter telling them that a nine-year-old child counts as only half a person, it causes them great irritation. The child in question may be, as in the case of my constituents, aged nine and a half with special educational needs. Three of the family's four children have special educational needs relating to language and speech development disorders, which are not counted for the purpose of overcrowding. The rules make it impossible to compound either many different levels of medical need-because medical points are allocated for only one person in a household-or the impact of overcrowding on the family's medical problems. The result is that they cannot secure statutory overcrowding points. My hon. Friend rightly drew attention to the fact that under the 1935 legislation housing authorities are allowed to require the living room to be used as sleeping accommodation, regardless of the impact that that would have on the family's social life or privacy, or on children's ability to get a proper night's sleep or to study. However, things are slightly worse than that, because under legislation there have been instances when it has been decided that the kitchen could be used for sleeping. A reply to a letter inquiring about a constituent stated that the lounge and two bedrooms were clearly included as sleeping accommodation, but that the difficulty for the environmental health department was whether to use the kitchen-diner as a living room, since there were a table and chairs in the room and it therefore seemed to be used for more than just cooking. It is possible for an environmental health department to decide that if a kitchen-diner is used for eating, it can therefore be used for sleeping. I would not know, because the information is not monitored across the board, in how many instances such a ruling has been made. The problem is that even if a family can get through the equivalent of the biblical eye of the needle and qualify as statutorily overcrowded, they still cannot move, because of the shortage of accommodation. The family of Mr. A in my constituency is statutorily overcrowded and has received the maximum additional points that are available. There are seven people in a two-bedroom flat, and they have medical points because the gentleman in the family has ischaemic heart disease. The family have not been allowed to move and are still 11th on the housing waiting list, having been on it with maximum points for about four years. A letter from the sure start unit in the ward where the family lives states: "" I do not understand why the family has not been able to move ... the family are statutorily overcrowded with 2 adults and three children""- it is in fact four children- in a one-bed flat ... the family is surviving in the most distressingly cramped conditions ... Charlie ... aged 11 years, and Faith, aged 5 go to sleep in their parents' bed and then, when they are ready for bed, the parents transfer them to a sofa bed in the lounge room ... the two youngest children sleep in a cot beside their parents' bed ... "" The mother "" is one of the main supports for her mother in law who lives nearby ... who has cancer"". There are therefore good reasons for the family not to welcome a letter from the local authority asking whether they would be interested in being considered for a move to the north of England. Another family, living in north Kensington and statutorily overcrowded in a housing association property, are a couple with four children over three years old. They live in a one-bedroom flat. I asked the environmental health department to assess the flat for overcrowding. Its view was: "" The recognition of statutory overcrowding will not provide an early offer of permanent local housing."" I was informed that the head of housing needs in the borough-who is an excellent housing officer and has been of enormous practical help to me over the years-has none the less advised in this instance that "" there are many hundreds of families with similar overcrowding currently registered for larger accommodation on the Council's Housing register.""",41863,[],Housing,0,10,housing,1911
2003-10-29,Housing,437,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"Perhaps the Minister could confirm my understanding that if people are statutorily overcrowded and register with the local authority for a transfer, the matter ends there. Priority is granted, but there is no automatic right to rehousing as one might normally expect following a breach of a statutory standard. Once people apply for housing, they lose their immediate rights and the obligation to rehouse them ends.",41863,[],Housing,0,11,housing,66
2003-10-29,Housing,438,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend is right. In some ways, it is worse than that. Her point leads me to my next sentence. Last year, the chief housing officer for the housing association wrote to me as follows: "" It would not be in your constituents' interest if enforcement action was taken in respect of statutory overcrowding as this would require us to evict the family for breaching the covenant requiring them not to overcrowd the dwelling."" According to statutory overcrowding legislation, it is the tenants' fault that they are overcrowded. In my experience, private tenants and tenants housed by registered social landlords and local authorities are often technically in breach of their housing obligations if they are overcrowded. They are therefore the ones who are at fault, and they can be evicted. In practice, that does not happen, especially where children are involved. In this instance, however, the housing association's comment flags up a particular problem. There is a serious and worsening crisis, especially in London. Given the nature of the legislation, it is extremely difficult for families to qualify as being statutorily overcrowded. When they do, it is almost impossible to move them. In many cases, families are told that their only option is to consider moving to the north of England. Some would welcome that, and I assure hon. Members that I have nothing against the north of England in this respect. However, many-probably the overwhelming majority-of these families have extremely strong local ties. Many of them are working, despite the conditions in which they live, and many are from minority ethnic communities with strong community links. Many, such as the family with the three children with special needs in language development, have strong ties with the health service and schools, which provide them with vital support for their children. Uprooting such families and moving them to another part of the country is simply not an option. If we are to deal with the problem of overcrowding, we must treat it as important, monitor it and set targets. It is right that families living in substandard housing should be a target in the monitoring of child poverty. Defining homelessness and overcrowding as forms of housing need and as targets in tackling child poverty is also well overdue. If we do not commit ourselves to updating the legislation and to monitoring the impact of overcrowding and the problems arising from it, the issue will continue to stay below the radar. I join my hon. Friends in asking the Minister to reconsider the matter and to pursue it. It is not satisfactory simply to wrap up the problem by using the standards that the Government propose. A few months ago, the Minister's colleague wrote that "" to raise the issue of overcrowding standards in isolation from other factors would not deal with the problem"". I suggest that if we do not raise these issues, and deal with them, the hard core of chronically overcrowded families will simply be ignored, and they will continue not to receive the attention that they deserve. Will the Minister also undertake to consider the role of registered social landlords? Housing associations are increasingly becoming the primary providers of social housing, and we are finding that they have different standards in relation to overcrowding. I have seen many cases in which families in overcrowded accommodation finally receive their one chance of an offer. Their case is made to the housing association, but they are rejected because the association says that they are overcrowding the accommodation. For example, the association will not consider housing more than six people in a three-bedroom property. That means that a family with seven or eight members in the worst housing need, with no prospect of receiving an offer of four-bedroom accommodation, is least likely to receive an offer because of the way in which the RSLs operate their own overcrowding standards. Obviously, we do not want to overcrowd accommodation more than we need to, but we must recognise that it is unacceptable to leave a certain cohort of households, which are in a chronic condition, at the back of the queue because of the way in which housing association rules work. I now return to my opening point about some of the tensions, particularly racial tensions, arising out of the housing shortage. We must recognise that stock shortage is at the heart of that problem. There has not been a massive increase in the number of families who have presented themselves as being homeless and come through the homelessness route. The heart of the overcrowding problem is not London's rising population, but the decline of housing stock over the past 10 or 20 years. A recent parliamentary question about the total social landlord dwelling stock in England and Wales showed that the number of properties available for rent in London has fallen by 23,000 since 1997. If those 23,000 units had been available to us, we would have been able to relieve a great deal of overcrowding and homelessness. Part of the problem is that Housing Corporation rules make it impossible for larger properties to be built in high-value areas such as London. We desperately need to procure and purchase four and five-bedroom accommodation to deal with larger families who are not offered three-bedroom accommodation. Although that would lessen overcrowding, they are turned away. We cannot produce that stock because of Housing Corporation rules and the way in which capital finance works. It is time to grasp the nettle. The situation is intolerable for tens of thousands of overcrowded London residents, particularly those at the sharp edge, who are close to statutory overcrowding limits, or just over them. I hope that the Minister will raise these issues with the Department. I hope also that she will make the case for updating legislation, and for some of the rule changes and resources that are necessary to relieve the problem.",41863,[],Housing,0,12,housing,986

2003-10-29,Housing,440,Kerry Pollard,Lab,False,"I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing this important debate. Most of us believe that the provision of secure, well-founded and affordable housing is one of the most important issues with which we must deal. It is particularly critical in the east and the south-east. Overcrowding is a big issue. In my constituency, some extended families use overcrowding to move up the waiting list. Parents give their children, who often have a child of their own, notice to quit, which leaves the young family homeless, and therefore a higher priority than an overcrowded household. That shows that there is a lack of affordable housing. It does not matter how housing is allocated if the supply is insufficient to meet demand. This year, my area was fortunate enough to receive the highest allocation in the region: Â£18.2 million. It is one of the most expensive areas in the country for land prices and building costs, and there is a lack of skilled workers, but we are doing some good things. One of our more innovative schemes is due to be completed soon; I hope to persuade the Minister to cut the ribbon. It is for 52 two-bedroomed flats on a former electricity site, 40 per cent. of which are for key workers. No public subsidy has gone into the scheme. The flats will be kept for rent in perpetuity so that successive tenants can enjoy the advantage of an affordable home. We recently granted planning permission for a mixed development on an old Territorial Army site, 35 per cent. of which will be affordable homes for rent. We are also developing small sites and lumping several together so that they can benefit from the economies of scale that normally accrue to large sites. I am also trying to persuade the local council and our local population that some of the land on an old aerodrome site of 300-plus acres, which was mined for gravel, should be allocated for housing, even though it is technically green belt. That land is also the subject of some speculation about the provision of a rail freight terminal: a 24-hour-a-day, 365-day-a-year operation. It seems to me that a few hundred houses, a bypass to the local village and some formed woodland would be a better option. I want to raise two other issues, the first of which concerns empty homes. It is estimated that 750,000 homes are empty, with more than 80 per cent. in the private sector. Houses next to empty homes can suffer devaluation by as much as 10 to 20 per cent. according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 gives the right to order disposal of empty public property. That process involves a public request ordering disposal. As more than 80 per cent. of empty homes are in the private sector and not covered by the Act, now is perhaps the time to include them. Private owners served with a PROD could use the property themselves, let it, sell it or provide a justifiable reason-such as a planning reason-why it needs to stay empty. Even if only one quarter of empty homes were brought into use, that would equate to 180,000 extra homes. The second issue is VAT on refurbished homes. VAT on new buildings is zero, yet on refurbished homes it is 17.5 per cent. We all know of homes that could be refurbished, but which it might be cheaper to knock down and rebuild because of the VAT. Many of us have been putting that argument for some years without any sign that it is understood or listened to by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Regeneration is rightly given a high priority by the Government. That would be greatly helped by the scrapping of VAT on refurbishment. Overcrowding is a symptom of housing under stress. I welcome the Government's plans for major house building in certain areas. However, I would plead that cities, such as St. Albans where the housing need is as great as anywhere in the country, continue to receive substantial grants for new affordable homes.",41863,[],Housing,0,14,housing,697
2003-10-29,Housing,441,Oona King,Lab,False,"I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing the debate. As a councillor, as an MP and as a Minister she has shown real commitment to helping families who live in overcrowded conditions. During her time as Minister, she visited the Boundary estate in Bethnal Green and listened to the experiences of a number of families living in overcrowded homes-families in which three or even four children shared a single bedroom; or families in which parents or siblings slept in the living room every single night. The health, well-being, educational attainment and employment prospects of those families-in other words, their entire future-are blighted because their homes too small. The survey of English housing estimates that there are more than 17,000 overcrowded households in London. In Tower Hamlets, we have approximately 8,000 overcrowded households. That is the most severe level of overcrowding in the country, and is accompanied-unsurprisingly, as there is a direct link between the two-by the highest density of poverty in the country. The vast majority of those overcrowded households are young families with two or three children waiting for a family-sized home to become available. Unfortunately, as my constituents know to their great cost, they have to wait for an unacceptably long time. Some have already waited more than 10 years. Some have waited for almost 20 years. I am sorry, but I will do what other MPs have done and illustrate the problem by referring to families with whom I come into contact. That is because it is so difficult to portray the level of human suffering involved. I am not using the worst cases; I usually use the worst examples, but I thought that this time I would go for the averagely bad. Mrs. A lives in a small two-bedroom flat with her husband and four children. There is not enough room for all the children to have separate beds, and the boys and girls have to share a room. Mrs. B also lives in a small two-bedroom flat. Mr. B is elderly and disabled, and lives with his disabled wife, adult son, adult daughter and baby grandson. Once again, there is not enough room for everyone to have a bed, and there is not enough room for facilities to deal with Mr. and Mrs. B's disabilities. There is obviously no privacy for the adult son and daughter. Predictably, both those tenants have come to me asking for help to get the one available vacant house in their area. At least one of them will be disappointed; from my experience both of them are likely to be disappointed. Mr. C lives with his wife and two children, aged five and two, in a one-bedroom flat on a high floor of a tower block. A third child is expected in three months. There is insufficient room for the existing children to have a bed each, and it is difficult to see how space could be made for a cot for the third child. I took a former Minister with responsibility for housing to a property in Tower Hamlets where an extended family of 16 people were living in two bedrooms-and I am sorry to report to my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North that none of the families that we visited have yet been rehoused in larger, family-sized accommodation.",41863,[],Housing,0,15,housing,559
2003-10-29,Housing,442,Andrew Love,Lab,False,"Is not the important point that none of those cases counts as statutorily overcrowded? That shows just how completely out of date the system is, as it cannot deal with modern circumstances.",41863,[],Housing,0,16,housing,32
2003-10-29,Housing,443,Oona King,Lab,False,"That is precisely the point. The accommodation of the last family that I mentioned, with 16 people in two bedrooms, is of course regarded as statutorily overcrowded, and another family on the Tower Hamlets waiting list who require five bedrooms also currently live in accommodation that is classed as statutorily overcrowded. However, my hon. Friend is exactly right: all the other cases that I have mentioned do not count as statutorily overcrowded. I am sure that the lack of progress is one of the reasons why my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North initiated a review of the current statutory definition of overcrowding. As has already been said, the definition ignores babies and expects living rooms to be permanently available for people to sleep in. For the benefit of my hon. Friends, I should add that 70 years ago, the Labour party described those very same standards as intolerable in the 20th century, and a Labour Member of Parliament said that this House "" ought not to let it go forth that we regard it as a satisfactory state of affairs that people should normally have to sleep in living rooms.""- That was 1935, yet the same standards are still with us. The review of those standards that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North initiated gave hope to overcrowded families in Tower Hamlets that the Government were turning their attention to their needs. However, after she moved on to the Department for International Development, no progress was made with that review. Since then, we have been told that overcrowding will be addressed through the new housing health and safety rating system. Unfortunately, the HHSRS cannot provide that review, not only because the number of hazards due to overcrowding and a lack of space are likely to be dwarfed by the number due to factors such as fire risk, damp and cold, but because the HHSRS inevitably involves a subjective assessment of conditions in a property. I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but the only objective yardstick against which environmental health officers can measure hazards that arise from overcrowding and lack of space is the room and space standards in the current statutory definition-the very same definition that the Minister with responsibility for housing described as outdated. That is why I hope that the Minister will follow her predecessor's lead and signal that she is prepared to consider updating that definition, as that would give hope to families in my constituency. The Housing (Overcrowding) Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) does not give overcrowded families the right to insist that they are prioritised for rehousing ahead of homeless families, yet the fear that that might happen has delayed the Government's movement. A remedy of that nature is specifically excluded from the Bill, because it is recognised that it might have unacceptable outcomes. However, local authorities already accept that such families have a right to a larger home, and in so doing they apply higher overcrowding standards than the statutory minimum. All that we are asking, therefore, is that the Government recognise that standard in law. A modernised statutory definition will not add to the burdens on local authorities, but will help us to see more clearly what the problem is and where it exists. If I thought that we could solve the problem of overcrowding with current or predicted resources, I would be less concerned about updating the statutory definition. However, despite the fantastic increases in Government investment in housing, we are still nowhere near doing that. Tackling overcrowding does not yet have the priority that it deserves. We are making huge investments: over the next three years we shall increase the total housing resource to Â£11 billion, we are on target to reduce the number of non-decent social homes by 1 million by 2004, and, through the transfer options, we are unlocking huge amounts of investment in social housing. I congratulate the Government on that. Tower Hamlets has had a welcome and much-needed 300 per cent. increase in investment in social housing, but it needs more. I suggest to the Minister that the forthcoming housing Bill offers the chance to give decision makers an incentive to move overcrowding up the agenda. Across southern England, updating the standards would help to energise our campaign to end child poverty. Let us not forget that 48 per cent. of this country's children in poverty live in inner London. I know that many in the rest of the country do not believe that-they think that all the streets are paved with gold-but it is a fact. If we are to meet the Government's target of dealing with child poverty, we have to tackle one of the biggest issues that faces those children-overcrowding. It has to be moved up the agenda. That would help black and Asian families, who are seven times more likely to experience overcrowding than their white counterparts. Once one has faced up to a problem, one can begin to tackle it, and retaining a statutory definition that is so outdated and so rarely breached only helps us to convince ourselves that overcrowding is not a problem and does not need to he tackled. We need to set a new threshold-a gold standard-to aim for. The bedroom standard used in the survey of English housing is that standard, and the forthcoming housing Bill will provide the perfect opportunity to put it on the statute book. I shall briefly offer some solutions. Admitting the scale of overcrowding is the first step in tackling it. The next is building affordable homes in the numbers that are needed. I have argued previously that the only way to tackle the housing crisis is to double our output of affordable homes. That would mean doubling our investment again, and I know that the money cannot be found immediately, so I suggest helping to generate an immediate increase in the number of council and housing association lettings. We need some short-term emergency measures to free up family-sized accommodation for families suffering severe overcrowding. During a debate in June, I suggested an expansion of the seaside and country homes scheme. In the Minister's reply, he told me that Housing Organisation and Exchange Mobility Services, which manages the scheme, has begun working with Girlings Retirement Options to give elderly people further options. I would be grateful for details as to how that has progressed. Since the local restriction of right to buy, cash incentive schemes have become really popular in Tower Hamlets, with the result that more tenancies, including four four-bedroom tenancies this year, have been returned to the council to be re-let. A cash incentive is a cheap and efficient way to help tenants of social housing to become home owners. It empowers tenants by giving them choice over the size of their new homes. Please may we have more? The money for that has been cut, and although Tower Hamlets has subsidised it, we need it to be increased. My last point concerns occupation. As well as there being many people who want to leave London, we have the advantage that a surprisingly high number live in homes that are not fully occupied. In London, 28 per cent. of council and registered social landlords' stock is officially under-occupied. The present incentive-between Â£500 and Â£1,000 for each bedroom-is not adequate; we need to increase it if we are to get people out of those properties. I should be grateful if the Minister would write to me on the points that I have drawn to her attention. We desperately need to tackle the terrible problem of overcrowding now.",41863,[],Housing,0,17,housing,1283
2003-10-29,Housing,444,Matthew Green,LibDem,False,"I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on having secured the debate. It is very timely in view of the forthcoming housing Bill, which will, as has been said, present a good opportunity to make changes. I shall avoid covering much of the ground that the hon. Members for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), for Edmonton (Mr. Love), for St. Albans (Mr. Pollard) and for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) have covered, because they have given excellent examples from their constituencies. I cannot do that: while we have a severe shortage of affordable housing in Ludlow, overcrowding is not as great a problem as it is in London. Let us consider the extent of it. About 500,000 households in the United Kingdom would be regarded as overcrowded if we adopted the bedroom standard. That is a significant number; it is about 3 per cent. of all households in the UK. In London, the figure is about 6 per cent. As we heard from the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, the percentage is much higher among ethnic minorities. I understand that, by that definition, up to 30 per cent. of Bangladeshi households would he overcrowded. None of us can regard that as acceptable in the 21st century. We have heard, rightly, about the effects of overcrowding, particularly those on health. The transmission of respiratory and infectious diseases and the increase in mortality and death rates are closely related to overcrowding. It is always connected with the spread of infectious diseases, either through the air or by physical contact. Measles, mumps, chicken pox, diphtheria and most respiratory conditions are more easily spread in overcrowded conditions, as are those that are spread by physical contact such as scabies. Longitudinal studies show that overcrowded housing dramatically increases the odds that young children will develop severe ill health in later life. We know, too, about the emotional effect on families. There is good evidence that it causes developmental delays in babies and young children. The stress of sharing bedrooms leads to tension and an increase in the breakdown of family relationships. That can result in an increase in homelessness among the teenage children of families in overcrowded homes. Overcrowding contributes to homelessness; it does not compete with it. It also has a large impact on education. If children do not have quiet space in which to do homework and their sleep is often interrupted, they are less able to concentrate at school. They then perform badly, and have behavioural problems. Consequently, their educational attainment suffers by comparison with that of children who are not from overcrowded homes. The problem is clear, well known and well documented, and it is growing. Why has it reached this point? Overcrowding was, by most measures, in decline until the early 1990s. It is linked to a reduction in the availability of affordable housing of all types, which happened because the right-to-buy policy decimated the council housing stock and also, where there were preserved rights, that of registered social landlords. Perhaps more worryingly for the Government, the number of new social houses built has declined since 1997. The housing and planning research centre estimates that between 83,000 and 99,000 affordable homes need to be built every year in order to meet demand. Even if we add together Housing Corporation-approved development grant, the effect of the transitional arrangement on the local authority social housing grant and houses from planning gain, about 50,000 homes will be built in the next 12 months, which will meet half of the estimated need. The shortfall will be at least 33,000 homes and will probably be more like 50,000 homes. Those are the problems. What are their solutions? All hon. Members who have spoken have rightly said that the housing Bill is an excellent opportunity to introduce a modern statutory definition of overcrowding such as that outlined in the Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Edmonton. If I have the privilege of serving on the Committee that considers the housing Bill, I will try to ensure that such a definition is brought forward. I understand that Ministers have some difficulties with a new definition. The Minister for Housing and Planning has said that the definition cannot be modernised in the housing Bill because such matters "" cannot be raised in isolation from other factors. Some of the current proposals would have the effect of imposing a quite unrealistic demand on the resources of the local authorities and diverting them from the excellent decent homes programme and their responsibilities to homeless families, who often live in far worse conditions than overcrowded households.""- I have some sympathy with his views. There is a way to deal with the problem. We could put a definition in the Bill with a sunrise clause stating the number of years before the new standard is implemented, which would give the Government breathing space in which to commit extra resources or to deliver extra affordable homes to allow the standard's introduction not to cause perverse effects. No one in the Chamber wants a new definition to cause perverse effects. If the Minister for Housing and Planning is arguing that the definition should not be included in the Bill because it will immediately cause perverse effects, a sunrise clause is a possible solution that he should examine seriously.",41863,[],Housing,0,18,housing,894

2003-10-29,Housing,446,Matthew Green,LibDem,False,"I accept that. The current definitions also cause perverse effects. I am attempting to give Ministers a means by which they can accept a new definition without causing themselves problems. The supply of affordable homes lies at the heart of the matter. Every time an affordable home is built, it has a double effect on reducing overcrowding. If some people are moved out of an overcrowded home, the problem is solved for two households. The Government are not doing enough on supply, and the answer involves more than throwing more money at the system. Planning gain is one of the major ways in which we can deliver more affordable homes. The hon. Member for St. Albans discussed a site in his area that contains 30 per cent. affordable homes. I say, "" Well done,"" but that is not going far enough.",41863,[],Housing,0,20,housing,141

One problem is that the Government's guideline suggests applying the percentage rule to sites containing 19 or more houses. We must apply that percentage throughout the country. Given the growth in house prices, there is sufficient affordability in the system for planning gain to deliver the extra houses. The Government must be stronger in driving through a higher percentage on all sites to ensure that planning gain is recovered from the system. We need not only a few local authorities situated here and there doing that but large numbers of them in high-demand areas. Otherwise, developers will avoid developing in one area and shift across to the next one. That is where the Government can have a significant impact.",41863,[],Housing,0,22,housing,151

2003-10-29,Housing,451,Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,Con,False,"This has been an excellent debate. I congratulate the hon. Members for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), for St. Albans (Mr. Pollard) and for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King). It is a pity that we did not hear from the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love). I congratulate him on his Housing (Overcrowding) Bill, his persistence as chairman of the all-party homelessness and housing need group and the work that he has done on the subject. It is common ground among us all that something must be done about the problem. I came across an interesting article by James Gleeson and Maya Martinez. The headline conclusion was that "" London has three times the overcrowding problems of elsewhere in England, with one in 20 households now affected, according to 2001 census data."" There is doubt about whether the census data understate the scale of the problem in London, but they do make the point that while the problem is getting worse in London, it is probably getting marginally better in the rest of the country. The article comes up with a shocking statement that although "" only 2 per cent. of white families in London live in overcrowded conditions, for ethnic minority households the figure is over 14 per cent.-climbing to around 25 per cent for some Asian groups."" The point has already been made about the severe effect on children. We know that the problems of families who are homeless or living in overcrowded conditions are, in some instances, becoming much worse. Indeed, in his excellent speech in the House to introduce his Bill, the hon. Member for Edmonton said that "" until the late 1980s, the number of overcrowded households fell steadily year on year. In the past decade, the acute shortage of affordable accommodation has meant that many families have found themselves severely overcrowded but with little possibility of a move to larger, better-quality, family-sized accommodation."" He went on to say that ""500,000 households are overcrowded, of which about a third are in the capital."" Those figures have already been given by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green). The hon. Member for Edmonton then made the point that I have just made about child overcrowding. He stated: "" Many families experience severe effects on their health, welfare and well-being as a result of overcrowding. According to recent research, there is a high prevalence of skin disorders and infectious diseases. Owing to a lack of space, children are at much greater risk of having accidents, and the stress of living in such cramped conditions can place a severe strain on family relationships.""- I am sure that we all totally agree with that. The question is: what is to be done? The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow rightly asked the following question: "" To ask the Deputy Prime Minister on how many occasions since 1985 he has (a) received a report from a local housing authority and (b) directed a local housing authority to prepare and submit a report on the extent of overcrowding in their district, under section 334 of the Housing Act 1985"".- I am sorry to get slightly technical, but it is important to recognise that there are powers under section 334 of the Housing Act 1985, which allow local authorities to undertake a survey of overcrowding in their area, draw up a report for the Secretary of State on the nature and extent of the problem and make proposals to provide the required number of dwellings. No reports appear to have been drawn up or submitted to the Secretary of State since those provisions were consolidated, and no Government have taken specific action to address the housing needs of those in overcrowded accommodation. We need to take action to know the extent and scale of the problem. I hope that one outcome of today's debate will be the Minister telling us that she is taking real action to secure concrete data on the problem so that we know where it exists, how severe it is and which houses do not meet the 1985 standards, let alone the English housing condition survey standards. We need to have a handle on the problem, and once we have, as the hon. Member for Ludlow rightly said, we need to introduce primary legislation that will enable the Secretary of State by regulation to introduce a standard that can be incorporated over a period of time according to what resources are available. We also need to apply that to the private sector. In making these remarks, I am conscious that whatever we do with the private sector, we need to encourage more private sector investment in the residential sector. That is an important way of being able to produce more affordable homes. On page 17 of the report on overcrowding from the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, it is stated: "" Proportionately more private rented homes are in poor condition than in the other housing sectors. Ownership is highly fragmented: most landlords rent out only one or very few homes, and have little chance to become expert property managers. Many turn to letting agents for help but agents' standards of confidence and probity vary greatly."" We have to think very carefully about how we are to deal with the private sector to help it to overcome such problems. Although the Select Committee dealt with overcrowding and recommended a standard, the Government do not seem to have responded. The report was excellent, and it is an excellent way of going about our business to have the housing Bill subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny in that way. I quote what the report says on overcrowding at paragraph 32: "" Clauses 123-128 amend existing legislation on overcrowding in HMOs. Oona King MP's memorandum noted the effects of overcrowding on the health, welfare, education and employment prospects of occupiers. Yet as we heard from Shelter the problems caused by overcrowding outside of HMOs cannot be identified by the HHSRS""- the housing health and safety rating system. The report continues: "" We recommend that the Government take forward Shelter's recommendation that the Bill be used to modernise the current statutory overcrowding standards."" Members on both sides have suggested that the Bill could be an ideal opportunity to address the problem. We need to hear from the Minister whether it will be so used. If not, I do not think that we can wait another 18 years. The standards-or, at least, the mechanisms for gaining an indication of what the problem is-were laid down in the 1985 Act. We look to the Government for action on the problem.",41863,[],Housing,0,25,housing,1117

In those 10 seconds, I shall just quickly sum up what I think needs to be done. We must introduce more measures to encourage the private sector to invest in its existing housing and new housing. We need more measures to encourage the public sector to build more affordable houses, and in that respect we have already produced proposals to extend the right to buy. We need to deal with the problem of empty houses. Mention has been made of 750,000 empty houses. We need to deal with the powers that we have in the 1985 Act and part 7 of the Local Government Act 2003 in order to require local authorities to draw up housing strategies that include the issue of overcrowding. We should require regional housing boards to give priority to tackling overcrowding in developing the housing investment strategy. These recommendations come from Shelter. A new housing poverty indicator should be developed as part of the Government's measurement of child poverty and that should include an overcrowding element. Overcrowding should be included among the indicators used for the index of local deprivation. I appeal to the Minister to tell us how a new definition could be introduced into the Bill, over what time scale it could be introduced and how much it would cost.

Members will be aware that the Government try not to overburden local authorities with the collection of data, given the amount of data that they already have to provide. The Government know that a significant number of overcrowded households are in London. My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North was right to say that it is different in other parts of the country. London has specific housing problems. We must recognise that there is a problem but be very honest about how we address it. Overcrowding is not an isolated problem; it is often a symptom of wider problems, such as under-supply of affordable housing, as many hon. Members have said. Families may be living in cramped conditions because they cannot afford to move to a larger flat or home, or because the demand for social housing is too great and too many other families are waiting for a home. They may be homeless families, or families in bed-and-breakfast or temporary accommodation. Overcrowding is part of the more significant problem of housing supply, which must be addressed, in London in particular. Homelessness acceptances are another aspect of the same problem. They have increased to almost 31,000 in London. Bed-and-breakfast numbers have been reduced as a result of specific action taken by local authorities to address the problem of families stuck in cramped and inappropriate accommodation. It is one of the most severe aspects of the London housing problem. We must recognise that overcrowding is part of a wider issue, which involves meeting the decent homes target. The underlying problem is the need for affordable housing supply, particularly in the capital. That is why the sustainable communities plan set out a major investment programme expanding the provision of affordable housing in London and the south-east. The Government have established investment programmes in housing supply across the board with 200,000 homes in addition to those already planned. There has also been significant investment to increase the number of affordable homes, supporting the London Housing Board strategy of investment in key worker homes. The hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) raised the issue of planning gain. We are keen to use planning gain to expand the numbers of affordable housing units. That is why we are considering further section 106 agreements and consulting on empty homes, which was an issue that was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Mr. Pollard).

You are aware that I have always been a fan, and I am sure that we shall have a well ordered, if vigorous, debate. While I am in congratulatory mode, I shall anticipate later developments in the debate by welcoming the hon. Member for the wonderfully named constituency of South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes), to his new portfolio as the shadow Minister with responsibility for housing and planning. I am delighted to have secured this debate to talk about the Government's determination to give everyone the opportunity to have a decent home in a sustainable community. We clearly set out that aim in the 2000 housing Green Paper and the subsequent policy statement, which together represented the first comprehensive review of housing for nearly a quarter of a century. We are pressing forward with the implementation of the actions set out in those policy documents to deliver quality and choice across all types of housing, owned or rented, private or public. Our focus on delivery was sharpened when the Deputy Prime Minister set out his vision of sustainable communities in February 2003. That action programme recognises that to develop communities in which people wish to live, improvements in the supply and condition of housing need to be linked to improvement in economies, public services, transport and the environment. The communities plan sets out what the Government need to do to create thriving inclusive communities in all regions, backed by a significant increase in resources of Â£22 billion-an increase of 40 per cent. over the next three years-together with major reforms of the housing sector. Hon. Members will be aware that in March 2003 the Government published a draft Housing Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny and public consultation. That was very much the next step in the process. The Select Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government undertook an inquiry into the draft Bill, and I very much welcome its report. We found both pre-legislative scrutiny and public consultation extremely useful. We have carefully considered all the Select Committee's recommendations and we published our response to its report earlier this week. We have accepted some recommendations unconditionally, and have undertaken to consider others further. We are using those recommendations to produce a final Bill ready for introduction when Parliamentary time allows. We have not been able to accept all the recommendations, and where that is the case we have set out our reasons clearly. I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Select Committee's report in this debate. A good supply of decent quality, affordable housing is integral to any sustainable community. Today, I should like to focus on how the Government hope to achieve that goal in future legislation, and how we intend to deliver decent homes and decent places, and protect the most vulnerable in the housing market. Our proposals in the draft Housing Bill tackle some of the most pressing problems in private sector housing. More than 80 per cent. of housing in England is in the private sector. We intend to give home owners and private sector tenants access to well managed, well maintained houses. That means raising the quality and management of some of the housing that is in the worst condition, tackling bad landlords and antisocial tenants, improving the process of buying and selling homes and, as I have said, protecting the most vulnerable in the housing market. Our proposals are not just about private sector housing; some will cut across all tenures, and others will tackle specific problems faced by the social sector. More than two thirds of homes are owner-occupied. At some point, most people will buy or sell a property, and many of those people currently find that process fraught with problems, time-consuming, costly and stressful. The key problem is lack of transparency, and the Government are committed to taking action to improve that process. We will, therefore, press ahead with the home information pack provisions in the draft Bill. The introduction of such packs is a manifesto commitment. They will make home buying and selling easier, more transparent and more successful by making key information available right at the start of the process. Recent survey research has shown that nine out of 10 people are unhappy with the process of buying and selling homes, and the majority believe that the introduction of home information packs could go some way towards easing the buying process. I am delighted that our home information pack reforms have the full support of the Consumers Association. The Select Committee suggested further trialling of the packs before they are introduced on a compulsory basis. I do not agree. Home information packs are not new. International experience and the success of small-scale schemes in the UK have demonstrated the benefits. There has been a voluntary local pilot in the Bristol area, and we are currently testing home condition reports in different areas and markets. However, voluntary local pilots cannot replicate a compulsory national scheme, and I do not believe that further testing could tell us much more than we already know.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,1,housing,865

The home information pack will contain a home condition report, details of local searches, other legal documents and relevant planning consent. In future, after the introduction of European legislation on thermal efficiency, it will also contain information about the energy efficiency of the home up for sale. We have sought to provide as much information as possible by way of draft regulation and guidance, and if such a Bill were introduced, we would endeavour to lay as much information before the House as possible.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,3,housing,121

I do not for one moment recognise that figure of Â£1,000. Our estimate is that the pack will cost about Â£600, but it is important to remember that most of the elements of the pack are already elements for which the purchaser has to pay in normal circumstances. The only new element in the pack will be the home condition report. I want to allay the scaremongering that has occurred on the matter. It is worth remembering, while we are on the subject, the extraordinary costs to the economy at large and to individuals that result from the present unsatisfactory nature of the home-buying process. It is estimated that one in three would-be home sales fall through. That costs the economy Â£1 million a day, as well as the stress, anxiety and, often, despair caused to individuals. Inaction is not an option. On the basis of the evidence from trials and surveys here, and from the experience of implementation of the arrangement in Denmark and Australia, and reassured by the support of the Consumers Association, we are confident that this will prove an extremely popular, helpful and efficient way of contributing to the housing market.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,5,housing,212

Friend does as well-of people who bought a property and then found that it was subject to flooding, or subject to some joint access arrangement that they did not understand because their solicitors failed to do a proper search. The packs may not completely remove such problems, but they will substantially reduce them. I hope that my right hon. Friend agrees with that.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,6,housing,99
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],337,Keith Hill,Lab,False,"I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, who makes a valid point. He is right to say that all MPs find such cases replicated in their constituency advice surgeries. There have been calls to make the packs voluntary. Again, I disagree with that. Home information packs will be effective only if they are compulsory. Most transactions involve chains. Just one property marketed without a home information pack would negate the benefits that the packs provide for all the other transactions, as the chain will move at the pace of the slowest. There will always be people who want a free ride. They will look to benefit from others paying for a pack, but will not produce one themselves. However, I recognise the concerns raised by some in the industry about the readiness of the market. As I have said before, home condition reports will not be introduced until we are satisfied that sufficient numbers of home inspectors and satisfactory insurance arrangements are in place. The Select Committee had concerns about the impact of packs on low-value properties and low-demand areas. We are considering the results of our consultation on that subject. I recognise the potential merit of a value-based approach to any possible exemption, but I wish to take full account of the consultation exercise before reaching a decision. The House will be aware that in the draft Bill, a power was proposed to make different provision for different areas. That power could be used to deal with the issue. We could also use the power to facilitate a phased introduction of compulsory home information packs as part of a roll-out across England and Wales, if that were found to be practicable and advantageous. I am discussing that possibility with consumer and industry stakeholders. Most private sector housing is owner-occupied, but some 2 million people live in private rented accommodation. The private rented sector is growing again, and the Government are keen to work with landlords to improve its quality. Mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation is also a manifesto commitment, and we intend to set the scope of mandatory licensing in secondary legislation. We expect it to cover properties that have three or more storeys and house five or more people who constitute more than one household. The Select Committee recommended extending the scope of mandatory licensing. I am not convinced that that would be the best approach. I am keen to limit mandatory licensing to the highest-risk properties to avoid unnecessary regulation and costs for landlords and tenants. The man in Whitehall does not always know best. However, I fully accept that other HMOs could cause difficulties, and could benefit from licensing. There is scope in the proposed legislation to allow local authorities to apply licensing to problematic HMOs. Local authorities would need to consult those affected about their proposals for additional licensing. The proposals would then be subject to the consent of the Secretary of State. We are working with the Local Government Association to decide how best to operate such a consent scheme. Introducing licensing will ensure that landlords are fit and proper and that they have adequate management standards in place.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,7,housing,527

Friend is on that theme, may I remind him of the interrelationship between poor landlordism, antisocial behaviour and decline in demand in areas of low housing demand? In a village in my constituency where there is very poor demand, a good landlord, with the support of the community and myself as the local Member of Parliament, evicted tenants who were guilty of disgraceful behaviour. They were moved four houses up the street to a landlord who does not give a damn about what happens in the community. That has led to a migration of people from the street, abandoned houses, a further spiral of decline and problems with housing demand. Does the Minister accept that that is a problem and that, although we are not necessarily talking about HMOs, selective licensing might help?

2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],340,Keith Hill,Lab,False,"I shall certainly that I will stick to your stricture, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I count the election of my hon. Friend in that notable by-election as one of the very few achievements to which I have personally contributed during my period in Parliament. I enjoyed my visit to Hemsworth, and I am always open to offers to return. My hon. Friend is absolutely right about the devastating impact of poor management and criminality in areas of low demand, and that is why we are introducing a system of selective licensing, about which I will say more shortly. He identifies a problem that is repeated in city after city where there is so-called market failure. The Government are absolutely determined to take action on it as part of our antisocial behaviour agenda. I hope that I was sufficiently brief in my response to that intervention. We believe that the introduction of HMO licensing will ensure that landlords provide fit and proper management, and have adequate management standards in place. The HMO sector has some of the properties in the worst condition. A licensing regime would operate alongside a new health and safety rating system for housing, aimed at high-risk properties, including HMOs. The new rating system would replace the existing housing fitness standard, and help local authorities to concentrate their attention on the properties in the worst condition, which often house some of the most vulnerable people. The fitness standard dates back 80 years. There was widespread support for moving away from the fitness standard when we first consulted on it in 1998, and again in 2001. There is a close link between poor housing conditions and health. Our proposed new system would help local authorities target the properties where health and safety hazards present the greatest potential harm to occupants. The Select Committee report detailed some concerns, because we were unable to let the Committee see the detailed guidance for the system when it scrutinised the draft Bill. I revert to my earlier observations in response to my hon. Friend the Member for-",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,10,housing,343

2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],342,Keith Hill,Lab,False,"How can I forget my ministerial visit to Stafford? In the event of legislation, there will be two sets of guidance. I would intend to make a draft of the technical and enforcement guidance for the system available in advance of any parliamentary consideration of the legislation. Final versions of both sets of guidance would be published for the benefit of local authorities in the run-up to any implementation of the system. The new system is more sophisticated than the current fitness standard. It is evidence-based and allows local authorities to consider the actual harm that hazards present to the occupants, rather than the very blunt "" fit"" or "" unfit"" categorisation that we have now. I accept that the guidance material available to local authorities may be over-complicated for landlords who must understand their obligations, but do not need to apply the system. I am therefore committed to producing guidance aimed at landlords, which will be tested and trialled with them to make sure that it is user-friendly and understandable. I shall now discuss the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett). Tackling antisocial behaviour and neighbourhood decline is a top priority for the Government. As we have indicated, we intend to give local authorities new powers to license private landlords selectively. The powers will add to local authorities' armoury of measures to tackle neighbourhood decline and antisocial behaviour, particularly in the private rented sector. I know that the Select Committee argued for licensing to be as wide as possible, and I agree that we must consider further situations in which the power might be used. The draft Bill envisaged that it would be available to tackle low housing demand and other areas where there are problems such as antisocial behaviour and criminality. There may be other scenarios involving, for example, regeneration areas where selective licensing would help to involve private sector landlords in the redevelopment of communities. Again we are working with the Local Government Association to draw up the criteria for designating areas for selective licensing. Selective licensing is entirely new. If the powers were introduced, local authorities would be required to consult those affected locally and to seek the Secretary of State's consent before designating an area for licensing. I am keen to work with local authorities to see how the power might best be used. As we set out in our response to the Select Committee report, we want to introduce new provisions to help local authorities tackle antisocial behaviour in the social housing sector. Local authorities will be able to refuse mutual exchanges when tenants have been antisocial, and antisocial tenants could also lose their right to buy. The draft Bill proposed further modernisation of the right-to-buy scheme. The Select Committee welcomed that but, characteristically, called for more. We have carefully considered the recommendations of both the Committee and the home ownership task force, whose report is published today. I pay tribute on behalf of the House to its work under the able chairmanship of Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde. In the light of both reports, the Government have decided to introduce at the appropriate time further right-to-buy measures, so that the right to buy can contribute more effectively and more fairly to the supply of affordable housing. The Government also expect to make changes to the regulatory powers of the Housing Corporation and the National Assembly for Wales, which include allowing payment of grants to organisations other than registered social landlords, such as developers and builders, to develop affordable housing. That should widen opportunities to develop new affordable housing. During the consultation process on the draft Bill, there have, of course, been calls to add further provisions. Where there is a case for taking immediate action and where we are in a position to legislate, I have been ready to consider the addition of such provisions. However, I have not accepted all the proposed additions. I know that there is significant support for a tenancy deposit scheme and compulsory leasing of empty homes. In both cases, we must consider the issues carefully before acting. We are committed to considering tenancy deposits in the wider context of the Law Commission's proposals on housing tenure published earlier this month. In introducing the debate, I have been concerned to set out the Government's latest thinking on the draft Housing Bill and how we might advance our proposals. All in all, I believe that the proposals that I have highlighted will make for a more efficient and effective housing market that better protects the most vulnerable people. I now turn with eager anticipation to hearing the views and responses of my hon. Friends and Opposition Members to those important proposals.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,12,housing,787

2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],344,Oona King,Lab,False,"I commend the Minister on securing this debate on improving housing conditions and making the market work better. Ironically, if we left housing supply to the market, it would cripple the economy. That is because without social housing or the subsidy of private sector housing to those on low incomes, areas of high-value housing such as London would be left with only the very rich. The very rich are very good for some things, but in other areas they are good for nothing. One of those areas is key worker activity. Millionaires never make good nurses, teachers, police officers, bus drivers or dustbin men. However, without those groups, the capital's economy would seize up. I wish to structure my brief contribution around how to increase the supply of affordable housing and how to make that housing decent. We also need to consider how we are to bring the money into that area, because there is such a large backlog, which we heard about earlier. It stood at Â£19 billion in 1997. In Tower Hamlets, the council believes-as does Pricewaterhouse Coopers, which it commissioned to research the matter-that in its case, of the various options that the Government gave to local authorities to bring their houses up to a decent standard, the only viable one is stock transfer. That is because Tower Hamlets has negative values. Even if we group together some of the good housing, it is so outweighed by housing that is of a poorer quality that we are unable to make the sums add up without extra help and private investment. The other thing that both the Government and the council are keen to do is to increase local resident involvement. For that reason, Tower Hamlets embarked on housing choice, which was a programme to allow local residents the chance to decide how they would like the future housing requirements of Tower Hamlets to be met. The majority of residents voted for further inquiries into stock transfer. The problem that we face, and it goes to the heart of this debate-making the market work better-is that the market on its own, and private investment on its own, cannot make our sums in Tower Hamlets add up. Consider the Government's new decent homes standard: in London, 54 per cent. of council homes fail to meet the decent standard. However, in Tower Hamlets, 76 per cent. of council homes fail to meet it. That is because, historically, Tower Hamlets has had some of the worst housing in Britain, and that is why my constituency in the east end was home to the very first council estate ever built. However, for decades- I hear my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) saying from a sedentary position that it was Bradford. However, I will have him know that the Boundary estate was set up in the very fine constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow. If he would like to challenge me to a duel on the matter, I shall be happy to undertake the challenge. There has been under-investment for decades. It is not realistic to think that Tower Hamlets can, on its own, make good the lack of investment that has left us with 76 per cent. of council tenants living in homes that do not meet the decent standard. I therefore want to impress upon the Minister the urgency of the situation, because at the moment we have a programme ready to go, but we cannot move forward. There is some disquiet because we were given to understand in the communities plan that some money would be available to help stock transfer, just as money is available to help some of the other options. I have written to my right hon. Friend on that, and I hope to meet him very soon to put some of these concerns to him in much greater detail, but the long and the short of it is that if we do not get gap funding to help stock transfer in Tower Hamlets, we will not be able to meet the Government's decent homes target by 2010. We cannot fudge it. There is no simpler way of putting it than that. We will not be able to meet that standard. Even sadder than that is the fact that we would lose the momentum that has built up around the current attempts, which have been supported by local residents. For example, I commend Bernie Cameron who has been working very hard with the tenant compact group to get the momentum going so that we are able to move forward with this programme of stock transfer. It is ironic that residents and the local authority in Tower Hamlets are trying to do what the Government are encouraging us to do, but-I am sure for purely technical reasons-we have not yet been able to move forward. I understand that the Minister is not able to give me a substantial response now, and I would not expect that, but perhaps he can agree to meet constituents, or a group of residents, from Tower Hamlets in the future, after he has met the delegation from Tower Hamlets and heard what an astonishingly good case it has to put forward. I said that I would be brief, and I shall be. In leaving this subject, I mention two other items, but shall not go into them in detail. The first is the tenancy deposit scheme. I have raised that in the House previously. I seemed to detect from what the Minister said that the Government are perhaps evolving their thinking on the matter. I certainly hope that is the case. My second point is on overcrowding. The Minister will be aware that my constituency has the worst overcrowding in Britain. I took one of his predecessors to visit an extended family where 16 people were living in two bedrooms. That really is unacceptable. Even stranger is that a family of eight people living in two bedrooms is not statutorily overcrowded under the overcrowding standard introduced in 1935. Obviously, I would appreciate some improvement there. I just remind the Minister that one of the reasons why the Government are looking at improving housing conditions and making the market work better is that we want to reduce child poverty. That is a Government pledge: halving child poverty and then ending it within a generation. The fact is that in England 48 per cent.-nearly half-of all children who live in poverty live in inner London. For that reason, I urge the Minister to make progress on these issues.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,14,housing,1097
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],345,David Kidney,Lab,False,"I shall start by discussing housing conditions, then move on to the need to make the market work better. I shall start in a very good place: empty homes. Statistics show that 130,000 or so households are without a permanent home of their own, while at any one time 750,000 properties in the country stand empty, and that makes it easy to see why we should be determined to take more effective action on bringing empty homes back into use. I once promoted a ten-minute Bill, the Empty Homes Bill, which was published and had four elements. The first was that every authority should have a strategy for reducing the incidence of empty homes. The second was that data exchange should be available to enable authorities to identify empty homes. The third was that we should do something about the exemptions from paying council tax on properties standing empty, and the fourth was that we should strengthen local authorities' powers of compulsory purchase. I am pleased to say that that Bill obviously had some effect because, since it was published, the Government have taken action on all four matters. The provision to allow data exchange was a welcome recognition by the Government, but action on the other three was not quite as well achieved as I should have liked, so I shall give the Minister seven out of 10 on that subject. I shall move on from empty homes to the renovation of homes in which people live that could do with being in better condition. There are problems. The Minister mentioned the experience we get from our casework. I have discovered from mine that people who are disabled and would like adaptations to their homes to make them suitable for their disability find that they face huge delays. They either experience delay in getting social services to make an assessment of their home or delay afterwards in getting help from public homes to make the adaptations, even when the disabled facilities grant is mandatory-and that is not to mention the discretionary grants they may also need. I hope that the Minister will pay some attention to that. Beyond that, some people would simply like to renovate homes rather than build new ones. It seems curious to me that people still pay VAT to renovate existing properties, but there is no VAT involved in building a brand new house on a greenfield site. It gives a rather curious sense of our values that we allow that to continue, but we do. The Government deserve a huge pat on the back for their work on market renewal. Last Friday, I was able to attend a briefing for the market renewal pathfinder in north Staffordshire. Although that is not in my constituency, I regard my area as part of the north Staffordshire economy and, after all, Stoke-on-Trent is my home town, so I take a close interest in the matter. I say to the Minister that the pathfinder in Stoke needs close attention and support. There has been terrible neglect in the area, both in its physical fabric and the capacity of the local work force to be able to do the kind of work that is necessary. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic when he faces requests for help, even in relation to the personnel needed to help with the work of the pathfinder. I learned from that experience, and I appreciate from the national approach that there has to be a strategic approach both to housing problems that must be faced and met, and to wider community challenges such as infrastructure, jobs and training that go with housing. All those issues need to be addressed, supported, and publicised, so that the schemes-as they are seen to be successful-expand throughout the country. My main plea concerning conditions of properties is that we should look to the future and make homes more environmentally sustainable. Some elements of sustainability are included in existing building regulations. Part L relates to energy efficiency, and part M relates to life-long standards and disability access, each of which is under some criticism. Part L is already outdated and part M, even though it was effective only from 1999, is already the subject of criticism. I saw some research findings from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggesting that there is wholesale ignorance or wilful disregard of part M standards, both by local authorities and developers. That is a worrying piece of research to read. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that his Department is determined that existing building regulations will be properly enforced. Going beyond those regulations, the Building Research Establishment has done some excellent work in developing eco-homes standards. A good physical example of such eco-homes is the BedZED project, and we are all receiving invites to see it. I am sorry that I have not been yet; I want to go. It would be helpful to develop such schemes throughout the country so that they would be showcases of success. I would like to volunteer my area of the country for a pilot. I congratulate WWF, which has a campaign promoting sustainable homes. Like myself, it thinks that there should be eco-homes demonstration sites throughout the country. It is trying to interest investors in taking an interest in investing in such developments, and it is looking to launch awards for good practice in that area. Next year, it hopes to sponsor jointly with the Housing Corporation a web-based toolkit of good practice. The urgency for such work is clear from a report produced by WWF, called "" One Planet Living in the Thames Gateway"". I took notice of the very first sentence: "" If everyone on the planet were to consume natural resources and pollute the environment as we currently do in the UK, we would need three planets to support us."" That is a pretty frightening statistic. Does the Minister agree that we could update our building regulations to concentrate more on eco-homes standards? Is it right that that requires primary legislation? Is it right that the Minister and his Department want to set up a sustainable buildings task group to sort out the new building regulations, and if so, is it not time that such a task group was established? Having spoken to many people involved on all sides of the industry, I find that there is a great desire for things to move forward quickly, and everywhere I go I am told that people are not doing so because the Government are not acting quickly. Please can the Minister pay some attention to that? It is pretty urgent given that the Government are committed to such a lot of new building in the near future, including in the Thames gateway. It would be nice to think that we could build the next great developments to eco-standards. I do not want to say more about housing conditions, but there is one point that the Minister did not mention when talking about the items that he rejected for inclusion in the Housing Bill: the situation of people who live in park homes. The subject has been well investigated, and the Government have accepted that existing legislation is inadequate. Retired people put their life savings into buying a park home, which they locate on a site where they must pay a licence fee. Existing legislation does not protect them from harassment, abuse of their rights or overcharging for the utilities that everyone else takes for granted, as long as they pay their bills. It really is time that such people had better protection. My plea is that the Housing Bill is a good opportunity to give them the modern law that is needed. I want to mention several items in connection with making the market work better. I am concerned about the inability of young people in rural areas to remain in the communities where they grew up. They cannot do so because no affordable homes are left in their villages. My concern is shared by the communities themselves, all the councils-from parishes up to counties-the Country Land and Business Association and the Countryside Agency, representatives of both of which I met recently, and many others. There is a need for more intense effort to deliver more affordable homes and more homes generally in rural areas. I know that the Government have reviewed PPG3 and have recently completed consultation on the exceptions policy and whether to replace it with a new land-use planning designation of social housing. However, I ask the Minister to recognise the urgency of providing ways to deliver more homes in rural areas. With the development of quality town and parish councils, this could be a really good time for a renaissance of power and respect for those councils. If every one of them could be encouraged and required to carry out village appraisals and design statements for their areas, local communities might join in with the spirit of ensuring that there is enough housing in their area. The appraisal of present options for council housing has just reached Stafford. The council is appraising its four options-or is it really only three? It cannot afford to reach decent home standards for council housing by 2010, and the Government will not say that it can have any extra resources to bridge that gap. Are people really being told that, practically, there is a choice of only three? I am a little worried about that approach. In Stafford, as in some other high-profile cases, the tenants like the council and its housing management enough to vote against a transfer. It would be embarrassing people were told that they had chosen an option that they could not have. I would like the Government to be a little more sympathetic towards good councils that want to continue their council housing. At the strategic level, council housing is important as part of a diverse housing market and can act as a restraint on house prices rushing ahead. It is a social service for those who cannot afford a home and is popular with some people I would like it to survive. The Minister and I exchanged a few words about home information packs. I support the project as a consumer protection measure, but there are warnings about the difficulties. One is that there will not be enough surveyors. It is curious that people seem to want to turn away business. I would have thought that they would want to develop capacity. There are complaints about the cost, but I would have thought that the market would quickly develop to include options for sellers to have the cost added on to their mortgage and paid off when they sell their home. I would be surprised if cost was genuinely an objection. I met representatives of the Council of Mortgage Lenders last week, and I am concerned about the attitude of lenders towards the surveyor's report. It is clear that they still want their own report to assess the good value of the security for the money that they lend. I like to think that they would be a little more co-operative, ensuring that they take account of the house condition report in the home information pack so that they can reduce or scale back the requirements for their own valuation report. In the past, a lot of people mistakenly thought that because they paid the lender for a report, they had a report that guaranteed that everything was all right with their property. In fact, all it guaranteed was that the lender had good value for their security. Those people were not necessarily protecting themselves. I found many examples in my casework of people who many years later discovered that something was defective about their property or the area in which they lived, which then could not be put right. That is why I support the measure as a matter of consumer protection.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,15,housing,1997

They may be controversial to some of my hon. Friends, but I have been able to make them personally and directly to my right hon. Friend the Minister. To make the market work, particularly in my area of south-west London, the Government and public need to expand the possibility for low-cost home ownership, whether outright or through shared ownership. My right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) made an interesting speech only last weekend. He identified home ownership as something that was not only desired by the majority of people in this country, but was an important force for social mobility. Home ownership leads to a greater likelihood of remaining in one's home for longer, to greater educational opportunities for one's children and even, surprisingly, to a greater likelihood of marriages lasting longer.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,17,housing,157

2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],349,Siobhain McDonagh,Lab,False,"I have to accept that the right to buy has been a great success, allowing estates to mature and allowing working-class people opportunities that they would never otherwise have had. I am disappointed that the money gained through the sale of homes was not reinvested to provide more homes. That was a major error in the plans. I do not accept that council tenants and social tenants should be responsible for the housing of people on the lists. We have to increase supply. Figures suggest that one would need an income of at least Â£54,000 a year to get one of the cheapest homes in London. That is outside the best efforts of most of the people that we know. Last week, I made notes from my weekly advice surgery on the sort of housing problems that were identified. Nearly all involved people who would like to buy a home but cannot afford to. They included a couple with an income of Â£28,000, and two nursery nurses who work in a local school who, together with their partners, have incomes in the region of Â£26,000 to Â£30,000. They cannot take the first step on the ladder. Although such incomes are not low in relation to the rest of the country, they still leave buying a home outside the scope of buyers in an area of London that is far cheaper than most others. I urge the Government to look at increasing the supply of shared-ownership houses, particularly in outer London and south-west London. Shared ownership offers an option for people who cannot take the first step. Making the first step is what is most important. It allows people to see that their lives will get better, and that they can take the next step. That is important not only for people who live with family or friends, but for people on estates. I have spoken to the Minister about my constituents who live in housing association homes on large estate and who desperately want to buy their homes and stay there and who want to contribute to the community. They see housing prices going up everywhere else and feel that they are letting their children down by not being able to move off the estate and buy. I do not want to let down my constituent Donna Neblett, who runs the south Mitcham community centre on the Phipps Bridge estate, and who is a south London family housing association tenant. She and her husband Trevor desperately want to stay there to continue the voluntary youth work that they do, to bring their children up and to send them to the local schools, but they feel that they have no option but to move out because they cannot buy where they are. I do not want to let down other people on that estate, many of whom work at the immigration and nationality directorate, who find that their options are cut off. Despite working a full week and being on an average salary, home ownership is out of their grasp. I welcome today's home ownership report. I am sorry that I have not had the opportunity to read it in detail, but I hope that it contains exciting possibilities for people to get on to the home-ownership ladder.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,19,housing,547
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],350,David Drew,Lab,False,"I am delighted to take part in the debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and with the Minister. I am afraid that my remarks will be brief as I have to leave slightly before the end to catch a train, but it is important that we bring a number of perspectives to the debate. I was going to argue that housing in rural areas is a fundamentally different issue from that for some of my colleagues here from urban areas, but it is interesting how common themes arise. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) spoke with great authority about his area and about the mixed housing issues of some urban areas, not the big urban conurbations, but those areas with a rural hinterland around them. He rightly emphasised some of the issues that I wish to touch on, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) outlined some of the problems that she faces. They are the same problems that we face in rural areas, but on a different scale. I will start with large-scale voluntary transfer, although I will not spend long on it as that would be improper. We are undergoing a ballot, so it would be most inappropriate to go into the details, but I must say that it has been a most divisive process. It has brought out the worst aspects of how campaigning can get the better of finding the best way forward. There should be genuine choice, but many tenants who have come to me feel that their choice has been at least restricted, if not taken away. I will take up some of the issues of transparency and openness, because people have felt overwhelmed by the number of arguments. I have brought that point up before, but the way that the issue has been slanted on both sides has not been helpful. I know that I have taken a clear position, but we need to consider the process and get the best outcome rather than the one that has been most heavily weighted in a certain direction.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,20,housing,353
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],351,Jon Trickett,Lab,False,"On the question of stock transfers, has my hon. Friend had the same experiences as I have? Elderly people who have no right to buy and who live in allocated houses fear that they will be stampeded by a majority yes vote. Those who vote yes will still retain the right to buy, but elderly people who feel trapped in their homes may then be transferred to a new landlord, whom they voted against, and they will not have the option of the right to buy. That is a particularly difficult problem and, as my hon. Friend just stated, it is very divisive.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,21,housing,103
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],352,David Drew,Lab,False,"I will not repeat that I think that the process is divisive, but the arguments that my hon. Friend has advanced are certainly some of those that I have come across. It is all linked to issues such as the right to buy. I was on a council that propagated right to buy before it became the Conservative party's official policy, I have never been agin it, but I am agin the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) said in response to the Conservative spokesman, the money obtained was never reinvested. That is where the scheme went wrong, and in rural areas in particular it has resulted in a form of social exclusion. A small number of council houses used to be available in every community in my constituency, but they have, virtually to a house, gone. That has excluded those communities from an important provision for ever. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford touched on a number of issues in the rural domain. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow talked about market failure in urban centres, and it is fair to say that there has been a market failure in rural Britain. The affordability index in the Joseph Rowntree Trust's research shows that many people are now completely excluded and cannot move to, let alone live in, rural Britain. That is not acceptable, and with the paucity of rented accommodation, the situation has been made that much worse. It would take too long to analyse fully such a complex subject, and many people have done it much better than I have. However, the main issues are land availability, the planning process and the funding mechanism to make housing affordable. I am pleased that the Government have grappled with the planning process. My right hon. Friend the Minister put his finger on the problem when he talked about the important consultation on exceptions policy and whether we should move away from that. He covered that point, however, so I shall say no more about it. There is a problem with the method of funding in rural areas. Much as I welcome the communities plan, I should like my right hon. Friend the Minister to say something about the rural dimension. We feel that we are still at the margins somewhat, which is perhaps inevitable given the scale of the housing problem that the country faces. We need to hear more about how to get affordable housing in rural areas, because the issue is not only about choice, but about providing both a balanced country and, dare I say it, a balanced economy. The problem that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow mentioned is the same in rural areas. People cannot afford to live there. Where do the social workers come from? Where do the police live? They cannot afford to live there and it is not sustainable in the long term for them to travel 50 miles to do the job. We must do something about that. There is still disappointment that the local authority special housing grant was removed-there was even a delay in the removal. We need clarity on the current situation. There has been no demand to reinstate the grant, because we accept that we are now part of the communities plan, but we need graduation towards the help that is needed, but that has not been forthcoming. Moira Constable of the Royal housing trust, who is an ally of mine, has sent my right hon. Friend the Minister a letter, although it was not written on my behalf. The trust has done some wonderful work on housing and has called for clarity on where the revenue streams will come from. The answer is not yet clear. The other issue that needs to be addressed is the link with key worker housing. The price of land has taken us away from how we normally provide housing. I hope that the Government will be innovatory in considering that key problem. As much as I would like the existing choice to be broadened, we must look at some new ideas, one of which must be some form of community land trust. I will not bore hon. Members with the details, but, for those who want to read more, I draw their attention to the fact that, in the last few weeks the New Economics Foundation issued a good report at an event that I was pleased to host, called "" Common Ground-for Mutual Home Ownership"". It argues that if the land can be owned communally, and if people can be given the opportunity to have a stake in it by paying rent but can also benefit from the value of the appreciation of the land, they can see themselves gaining advantages that they are denied under council home ownership. They are locked into what I like to see-a mutual, co-operative solution that has many merits. It is new to this country, and it can work in urban areas, but we are especially interested in how it can be applied in rural ones. I am pleased that one of the trial areas is my constituency, which has an acute problem with the affordability of housing. I hope that my right hon. Friend will listen to future lobbying and will read the report to see whether it is applicable. It has merit, but it needs to be properly analysed to see whether it can break through the terrible problem of the high price of land and therefore of housing. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford identified park homes as a problem. I totally concur with what he said. I hope that there is a way of dealing with this problem under a new housing Bill, because park home estates are a real difficulty. We all have them in our constituencies, and people want answers. We have given them many promises and told them what needs to be done, and what could be done, but we must now come up with answers. We are discussing ways in which we can improve housing, and I understand that we cannot discuss everything in such a short debate, but I spend a great deal of time examining one issue that we have not yet touched on. However, the fact that older people tend to live in older properties needs to be addressed. Much of that property is substandard. If we are to overcome the problems faced by older people and do what we can for them, as we discussed during cross-cutting questions, we must ensure that housing is at the centre of health care provision. It is, dare I say it, central to a good quality of life. One of the ways in which we can do that is by ensuring that we invest properly in property for older people. For more than a decade, I have been proud to be associated with Care and Repair England, which was set up to improve homes. Care and Repair England, along with other organisations, will often carry out the most basic tasks such as replacing plugs, ensuring that light bulbs work and installing smoke detectors. It sometimes does more substantial work by contracting that out to other agencies. We should not underestimate how important all this is, but it will not solve the problems of older people and their care needs on its own. Housing must never come third in the list of priorities, because the issue is often related to why people are readmitted to hospital.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,22,housing,1268
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],353,John Hayes,Con,False,"The hon. Gentleman is right. As he will know, I took the opportunity in cross-cutting questions to draw attention to the plight of older people and their housing. Although the solution might not be quite so simple, he was also right to suggest that by assisting elderly people through the sort of services that he mentioned and by adapting their homes, they can often stay in their own homes and retain a dignity and an independence that is not usually allowed them. Does he not agree that we need to be much more ambitious in the ways that he described?",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,23,housing,100
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],354,David Drew,Lab,False,"I totally agree. That is the only way to avoid the bottomless pit of moneys that will be required if we continue to have only one answer. We must find other ways of allowing people to stay in their own homes if they so wish, but they must be safe. Those ways can include new ideas such as telecare and telemedicine, which are as important in rural areas as they are in urban settings. More important, we must ensure that the strategy is cohesive rather than an ad hoc part of community safety endeavours, which it has tended to be. Again, the Government deserve to be congratulated on driving the agenda. Many good things are going on, but much more needs to be done. I hope that my right hon. Friend will listen to some of the new ideas, which are desperately needed to crack this highly emotive problem. Housing has moved to the top of the agenda for rural Britain. It has overtaken transport, which was on its own five years ago as the problem we had to crack. It is a political issue but, with the right policies, I am sure that we can do a great deal to solve the problems.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,24,housing,204

2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],356,Brian Iddon,Lab,False,"Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am pleased that in this Parliament, unlike the last one, housing is high on the agenda. It is not as high on the agenda, nor are the resources for it as great, as some of us would like; nevertheless, it is in the ascendant. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister on his ministerial position. I like a person who smiles a lot, because it radiates hope, and I am hopeful that we will continue to make progress as long as he has that job. Let me first make a few points about the private sector. I have some fears about the thrust towards owner-occupation. In my town we are absolutely saturated with owner-occupation, which stands at 70 per cent.; I understand that the national average is 65 to 67 per cent. In some cases, owner-occupation is unsustainable. I congratulate the Government on the present low interest and mortgage rates, which have made a very positive contribution. I hope that they stay low. However, if they do not, I fear that hundreds of thousands of people will be caught out by increased mortgage rates. I have a feeling that people are borrowing well above their capacity, in order to buy a house. Of course we all aspire to home ownership. I put my hand up, as I too am an owner-occupier-but I can afford to be one. Indeed, my mortgage is paid off, but some people are in a much more difficult position, with mortgages well out of the range for their earnings-or joint earnings, for a couple. That nettle has not been grasped by any Government.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,26,housing,274
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],357,Siobhain McDonagh,Lab,False,"Does my hon. Friend agree that other European countries, including Ireland and Holland, as well as others that I cannot recall at the moment, have a substantially higher proportion of owner-occupation? The United States, too, has a higher rate of ownership. The present structure of mortgages and home ownership does not mean that innovative ways cannot be found to make purchasing more possible and home ownership more secure.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,27,housing,68
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],358,Brian Iddon,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend makes a good point. But the history of owner-occupation in this country shows that things have not always been as they are now. We ought to prepare ourselves to enable people to move in and out of tenures much more easily than has been possible in Britain. For example, if owner-occupiers-or perhaps hundreds of thousands of them if there is an economic crisis, which cannot be ruled out, regardless of the party in power-get into difficulty, why can we not persuade building societies, and especially registered social landlords, to take over ownership of the homes but allow the people to stay in them? Surely we could be a bit more radical with housing policy, so that people do not descend into disaster if there is a sudden change in economic circumstances. I am worried about the saturation point of owner-occupation, and I am also concerned that people buy homes without realising how much the maintenance will cost. That is especially true for older properties, although new properties have their difficulties, too. People who can just about afford the mortgage move into older properties, and then when the roof trusses go and the whole roof has to be replaced, the family faces economic disaster. Building societies and local authorities do not give enough advice to people about what it will actually cost them to pay for not only the utilities, but the maintenance of a home. Owner-occupation is not all plain sailing, although, as I said earlier, we all aspire to it. Turning to the subject of houses in multiple occupation, I thank the Government, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for helping Bolton when it was in a very difficult situation. A few years ago, the police put a lot of effort into clearing prostitution out of a commercial area; the only trouble was that they drove the prostitution over a main road into a residential area, merely displacing the problem. The residential area is a lovely place called the Haulgh. Fred Dibnah, the famous steeplejack, is a resident, and he lives in a nice cottage called the cat cottage. It is not a stereotypically run-down area; it contains some very nice properties. In one corner of the Haulgh, there are some very large three and four-storey Victorian houses that have been broken up into flats. Police pressure drove the prostitution and the associated drug taking and antisocial behaviour into those flats. Bolton council had an innovative scheme for enveloping the flats, because they were ready for refurbishment and some were in a terrible condition. The problem was that one landlord who owned a substantial number of flats would not pay his whack, so the scheme was going to fall through. The residents of the Haulgh, Greater Manchester police, Bolton local authority and I all pressed the Government to help us with that difficult problem, and a Government pilot scheme for tackling antisocial behaviour is now in place. With Greater Manchester police, the local authority and, in particular, the efforts of the local the residents association, we are starting to turn that area-or at least, that corner of it-around. I look forward to seeing the Housing Bill. I hope that it will be in the Queen's Speech on 26 November, and that we can get to grips with some of the issues that we are only flagging up today. I want to license HMOs. Some landlords do not take their responsibilities seriously, although the vast majority are okay. As in any difficult situation, a small minority are spoiling the barrel. Some residents live in very unsatisfactory conditions, with heat escaping through windows. I am a great advocate of energy efficiency and we must put in more work to provide warm homes in the HMO part of the private sector. In my town we have more than 20,000 unfit owner-occupied houses. Even with increased investment in Bolton, houses are becoming unfit for habitation faster than we can improve them. It is not surprising that in places such as Burnley and in many of the industrial towns on both sides of the Pennines people have been voting with their feet and leaving. The houses are more than 150 years old, which in terms of Victorian and Georgian buildings does not sound very old, but those houses were not built to last. They were built largely by factory owners, who used the brick-on-end method, with inner and outer skins touching, and common attics that were, and still are, an absolute disaster if fire breaks out. It flashes through the attics and sets the other houses on fire. I have argued with previous Governments, and the present Government, that the only way to deal with such areas is to free up some green space, introduce the best schools to attract people in, and knock down some of the properties. I am not suggesting that we ruin communities as we did in the 1960s and 1970s. When I joined Bolton housing committee in 1977, the housing clearance programme consisted of 1,000 properties. When I took over as chairman in 1986, I killed the clearance programme, because there was no money for it; now it has returned, but only street by street. In pathfinder areas such as Burnley, and in towns that might have been pathfinder areas, such as Bolton and Blackburn, we need help to clear clapped-out properties in a sensitive way. If we do not, people will continue to leave those areas and we will not succeed in maintaining communities. However, this issue is wider than just housing in pathfinder areas. It is about the infrastructure; it is about accessing a dentist, a doctor or a good school. If the infrastructure is not right, even if the houses have been improved, people will continue to leave those areas. I am pleased that the Government have created the pathfinder areas; they are experiments and I hope that they will be successful. I also hope that that success will be extended to similar areas in my town. I am also in favour of sellers' packs, now known as home information packs. The figure of Â£600 sounds like a lot of money to assemble one of the packs. In fact, that is a lot higher than the figure given when we discussed the issue in a Standing Committee on a Bill that fell in a previous Session of Parliament, but I still support the idea. I served on the Committee on the Water Bill, and was amazed to hear from colleagues, especially those from the midlands, that so many private sewers are to be adopted under that Bill. That will cost the Government a lot of money. I commented that I was surprised that the solicitors conducting the searches for people buying the houses had not flagged up the private sewer issue for them. It is important, especially with older housing, that all the information about the history of the house be in the sellers' packs. People should not have to pay again and again to do the same search to find the same information-and in some cases the information is not found, because a poor solicitor has been employed. Sellers' packs are similar to MOTs on cars. We know the history of the car from its MOT, and similarly we will know the history of the house from the seller's pack.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,28,housing,1229

Friend's flow about home information packs, but I must tell him that the Government have inserted a provision in the Water Bill, so that if they decided that water companies should adopt more private sewers, the legal provision would be there.

2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],360,Brian Iddon,Lab,False,"I am grateful to my hon. Friend for correcting me. He is right, and I apologise for misleading the Chamber. I shall talk briefly about tenancy deposit schemes. A strong message must be sent from Parliament to landlords. If landlords continue to rob the poorest members of society of their deposits when they have done nothing wrong in the house, and have not broken anything or missed any rent, they deserve what they get. A small percentage of landlords are ruining things for the rest, but that is what happens when a small number in any group causes problems. We are under pressure to legislate. It would be nice if we did not have to legislate, but if landlords do not behave themselves and do not repay tenancy deposits to people who are eligible to receive them, we will have to do so. There is another option. Several years ago it came to my attention that many people in Bolton were being asked to pay so-called key deposits. People had to put a deposit down before they could pay their first week's, fortnight's or month's rent, but many poor people do not have that kind of money. Somebody suggested that I, as chairman of the housing committee, should set up a bond board, based on an Australian model. The housing committee still supports the bond board, which has to raise a considerable sum through charitable donations. The bond board pays the landlord a tenancy deposit to secure the property. The tenant does not pay the bond; the bond board pays it. The bond board also follows the tenant and gives them any help that they may require to maintain the tenancy, but if the tenant leaves the private rented property there is an interest in getting the money back, because if nothing has been broken, it can be recycled. I am a great advocate of bond board schemes, of which there are not enough in Britain. The bond board that I started in Bolton was one of the first in Britain. I have already mentioned to my right hon. Friend the Minister the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. It contains a section on nominated insurance, which is a common problem in the north-west, and particularly in my town, Bolton. When someone pays ground rent, some deeds give the owner of the ground rent the right to nominate an insurance company with which the property and its contents must be insured. Many people have complained about companies that graze ground rents-my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner) introduced the expression, "" ground rent grazing"". Such companies buy thousands of ground rents at auction and try to extort money from the people who pay the ground rents. The ground rents are worth about a fiver, but each time such companies write a letter they seem to stick on an administration charge. The main reason why they buy ground rents is to exercise their right to nominate an insurer, from which they get commissions. The insurance company involved used to be AXA, but in my town it is now Norwich Union. We put a section in the 2002 Act to make that practice illegal, but that happened many months ago. Will my right hon. Friend the Minister examine implementing the 2002 Act, because the constituents whom we have told that that battle has been won cannot understand why they are still being exploited through the nominated insurance wheeze?",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,30,housing,579
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],361,Matthew Green,LibDem,False,"This has been a good debate, and I shall try to be positive. I usually try to find solutions and outcomes rather than just discussing problems-I leave that to the Tories. First, I shall consider low-demand housing areas and market renewal. Liverpool is a growing success story. It is classified as a low-demand area, although in parts of Liverpool house prices are rising faster than in any other part of the country. When research was conducted in Liverpool about what people look for when they buy a house, the researchers quickly discovered that the last thing people look for is the house itself. People are far more interested in the area in which a house is located and, more importantly, how close services are. People with children look for a good school while the elderly or infirm look for local health services-the important factor is the neighbourhood area. The approach in Liverpool has been to recognise that a city is more than just houses; it is a collection of neighbourhoods. One renews housing in a given area by making each neighbourhood fit for purpose, and hon. Members have already touched on that point. Secondly, the researchers realised that one problem with low-demand housing areas is their image, particularly the image of Liverpool. Considerable work has been done on improving that-successfully, in that the city has been designated European capital of culture 2008. That has contributed to a renewal in the housing market: unwanted houses have been cleared and new neighbourhoods have been set up, with the effect that house prices are increasing faster than the national average. Both Liverpool and Manchester have set clear targets for expanding their populations, which had been in decline. They look to take 100,000 more people between them in the next 15 years. That is important, because bringing people back into the cities will reduce the pressure on the green belt. That has an impact well beyond the economic well-being of Liverpool and the surrounding areas. When success occurs as a result of vigorous local council activity, particularly that of Councillor Richard Kemp, the lead on housing, who is involved with Local Government Association housing issues as a result of his success there, as well as-I do not deny it-help from the Government, it behoves us all to find out how it can be helped to happen in other parts of the country. Renovation has been mentioned. When somebody renovates an existing property, he has to pay VAT on the products used, whereas if he builds a house anew, he does not. It would be perfectly possible, under European Union regulations, to equalise the VAT, reducing it for renovations-perhaps to about 6 per cent.-and introducing it for new build. That would not increase the amount taken out of the housing market by VAT, but would remove the disincentive to renovate properties and to reuse them. It would also help to reduce pressure on the green belt, something that many of us would welcome. The biggest issue for the housing market in many areas is affordability. The problem affects not just London and the south-east, but rural areas, particularly my constituency. Just over a year ago, I became the owner of a small two-and-a-half-bedroom cottage, right at the limit of what I could afford on an MP's salary: in Shropshire, that is an outstandingly good salary; it may not be the case in London, but in Shropshire, an MP is among the highest-paid people in the county. I could just afford to get into the housing market on a maximum mortgage on that cottage. One year later, I could not have afforded that same property. House prices in my constituency are driven by people retiring from London and the south-east, selling properties for Â£300,000 or Â£400,000 and saying, "" What a lovely cottage, we'll buy it for a quarter of a million pounds."" The effect is that local people, for whom Â£15,000 a year is a good salary, have no chance of getting on to the property ladder. We need to make houses affordable to live in, by considering building regulations. Much more could be done to ensure that homes are built to zero or near-zero energy standards. We heard about BedZED. I have helped to initiate a similar scheme in my constituency called the Craven Arms sustainable community. It is a live-work scheme and uses near-zero energy. It maximises daylight, just as BedZED does. It also minimises the use of energy, and that which it does use comes from green sources. Much can be done to minimise water usage. I recently opened the show home of the Wintles development in Bishop's Castle: it is an entirely private sector-driven eco-development that I hope will be very successful. The Government should be doing much, such as using building regulations, to make such houses standard. The CASCOM project estimates that building such houses, which look like conventional houses-they do not look odd at all-will cost only Â£3,000 or Â£4,000 more for each three-bedroom property than it would cost to build a conventional house. That is without the mass market: if more homes were built to those standards, that cost would come down. The argument against eco-standard housing, which is that it will cost too much, is frankly wrong. I urge the Minister seriously to consider introducing such regulations. The Minister should talk to other Ministers about putting combined heat and power into properties. There have been improvements in boilers, and new condensing boilers will be introduced in 18 months. We are only a few years away from seeing combined domestic heat and power become commercially viable in properties. That, combined with net metering, would maximise energy use in the 70 per cent. of homes that are on natural gas. In 15 years, we could replace nuclear energy with the electricity produced through domestic combined heat and power by replacing boilers. We should realise that vision. It would have a dramatic impact on the affordability of homes, because it would seriously reduce the cost of heating and lighting homes. If we allowed net metering, we would also make photovoltaics and other forms of green energy more affordable. They are currently not affordable but are made because of a commitment to the cause of green energy. They would be more commercially viable. We are short of homes to rent because we have not built enough and the right-to-buy scheme decimated housing stocks in areas where demand was highest. They have virtually all gone, not just in London but in rural areas, where there are desirable blocks of four and eight houses. Because of the right to buy, virtually no social homes are left in large parts of my constituency, unless they have registered social landlords. The Government have made some welcome changes, but they should let local councils decide whether there should be subsidy on right to buy. Local councils are best placed to decide what effects right to buy has had in their areas. In some areas, we should encourage right to buy, such as mixed-tenure estates that have not been fully developed. In other areas-not just London and the south-east-the scheme has decimated the housing stock. The Minister should consider making councils' ability to choose where right to buy happens more flexible. We should get people on the housing ladder. We need to give tenants, either of council properties or registered social landlords, the right to invest. That is the equivalent of shared equity, which currently happens where a set of properties is developed as such. I recommend that any council tenant or registered social landlord tenant should have the right to buy a proportion of their property-but not the whole lot. They would pay part rent, part equity and when they wanted to move on, they would sell either to the council or the RSL. That would allow them to keep pace with the housing ladder before they get off it without losing such homes from the social sector. Interestingly, the right to invest, which was introduced by the Conservatives in the early 1980s, was dropped because they also introduced the right to buy. Because right to buy was so heavily discounted, everyone took that rather than right to invest. Before the Conservatives start rubbishing it, it is worth remembering it was one of their ideas. We must also look at producing a sector of housing that people own completely, but which stays affordable. One problem with building more starter homes is that they are affordable for the first person, if they are limited to people who live or work locally, but after that they are lost. When they are sold the second time, the price has raced up to the market values. The Minister knows about the south Shropshire scheme, because I have discussed it with him before. It used section 106, the so-called golden share scheme, which allows people to own their properties in their entirety but means that when they come to sell, they are price limited. In effect, people purchase the property at its build price, so land is taken out of the equation. When they come to sell, they can do so only at an agreed growth rate. The Minister should look at that, not least because it could be used in the Thames gateway to solve the problems of key workers, particularly if the Government consider moving away from their preferred option of 30 per cent. affordable housing on sites of 19 houses or more towards a 50 per cent. affordable rate on sites of two or more houses, as has been done. I could say much more. The Government need to look at four areas in the proposed Housing Bill. We will certainly try to bring them in. First, the exemption of student properties or any property containing a student from houses in multiple occupation licensing is unacceptable. Secondly, the Bill provides the ideal opportunity to introduce a tenancy deposit scheme. We will try to do that, but I am glad to hear that the Minister is considering something along those lines. Thirdly, we heard about overcrowding from the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King), and the Bill gives us a good opportunity for a better statutory definition of overcrowding. Finally, the Government have not shown sufficient interest in dealing with the issue of park homes. I have attempted to be positive in covering a range of issues, and I hope that the Minister will respond in a similarly positive light.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,31,housing,1754
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],362,John Hayes,Con,False,"I thank the Minister for his kind words when he welcomed me to my new role. He is a diligent Minister and a decent man. I look forward to exchanging some friendly, and some less friendly, comments over the coming weeks and months. I will not rubbish anything that the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) said. That would be cruel. Politics is about both the positive and the negative. It is about cut and thrust. It is about opposition, attack and defence. He will learn that as he becomes more experienced in the House. The issues that we can deal with first are those on which we agree. The Minister was right to say that the protection of housing for vulnerable people must be a key priority for all parties. He was also right to say that a supply of affordable homes is another key priority. He went on to talk about the effect of antisocial behaviour on the quality of life of people living in some of our most deprived areas, and of the Government's determination to deal with that. He talked about raising the quality of the housing stock, and we would all agree that that is essential. The Minister and other speakers talked about the link between poor housing and poor health. I noted the comments of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King), who made a powerful case. I agreed with her about overcrowding, and I tried to intervene to say so. The most worrying thing is that it is a growing problem in certain areas, and, as she will know, it is concentrated in some of our poorest communities. We are in the ironic position that many large homes in the leafy suburbs are under-populated while crowded homes are concentrated in the poorer areas. The hon. Lady was right to draw attention to that, and I congratulate her on having done so. It is also right to say, as many hon. Members did, that an appropriate balance has to be struck between landlord and tenant. I particularly noted the comments of the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), who made that point forcefully. We look forward to hearing what the Government will say about that in the Housing Bill. These are always difficult areas. There is always a tension between the various interests, but it is appropriate to move forward in the kind of spirit that the hon. Gentleman articulated. We will no doubt discuss that at greater length over the coming weeks and months. Let me start with the negative stuff and then move on to the positive stuff. I do not want to frighten the hon. Member for Ludlow too much, as he is a sensitive soul. I start by putting the matter into context. Homelessness has soared in England by 12,000 since 1997: those are not my figures; they come from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The latest available Government figures show that the number who are unfortunate enough to be in bed-and-breakfast accommodation has trebled under Labour, and that since this Government came to office, completions of new social houses have fallen by about a third. The Government admit that their house-building targets, assessed in 2001, are not being achieved, and that house prices have risen beyond the reach of many households, and we must acknowledge that in some respects-I do not want to overstate the case-there is a real crisis. It is exacerbated by regional and local difficulties, some of which have been elucidated in the debate. The picture is not universal, but in some parts of the country there is a massive problem in terms of the balance between supply and demand, the affordability of houses and the decline of the stock. Against that background, the Government's plans for house building were roundly condemned by the Select Committee. It is worth reminding hon. Members of some of the comments made in the Select Committee report to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks. It stated: "" The impact of such a housing programme""- the Government's scheme to build 200,000 houses- "" on the environment could be unsustainable ... the impact of developing so many homes in the South East, one of the most densely populated regions of Europe, had not been fully assessed."" It continued: "" The additional homes can place excessive demands on the environment leading to the loss of green field sites, excessive pressure on the water supply and other natural resources ... The Government has yet to estimate the cost of providing the transport links, health care, education and all the other facilities which neighbourhoods require."" I note the comments that were made during the debate about the need to balance the demands of the infrastructure with those of housing provision. The report stated: "" The Government's objective to bring down house prices is unlikely to be achieved."" I could go on, but suffice it to say that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: "" If the current situation continues, there will be a property shortfall of more than a million by 2022 ... We estimate that the difference between housing demand and supply will have widened into a yawning gap of 1.1 million homes in England alone by 2022: most of it in London and the South East,"" Housing shortages will most heavily affect the poorest families, who cannot afford to buy houses and have little access to rented accommodation. Since 1997, a sharp increase in the number of homeless households housed in temporary accommodation has become a scandal. Subsidies to providers and consumers of housing have dropped in recent years.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,32,housing,943

I will give way to her in a moment, although I am conscious that time is short. The debate is about both supply and quality, and I am dividing my remarks between those two categories.

There is a way of measuring homelessness and a way of measuring priority homelessness. In fact, as she will know from her close reading of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's statutory homelessness table of August 2003, priority homelessness has risen, as well as homelessness as a whole. The hon. Lady is right to say that the Government have had some success in some of the detail, such as the rough-sleeping initiatives. However, she will also recognise that ongoing difficulties are associated with the inability of people to get into social housing or affordable housing. That is creating massive problems in providing children, families and some of our most vulnerable citizens with the housing that they need.

2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],366,John Hayes,Con,False,"Forgive me for not giving way again, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The hon. Lady made some good points, which I acknowledge to some degree, but time is short, and I want to give the Minister the maximum time to deal with the issues that have been raised. I shall therefore summarise, by identifying several key issues. The key to the market is recognising that high and low demand are two sides of the same coin. Housing markets are dysfunctional in different ways in different areas. As the hon. Members for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) and for Bolton, South-East said, that creates all kinds of social problems and tensions. It is right to say that it is a rural as well as an urban housing issue. I am well aware of that from my own constituency. The first issue that I wish to raise is that of standards. Have we got the criterion for decency right? I suspect that it is inadequate. I am also concerned about policy coherence: have the Government given enough thought to how local authorities will meet their targets? Moreover, in relation to targeting, it is likely that the houses that will be the most difficult to bring up to a decent standard will be those in the poorest communities-the communities that are currently the worst. I am concerned that the Government's strategy will mean that the people in the greatest need will be the last to get help. The Government's plans are not adequate to tackle housing shortages. The Select Committee and the Government's own figures confirm that. Earlier, I discussed homelessness-through you, of course, Mr. Deputy Speaker-with the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow. It is a scandal that 750,000 houses in the UK are currently unoccupied, nearly 20 per cent. of them in the public sector. We must draw attention to that and plan to do something about it. The affordability of housing is a massive problem, which must be addressed. That can be done in a variety of ways, and the Minister should take into account some of the interesting remarks made during the debate. There can be a measure of cross-party agreement on this issue. The concern expressed in this useful debate has been largely non-partisan. The Government have taken some useful steps, but have not yet got us to where we need to be. The Minister, under criticism and scrutiny from me, has another chance, but we will not let him off the hook. To do so would be to fail the House and to fail the people. The Government must do better.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,36,housing,431

2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],368,Keith Hill,Lab,False,"Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am grateful that that permission has been granted. This has been a genuinely interesting and good debate; it is perhaps a happier excursion than my initial appearance in this Chamber. Housing and regeneration, as well as planning, are now genuinely high on the political agenda. Wherever I go, people say that there is a new buzz in the atmosphere, which is a reflection of the new level of resourcing and prioritisation that the Government have given to those areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) remarked upon my smiling visage. I am smiling because this is such a good area in which to be involved. I am sure that he would agree that my smile is more innocent and less sinister than my smile in my previous incarnation as deputy Chief Whip. I hope that I will be able to carry on smiling. I have been reminded again of the great expertise on such matters in this House, especially on the Government Benches. Many issues have been raised, and I shall attempt to deal with as many as I can, as systematically as possible. I give the undertaking that I shall write to my hon. Friends and other hon. Members in response to the specific questions that they have raised, including specific issues of constituency concern. The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) made some thoughtful points at the end of his speech, which I shall consider carefully-although he was a little more vigorous at the beginning of his speech. I would make the point that homelessness remains considerably lower now that it was in the Tory years of the early 1990s. On the question of families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, we are now on target to ensure that no family will spend more than six weeks in bed and breakfast by next spring. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) pointed out, we have cut rough sleeping by more than two thirds since 1997. We had more housing completions in the year 2002 than we did in 1980 or 1990-both of which, if I am not mistaken, were years of Conservative Administration. Indeed, we have had more housing completions in 2002 than in the year 2000. We inherited, as my colleagues pointed out, a colossal Â£19 billion backlog in arrears for the refurbishment, modernisation and repair of social housing. Already, we have brought 1 million social homes up to the standards of the decent homes target. Another half a million will follow by spring 2004. In an achievement that in 1997 many of us would have thought impossible, we are on target for all homes to meet the decent homes standard by 2010.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,38,housing,463
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],369,John Hayes,Con,False,"I know that the Minister is scrupulous about being accurate with the House, and I have his Department's figures. In the first quarter of 1997, the number of those living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation was 4,100. In the first quarter of 2003, it was 12,200. That seems to me to be a rise by any standards.",42030,['Deputy Prime Minister'],Housing,1,39,housing,55
2003-11-13,Housing [Deputy Prime Minister],370,Keith Hill,Lab,False,"If the hon. Gentleman studies the overall figures for homelessness from the early 1990s onwards, he will find that the figure in this country remains considerably lower now than it was in the Tory years of the early 1990s. I ought not to dwell on the evidence of the Government's success in this area, but I cannot resist it. In the next three years we shall be spending Â£5 billion on housing: that is double the level of investment in housing that we inherited from the Conservatives. We shall spend Â£22 billion on communities and housing during the next three years, which is an increase of 40 per cent. on current figures. I would point out that I have not even mentioned negative equity; I have not breathed a word on the subject. However, if the hon. Gentleman wants to play the numbers game, I am more than happy to join in. I do not suppose that this is the last time we shall dance a tango on this subject. In the brief time remaining, I shall turn to the issues raised by my hon. Friends and other hon. Members in the course of the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow raised the issue of key worker housing. Under the starter homes initiative, 9,000 key workers-such as nurses, teachers and police officers-will own affordable homes by the next spring, and 5,000 already do. We are committing a further Â£1 billion to that programme during the next two years, and we are working with other Departments to ensure that further large numbers of key workers in our essential services go into home ownership. My hon. Friend also asked about the decent homes target, and I have talked about our performance in general, but as she asked about Tower Hamlets, I shall add that I am aware that Tower Hamlets has placed a bid under ALMO 3-the third round of arm's-length management ownership. We are investing a further Â£685 million of new private finance initiative credits to improve local authority housing. In addition to the Â£760 million already allocated, we are providing almost Â£2 billion for ALMOs over the next three years, which is a massive increase compared with the Â£460 million allocated in the 2000 spending review. Our new rate of funding improvements in the management and maintenance of council stock will mean that support will be Â£500 million higher in 2005 than would have been the case without that additional investment. Many hon. Members mentioned tenancy deposit schemes. I agree that we cannot ignore that issue, but it needs to be considered in the context of the wider relationship between landlord and tenant. We have just received the Law Commission proposals on housing tenure, and my officials and I are now considering the recommendations in detail. I remain of the view that a tenancy deposit scheme can best be considered as part of the Law Commission's recommendations on a written agreement between landlord and tenant, but we will continue to take the representations of colleagues into consideration. My hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) raised many issues, including that of empty homes. He spoke about his earlier proposals for data exchange between authorities, and I am aware of the helpful LAWN scheme in London. In various parts of the country, especially London, choice-based lettings are providing a genuinely customer-oriented service to people who want to move within social housing. My hon. Friend mentioned the renovation of private sector homes, and 200,000 private sector homes will be brought up to the decent homes target by next spring. I was grateful for my hon. Friend's support for the market renewal of the north Staffordshire pathfinder. Our investment over the next three years in the pathfinders will be Â£500 million, but he is right that this is not only about the physical regeneration of areas, but about uplift and renewal in skills. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East also mentioned pathfinders, and it is worth remembering that the nine pathfinders cover some 50 per cent. of the areas identified as experiencing market failure. The Â£500 million is already being used for good purposes, and hon. Members will be aware that we recently announced Â£125 million for the Manchester and Salford pathfinder. My hon. Friend made an acute point about the character of that regeneration. Last Thursday I visited Liverpool and the Bootle part of the projected Merseyside pathfinder, and people were saying that the scheme was not solely about the demolition of properties, despite the fact that it is easy to imagine that that would be the primary function of dealing with market failure. The Merseyside pathfinder proposes to demolish 20,000 properties, but intends to build 18,000 properties as well. It is about the revitalisation of communities and town centres, and of business opportunities in those places. My hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) talked about low-cost and shared home ownership, and her concerns about our policy on the right to buy. We have met separately. and I am sympathetic to her proposals. The Government remain wedded to the principle of a right to buy, and we have no intention of revoking that principle. However, we have anxieties about opportunistic and commercial exploitation of that in certain areas. We know that, in London especially, there have recently been many improper purchases under the right to buy, and we are determined to remedy that aspect of the policy. I shall conclude my remarks at that point and, as I said earlier, I undertake to write to hon.

Members, it is not a debate about dry policy but a reality with which I come face to face each week through the lives of my constituents. The old and the young, families and the disabled-most of them are women-all come to my advice surgeries with the problems of homelessness. First, I pay tribute to the Government for their record in tackling the problem. We used to have a huge problem with people sleeping rough, particularly in this city. As I recall it, when the Conservative party was in government, it complained about the problem only when Ministers tripped over people sleeping rough on the pavements during ministerial visits to the opera. Chronic homelessness and overcrowding in the inner cities led to the resurgence of TB. We also saw the refusal to recognise the problems of the young homeless-of 16 and 17-year-olds-and of the single homeless, and the growth of an army of homeless women and children living in bed-and-breakfast hostels across the country. During the nine years of Labour government we have seen the virtual elimination of rough sleeping, a reduction of 70 per cent. in the number of homeless families and an improvement in the rights of homeless people, especially for the many women who are forced into homelessness as a result of domestic violence. We have also seen a reduction in homeless acceptances by local authorities. The crude measure of homelessness has dropped to its lowest level since the early 1980s. In the Green Paper â€œEvery Child Mattersâ€ and in the â€œBreaking the Cycleâ€ report on social exclusion, the Government recognised for the first time the disastrous social impact of homelessness. Although I shall listen with great interest to what Conservative Members have to say, for all who have had to deal with the Conservative party either in central Government or local government, the tag â€œcompassionate conservatismâ€ rings very hollow when it comes to housing the homeless. However, despite the many achievements of the Government in tackling homelessness, I still see too much of it.",44860,[],Housing,0,1,housing,359

2006-10-17,Housing,369,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"The figures for housing completions are a matter of record, and we all know what they are. However, I draw from two experiences. The first was the leader of an inner London council having to house destitute people under a Conservative Government who were vicious in their determination to try to ignore the plight of the homeless. The other is having to deal with a Conservative-controlled council that is equally brutal in how it deals with a number of my homeless constituents. It is a matter of recognising housing need and of properly assessing and meeting it. The Labour party, in government and in local authorities, has a record that the Conservatives could never hope to match, much less beat. As I said, however, despite the Government's many achievements in tackling homelessness, I still see too much of it. Not only that, the homeless people that I see are often the most vulnerable and the most in need of support; the very people whom I would expect to be helped by the state. Homelessness may have reduced, but it has intensified in nature. I shall deal with four particular issues. I know that some of my hon. Friends wish to raise other concerns, so I shall not stray on to that territory. The first is the need to get families with children out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation; the current rules must be tightened. Another is to stop councils making the unacceptable decision that people intentionally have made themselves homeless, and especially to ensure that a proper assessment is made of vulnerability among adults. The third is to stop diverting the homeless into private sector accommodation that is often completely inappropriate to their needs. The last is to end the single room rent. Underlying all that is the need for more social housing to rent. I welcome the recommendations of the Select Committee, as well as the commitment by the Chancellor to increase spending, which he sees as a key part of the spending review. I start with getting families out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We have seen a welcome reduction of 80 per cent. in the overall numbers since March 2002. Government guidance is that bed-and-breakfast accommodation should be used to accommodate families with children only as a last resort and only for six weeks. Although it might be possible for some councils to interpret that in a reasonable fashion, that is not the case in my constituency. My understanding of â€œlast resortâ€ or â€œemergencyâ€ is that someone's house has burned down, or that everything else has been tried and failed. Yet in Northampton, I find that the threat of bed and breakfast seems to be used routinely to deter people from applying for social housing, and it is still used routinely for families who face what might be termed predictable homelessness; families who have been served with notices to quit their private sector rented accommodation because the landlord wants to sell the property, or lone parents with children who are evicted by grandparents or friends who have given a month's notice of their impending homelessness and who have time to find a more acceptable alternative. I shall give some examples of what is meant by bed and breakfast. In one instance, a young lone parent in my constituency was placed in a bed-and-breakfast hostel where, as she complained to me, a relative of the owner rifled through her belongings. She felt unsafe and left, and was promptly branded as being intentionally homeless; she was therefore refused further help with housing. She had suffered a compound series of issues in her previous life, so by any reasonable standard she should have been regarded as vulnerable and in priority need. It would be hard to interpret what had happened to her as intentional. Another example was of someone being refused housing by a local authority but being helped by social services; there was a particular need to ensure parity of treatment between the two groups. A Muslim widow with seven children was placed in a bed-and-breakfast hostel that had no cooking facilities. Because of that restriction, she had to walk across town each day to a community centre in order to cook a meal for her children and then walk back with the cooked meal. Finally, only last weekend a woman with three children came to my advice surgery. She was being evicted by her landlord because he wanted to sell the property. She had nowhere to live and went to the local council, which said that she would have to come back on the day of the eviction and that they would probably put her in bed-and-breakfast accommodation in a town about 20 miles away. Not only would that have made it virtually impossible to sort out her accommodation needs, it would mean disruption for the children; they would not receive schooling and they would also lose their friends. When she was eventually placed in a single bed-and-breakfast room in a hostel in Northampton, she saw it as a real concession; never mind that that she was in a bed and breakfast, with all its attendant difficulties. Frankly, that is being bullied. The Government have to be much more specific about the circumstances in which families with children are placed in bed and breakfast, and about the facilities that they should have. They should ensure that the rules apply equally to families placed in accommodation by the housing authority under homelessness legislation and those placed in hostel accommodation by social services under the Children Act 1989. By whichever route they get there, the same standards should apply. If it is not possible to be more specific about the circumstances, the Government should take the bold step of completely ruling out bed-and-breakfast accommodation for families. I realise the difficulties that that would create, but we cannot have families with children being placed in unacceptable accommodation. That is unacceptable, as is the default route whereby, instead of being dealt with under homelessness legislation, those concerned are dealt with by social services under the Children Act; that is because they do not have the same safeguards. Although the pressure on the numbers of families in bed and breakfasts is welcome, it is one of the causes of the dramatic increase in families in temporary accommodation. In my own region of the east midlands, the numbers have more than doubled since 1997, and the evidence from Shelter on the position of those families is acute. As some of my colleagues want to speak about that, I will leave further description of that problem to them.",44860,[],Housing,0,3,housing,1099
2006-10-17,Housing,370,Andrew Love,Lab,False,"Does my hon. Friend agree that those who suggest that much of temporary accommodation is of good quality are wrong?

Members, is that the least good accommodation is generally used for temporary accommodation and most people's experience is very negative.",44860,[],Housing,0,4,housing,53
2006-10-17,Housing,371,Sally Keeble,Lab,False,"I completely agree. The problem of instability is profound and has a huge impact on families. A further issue is that of decision making in terms of intentionality and the difficulty that homeless people have challenging those decisions. For example, there is a woman whose case I have already raised with the Minister's Department-I have not yet had a reply-who is disabled, has mental health issues and is a former care leaver who walks with difficulty and uses crutches. She was judged to be intentionally homeless because of an eviction for rent arrears, which she says was due to problems with housing benefit. I have been through the circumstances carefully with her and it seems that her explanation is entirely credible. She is presently living in a privately rented room above a pub. The landlord wants to evict her not, I hasten to say, because of problems with the rent, but for quite different reasons. Her single room is up several flights of stairs and, bearing in mind she walks with crutches, there is no lift and the kitchen is down a flight of stairs, with the toilet and bathroom-her washing facilities-up another fight of stairs. In order to avoid going up and down to the kitchen, she eats what she is able to cook in her room, which is not very healthy. The problems of getting to the toilet are more acute-I will not go into the details out of respect for her privacy. This woman has survived a pretty horrendous time in and out of care and subsequently a number of other difficult circumstances in her life, yet she is coping remarkably well. I am surprised that she copes at all, despite the fact she feels very depressed about the conditions in which she is forced to live. There are, of course, procedures that should have ensured that that woman was not left in that position. She is supported by a number of organisations so it is not just me who has heard her story. It is hard for someone in her position to challenge the local authority, especially when there is no one to take on housing cases funded by legal aid in Northampton and decisions simply go unchallenged. Intentionality officially accounts for just under 10 per cent. of homelessness refusals, but those cases often involve the most vulnerable people who have difficultly challenging flawed or inconsistent decisions. A great deal more work needs to be done to ensure that there is consistency within the decision making process and that decisions are taken properly. The vulnerability of people should be properly assessed and they should be given a real opportunity to challenge decisions. That process might already appear to exist on paper, but in reality, certainly for many of my constituents, it simply does not happen. I would also like to refer to the diversion of homeless families into private sector accommodation. I have pressed the Government on that a number of times because it is a real problem for my constituents. Although the Government's intentions are clear, they are not being translated into action on the ground. I still find that constituents who face homelessness are encouraged to go into private sector housing and claim housing benefit before their vulnerability is assessed, instead of making a homeless application. A young couple came to see me who were homeless and vulnerable; the mother of a former care leaver and a young man evicted by his mother with a young child and a second expected. They were diverted away from making a homelessness application towards a private sector tenancy, which they ultimately took. When I last heard from them they were on their second private sector tenancy and facing difficulties because they could only get six-month tenancies and therefore have to keep moving. Another woman was diverted away from making a homelessness application despite being a victim of domestic violence. She was unable to manage the rent for a private sector tenancy-housing benefit does not now routinely cover private sector rents-fell into debt, was evicted for non-payment of rent, and was judged to be intentionally homeless because of the eviction for rent arrears. She was then refused further help. Some of my constituents who are now routinely caught in that situation are paying Â£50 per month and more on top of their housing benefit for their private rented accommodation with no security of tenure beyond six months. People who are forced to move from one short tenancy to another find it difficult to get work and finding that extra money out of benefits it very difficult. My constituency has very high levels of employment, including among women, so it is not an issue about people wanting to work. If people cannot work it is because of the practical difficulties in their way. The single room rent means that single people under the age of 25 can only claim housing benefit for a single room. That is perhaps the last matter hanging over from the Conservative Government and is long overdue for change. Research from the Department for Work and Pensions shows that 87 per cent. of all single room rent claimants face a shortfall because of the low level at which the single room rent is paid, usually around Â£35 per week. I wish to pay tribute to the YMCA in Northampton for its outstanding work on that and other issues relating to single homeless people in the town. I am concerned about the possibility of funding cuts to what is a life-line service for many young people in my constituency. Not only is the single room rent forcing young people into debt, it is perpetuating the continuation of a sub-standard category of housing that should have disappeared long ago. A home shared by friends is a far cry from a property where each room houses a different person. There are a group of private sector landlords who subdivide and let their properties to maximise their housing benefit receipts: a type of benefit farming that traps the most vulnerable and marginalised in the worst housing whether they are young, single people or homeless families. A change in the rules on the single room rent would help prevent at least part of that. This debate comes 40 years after the historic screening of â€œCathy Come Homeâ€, which led to establishment of Shelter, and its outstanding campaign on behalf of homeless people. This Government have worked closely with Shelter on many housing issues and have transformed the rights and realities for many families at the bottom of the housing ladder. Despite the great progress that has been made under this Government, my judgment is that a lot of â€œCathysâ€ are still out there somewhere with their children, drifting in and out of bed and breakfasts, temporary accommodation and the occasional private sector tenancy. Those who are more resilient have managed to get a home of their own, but for the most vulnerable, there are still wide holes in the safety net and I ask the Minister to ensure that they are closed so that all of the â€œCathysâ€ can finally come home.",44860,[],Housing,0,5,housing,1192
2006-10-17,Housing,372,Andrew George,LibDem,False,"I congratulate the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing this important debate. While I respect her temptation to take a side swipe at the Tories-we can all respect that-I think that homeless people are better served by raising this debate above the tiresome, tribal debates and squabbles that often take place; homeless people deserve that. I also entirely agree with the hon. Lady's concluding remarks regarding the single room rent. From my own experience of my west Cornwall and Isles of Scilly constituency of St. Ives, I know that there is a significant problem with the setting of local reference rents generally. Because of the methodology used, they are often set significantly below the rate that the private sector charges for properties, certainly in my area. That leaves many people who are on low incomes, earning and non-earning, facing a significant shortfall between the housing benefit that they receive and the rent that they are charged, in an environment in which private rented accommodation especially is scarce and extortionately expensive compared with incomes, at least in my area, which has the lowest incomes in the country. The debate is about homelessness and I want to deal with two matters. One relates to the gathering of the data-the basis on which we take decisions or Government policy is decided. I had an exchange of letters with the Minister for Housing and Planning a year ago, querying the figures given by the Government at that stage. The theme that I want to develop and the question that I want to ask is whether the Government believe that homelessness is the result of dysfunctional people who have simply failed themselves and that accommodation does exist, or whether there is a malfunctioning of the housing system and the housing market, which I argue is more likely, particularly in an area such as my own. The impression given, certainly in the exchange that I have had with Ministers, is that homelessness is a problem of data collection and definition. There is a rather patronising centralist view that somehow those stakeholders out in the sticks are not competent enough to establish and operate strategies to deal with the problems. All the correspondence and dialogue that I have had points to a failure of the Department, whether Ministers or officials, to accept that there might be a malfunctioning of the housing system and the housing market that results in pressures throughout the system such that those who are dropping out at the end are in fact properly functioning people who simply cannot be housed because insufficient housing is available for them and their circumstances are not a result of a failure in themselves. In commenting on this issue, especially with regard to my constituency, I should congratulate a large number of voluntary sector projects in particular. One in which I was involved from the very early stages is called Breadline; it is just up the road from me in Bread street in Penzance. Since 1986, that project has provided very significant help to homeless people and unemployed people in the Penwith area. The YMCA has some hostel accommodation, particularly for younger single people, in the Penwith area. Penwith Housing Concern provides support, advice and counselling, particularly for those who have suffered substance and alcohol misuse. The Salvation Army undertakes its own quarterly count and provides us with extremely helpful figures on the people with whom it makes contact and provides support for, and works with other agencies in a very professional manner in the Penwith area. It has recently secured another hostel to assist and relieve the problem locally. Of course, there is also Shelter, with which I was involved before I was elected as an MP, and many other organisations. There are also the local authority professionals in this sphere, for whom I have a very high regard as well. In setting the backdrop to my comments on this issue, I should say that I undertook a survey of estate agents in March/April last year, about 18 months ago. I asked very simple straightforward questions regarding how properties had been sold, to whom they had been sold and the prices and the estate agents' estimates, as they are in the best position to give estimates, of the change in house prices and the change in the nature of the market. I found that, in the whole of west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, twice as many properties were sold to second-home buyers as to first-time buyers. People locally will be not surprised at that; in fact, they will be surprised that first-time buyers are able to buy and get that toehold in the market at all, given the house prices. I will not bore hon. Members with statistics-those can be trotted out on many occasions and I can supply them to people-but certainly the average house price in the area vastly outstrips local wages. According to one's source, the average house price is anything from seven to 10 or 12 times local wages. That is not a surprise and it is not a surprise that large numbers of properties are purchased for recreational and investment purposes by people who want to enjoy them as holiday accommodation and for their own leisure and investment. I am not involved and nor am I interested in the politics of envy. People are of course entitled to buy properties for recreational and investment purposes if that is their desire. However, we need to consider a range of policy issues relating to the impact that that is having and whether we need to change policy, particularly in the area of planning use class orders, to constrain the numbers of properties that can be purchased and converted from permanent to non-permanent residency. Hon. Members, including you, Mr. Taylor, may be asking yourselves, â€œWell, what has second-home ownership to do with homelessness?â€ This is the very point that I want to make. Second-home ownership is having a very direct effect in this regard. If the market is significantly influenced by extremely wealthy people-wealthy compared with locals-who can intervene in the market and in fact set the whole tone of it, and if the price regime is largely generated or led by that development, it will inevitably have an impact on families who, 20 or 30 years ago, might have anticipated that they would have a chance of getting into the market. They now cannot and they are looking for the very scarce accommodation available through either the public or the private sector for rent. Particularly in the private sector, such accommodation is not only scarce but extortionate in price. Further to the survey that I undertook last year, I undertook a survey this summer and found that five times as many properties were sold to second-home buyers as to first-time buyers. That is just 18 months after my original survey. Again, the findings are not a surprise. In St. Ives, for example, an estate agent told me that 60 per cent. of properties were sold to second-home buyers and 0 per cent. to locals. Many people will not be surprised by that outcome, but perhaps it is a surprise and very disturbing to people here to hear that that is the dysfunctional way in which the housing market operates in my area. Down on the Lizard peninsula, an estate agent told me that 65 per cent. of properties were sold to second-home buyers and 0 per cent. to locals. I do not know whether you can still hear me, Mr. Taylor, given the intervention from a phantom driller off to my right-that is not a political statement. I am trying to show a significant connection, relating to how the housing market works for thousands of people, who are unable to express their demand, desire and need for housing in the market place, as they might well have been able to a generation ago, even in an area as difficult as Cornwall.",44860,[],Housing,0,6,housing,1332
2006-10-17,Housing,373,Andrew Love,Lab,False,"Was not one of the findings of the Affordable Rural Housing Commission that the activities in question were localised in very small areas in the south-west? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting, as a consequence, that we should intervene in the market place to restrain, somehow, the level of activity in the housing market?",44860,[],Housing,0,7,housing,53
2006-10-17,Housing,374,Andrew George,LibDem,False,"Absolutely. I do not argue that the problem is a nationwide one. It is clearly localised to Cornwall, parts of south-west England and Norfolk, the Lake district, Somerset and some other places. It is not inconceivable, and it would certainly be acceptable in my view, for the Government to provide local authorities with the tools, if they wanted to use them. It would be appropriate only in areas such as those I have described, where second-home purchases have a detrimental impact not only on the housing market but on such matters as community infrastructure and the viability of schools. There is clearly an opportunity, as the Affordable Rural Housing Commission suggested in its report, not for the Government to intervene themselves but for them to provide local authorities with the tools to do so where appropriate. In view of the time, I want to return to the issue of homelessness, and to provide a backdrop to show why, surprising as it may appear, homelessness, which is assumed to be an urban phenomenon affecting only metropolitan and inner-city areas, has significantly affected an area such as mine in west Cornwall for the past 10 to 20 years. It has certainly not gone away. Our problem is, first, that the Government do not accept the level and seriousness of the problem in my area. In Penwith alone-my constituency covers most of Kerrier, Penwith and, of course, the Isles of Scilly-the count on 14 and 15 March last year demonstrated that there were six rough sleepers in Penwith district. It is the smallest by far of the six districts in Cornwall. The figure for Cornwall as a whole was 11. That is an absurd figure. Anyone who works in the relevant policy sphere will know that that does not at all reflect the seriousness of the problem in the area. The figures that the Salvation Army gave me for that period suggest that the number was in the region of 40. Some of the latest figures suggest that the number remains the same. The official figures that I have had most recently from Penwith district council, despite tremendous efforts by the district and by other stakeholders working together to bear down on the problem, show eight rough sleepers now in the district. Transient people coming to the end of the line are an issue. The district has the image of a place to which people can escape, and that is a theme that certainly has an effect in an area such as my own. However, we also generate a significant amount of indigenous homelessness, and the Government need to take that fact on board. The ministerial response to me on this matter suggested that the reason for the relevant figure was a problem with the statistical measures that were used, or a problem with Penwith district council and its manner of addressing the problem. I was told that officers from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister came down and spoke to local stakeholders, and suggested ways to tackle the problem. All those measures were already in place in the area. There are also 65 people in bed and breakfast. Those are single people, not families. Alternative hostel accommodation is being provided for families in my area. There is a significant problem in the area, and the Government do not seem to want to accept that it is a problem. I believe that they view it as a matter of the statistical count, and of the homeless people themselves, rather than as the product of a dysfunctional, malfunctioning housing market in which pressure higher up leads inevitably to unbearable pressure further down the housing supply chain, so that large numbers of people are homeless in areas such as mine. Those areas need their problems addressed. I hope that the Minister will accept that what I have outlined is not simply a statistical exercise, but is an issue that must be related to the working of the whole housing market. Several hon.

I am glad that she pointed out how much has changed and the improvements that have been made, although there is still much more that we can do. I want to discuss that in the brief time that I have. I took an interest in this issue because, after the 2005 general election, I was challenged, as I often am, by BBC Radio Norfolk, to say what I was doing about homelessness. I held my hand up and said, â€œWell, not a lot, really,â€ but I knew then that I had better do something about it, and my researcher and I set to work in the Norwich area to find out how homelessness was created. We visited rough sleepers, soup kitchens, drug counsellors, housing officers and charity chief executives, and managed to get them all together in a room. They were all very well at telling me individually how well they were behaving, but they did not seem to know each other or work together very creatively. That was the lesson that I came away with after my initial six months of study; they really ought to work together. We need a whole city programme in which that happens, and we need to be radical about looking after homeless people. There is a lot of confusion among the service users, who have been given little help or information by statutory bodies, and who are sent from one charity to another and one hostel to another. There is no standard process for them to follow, and it is no wonder that they fall through the net; in actuality there is no net. There is no way of tracking an individual's progress through the system and no uniform method of assessment and referral. It is difficult to get information about where to go. There is no uniform assessment of needs at all. My young researcher asked why there was not a website in the city of Norwich, which has had a proud record on housing for years. I know that not everyone uses websites, but that would at least be a slightly creative thing to do in this day and age to enable people to see which places were or were not full. I think that that will happen now. I have been through all the statistics and have found out that the number of households in temporary accommodation in the eastern region rose by 171 per cent. between 1997 and 2005. I always can be suspicious of statistics and figures, but that one is being heavily quoted, and perhaps the Minister would look into it. The issue of housing-the lack of affordable and social housing that affects families across the board, from the homeless to first-time buyers and others-has already been covered in the debate. I know that the Government are making efforts to increase affordable housing, and I welcome that. The right to buy has crippled the housing stock in Norwich. Both Norwich MPs get many visits on the subject. Nearly half of every surgery is taken up by people who cannot find a home and do not understand why there are empty homes in the city of Norwich that they cannot get into. Some of those people would be quite prepared to go into the houses and decorate them, but there is always some pathetic excuse as to why they cannot use houses that have been empty for a few months or so. That is one problem with the affordable housing issue. As an aside I ask this: when we do build houses, could we please think about the environment and climate change? Also, having a bit of photovoltaics around would not do any harm. We could combine the problems. The second prong of homelessness has not been touched on today, so I shall spend a minute on that. I want to lubricate the system by which people who are registered as being homeless can be helped. We cannot immediately put people into homes because the homes are not there; I want to address the issue of how assessments are made as to whether people have made themselves homeless. Under section 191 of the Housing Act 1996 the local authority must determine if an applicant is intentionally homeless. The Department for Communities and Local Government guidelines on homelessness say that an applicant is intentionally homeless if they have deliberately done or failed to do something which has caused them to be homeless. That leaves little room for the interpretation of individual circumstances. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North has illustrated one or two cases, and I will give another. She referred to â€œCathy Come Homeâ€; those were the days. Back then, everybody had to watch because there were only two channels, BBC and ITV. My goodness, those were the days; we had to watch political history unfolding in front of our eyes on television rather than skipping and floating around 50 different channels. I have a young male constituent who suffers from depression, which is common in people who are homeless. Mental health problems occur much more frequently than in the days of â€œCathy Come Homeâ€. My constituent lived in private rented accommodation and had problems managing his money, which is not particularly abnormal; it happens. He got into rent arrears and lost his tenancy, and he was classified as intentionally homeless. The stringent interpretation of the priority need legislation is leaving many vulnerable people homeless who really should not be and who need our help. The system has to help them. My constituent found it difficult to get local people to take his problem seriously. Legislation and the filling in of forms got in his way, as he found that incompatible with his particular problems. I went round and talked to people about the paper-based medical assessments, which people have to fill in. A general practitioner's word is not good enough; a medical assessment form has to be filled in. I met the Norfolk and Waveney mental health partnership homeless mentally ill outreach team-there's a mouthful-who told me that the council in the eastern region refused evidence of an applicant's doctor or support workers in favour of these paper-based medical reports. The council relies heavily on the type of medication and dosage in making a final assessment of a person's condition and, therefore, whether they are in priority need. There is a world-class agency in Norwich called Julian Housing Support, which gives amazing housing support for people with mental health problems. That organisation says that it is necessary to assess people as individuals rather than through a strict medical model that fails to take into account a person's choice to decline medication, and other factors. People with mental illnesses frequently do not take their medication or do what their doctors tell them. Gosh, does anybody in the Chamber do everything that their doctor tells them? I certainly hope not. I have tabled parliamentary questions on this issue, and was told that it is for a local authority to decide which services to use, and the Department recommends certain agencies as being useful. In friendship, I say to the Minister that we need high-quality initial decision making about individuals. Is the Department prepared to commission research into the quality of these paper-based assessments and withdraw support if they are found wanting? I believe that some of them will be found wanting, and that there may be other ways to get the necessary information. We know that because of the nature of homelessness, many people find themselves in the same situation on a regular basis. Drug and alcohol dependencies are much more frequent than they were 40 or so years ago. Mental health problems and drug and alcohol dependency mean that there is a whole new problem, which needs to be handled in a new way because of the vulnerability of the people concerned. I am pleased that Norwich city council now has a full-time private sector facilitator to help people to get into private accommodation, and I congratulate the council on that. I also congratulate the landlords in Norwich on trying to help out. However, we should not spend all our time helping private landlords; we should find other solutions to help the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. I shall finish by talking about hostels and the problems with them. They are always full, there is no move-on accommodation, the individuals who stay in them become institutionalised, and rough sleepers cannot get a foot on the ladder of rehabilitation. I have talked to Norfolk Supporting People and Norwich city council, which has produced a marvellous document, â€œA Review of Hostels and Supported Housing in the Greater Norwich Housing Sub Regionâ€, for which I have high hopes. We had a meeting, and somebody from the Department came and gave a presentation about the work being done by the Department's hostels capital improvement programme, which helps to create bright, vibrant, positive, modern hostels. Was not the Power Point presentation magnificent? The scheme's mantra, quite rightly, is not more beds, but better beds. Its aim is to make hostels centres of excellence. We need more such programmes to help people, because hostels become full very quickly, and people become institutionalised and cannot move on. We need more of that kind of programme and we need hostels that are supportive and rehabilitative environments in which people can access health and career services and counselling. While the Minister is at it, I wonder if she would give Norwich city council a bit more money. It has good ideas but its homelessness grant is very small.",44860,[],Housing,0,10,housing,1635
2006-10-17,Housing,377,Andrew Love,Lab,False,"I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Taylor, and congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing this important debate. I come to the debate from the perspective of a Member in the capital with all the housing problems we have here, particularly concerning the homeless, but I understand that there are other perspectives and problems. One theme of today's debate is the fact that homelessness is becoming a significant problem in all regions of the country and that we need to deal with it. I congratulate the Government on making homelessness a priority. Others have spoken at length about the rough sleeping initiative, which has been very successful, but no one mentioned the introduction of the strategy for local government on homelessness, which has focused local authorities' attention on the issue and some of the supply steps that they can take to deal with it. We have also had the extension of priority categories-16 and 17-year-olds who are vulnerable and people who come from institutional settings-which has done a great deal to stop people falling through the safety net into rough sleeping.",44860,[],Housing,0,11,housing,188

Friend mentioned vulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds. Does he agree that the work of the foyer movement is doing in relation to housing for vulnerable young people is especially important in this country? Does he share my hope that the Government will reconsider the 16-hour rule which prevents some young people, at the age of 19, in foyers from receiving housing benefit, and which makes them choose between education and somewhere to live?",44860,[],Housing,0,12,housing,92
2006-10-17,Housing,379,Andrew Love,Lab,False,"I agree with all of that. I assume that the Minister will not be able to respond directly on the 16-hour rule. I will add, however, that while the foyer movement is doing an exceptionally good job, there is a real problem with move-on accommodation. That comes back to the homelessness issue. My final point about the Government's initiative is that we should accept the work that is being done to end the use of bed and breakfasts for families. I would, however, concur with those who mentioned the large amount of emerging evidence showing that bed and breakfast is still used for families in the short term. I hope that the Minister will take that issue back to the Department. I want to look now at some of the continuing problems that we have with homelessness. I make no excuse for focusing to some extent on the situation in the capital, where homelessness is still a significant problem. Nationwide, about 100,000 families live in temporary accommodation and something like 116,000 children are particularly affected, according to Shelter. Although I congratulate the Government on setting a target to halve the numbers in temporary accommodation over the next few years, it is a major task, and they need to redouble their efforts to deal with all the issues involved. Let me just mention some of those issues. Others have mentioned the time that people spend in temporary accommodation, and the insecurity and isolation that they experience as a result. There is also the impact on the health of many of those who live in temporary accommodation, and it is mainly children who are affected. Finally, families are continuously moved from one set of temporary accommodation to another, especially in London, and the amount of time that children spend out of school has an impact on their education and their future ability to achieve more as part of the next generation. Those are real concerns, which have been expressed right across the board. I want to echo a question that I raised earlier about the standard of temporary accommodation. We are often told that such accommodation is good quality, and there have undoubtedly been improvements. Indeed, there was some very bad accommodation five or 10 years ago, but things have not improved so much that we cannot still say that many people still live in bad accommodation; indeed, three constituents came to my last surgery to talk specifically about the quality of their accommodation. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North talked in some detail about the emerging problem of the rather over-zealous way in which people attempt to prevent homelessness. In particular, they are using the private rented sector for settled accommodation, but many of the people who are placed in that sector have had dismal and negative experiences of it. It does not seem adequate to the task of providing settled accommodation to put such people back into that sector. When the changes were made to the Housing Bill, mediation was touted as a way forward, and I still accept that 100 per cent., but some local authorities have been rather over-zealous in implementing mediation. It is often used as a weapon to persuade 16 and 17-year-olds whose relationships have broken down to go back into the family or to persuade those in marital situations that have broken down to reunite, when there is no real prospect of securing a settled situation. I am acutely aware of the time, Mr. Taylor, so let me briefly mention solutions. We must press the Minister on this because we are coming round to the comprehensive spending review, which will give us an opportunity to look at solutions. I recognise that the things that the Government are doing will continue to produce improvements and I hope that we will be able to halve the number of people in temporary accommodation over the next few years. However, we all recognise that we need to go further, and that was one of the major recommendations of the Barker review, which the Government set up. The review clearly showed the slump in the provision of new affordable rented accommodation, and steps must be taken to address that problem. The Communities and Local Government Committee, in its recent report, which I hope the Minister and the Department are looking at closely, suggested that there needed to be a significant increase in affordable accommodation. However, it also went further. Some of the resources that are available are spent not only on affordable rented accommodation, but on providing low-cost home ownership. I am very supportive of low-cost home ownership initiatives, and I want to see the 1 million additional home owners the Government have committed themselves to creating, but we must look carefully at the balance of resources between the two issues. I therefore echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), because we need to think seriously about additional resources. The Government have set themselves a priority for housing, and cross-cutting reviews on housing and growth are going on. Given all the concerns that our constituents have expressed to us, let me therefore make a plea to the Government as they undertake that work. The only real solution to the problems of homelessness is additional supply of affordable rented accommodation. I therefore hope that the Minister will respond on that point and, more importantly, take it back for discussion in the Department.",44860,[],Housing,0,13,housing,911
2006-10-17,Housing,380,Andrew Slaughter,Lab,False,"I will, of necessity, be brief, and I think that I can be because I simply want to make one slightly extended point as a trailer to my own debate on the Floor of the House on Friday. Obviously, that debate will be well attended, as most Friday Adjournment debates are, but I shall try to whip up a little more enthusiasm for it. Its subject is the provision of affordable housing in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, about which there are some toe-curling and eye-opening things to be said. Today, however, I start with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) about the provision of genuinely affordable social housing, which primarily means social housing, certainly in London. Of course, there are many other issues around the subject raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), and I pay tribute to her not only for securing the debate, but for the part that she is playing in getting the issues of affordable housing and homelessness higher up the agenda. That is happening thanks not only to the Minister for Housing and Planning and the departmental team, but to a groundswell of support, certainly on the Labour Back Benches. As I said, there are many issues around homelessness, but in the end, the provision of genuine affordable housing must be the key issue, and the case for it is being made. The Select Committee has made the case, as have Shelter and other organisations. Shelter's campaign for an extra 20,000 units of affordable housing should be supported. In London, that would mean that than 15,000 new units of affordable housing were built each year, rather than 9,000, although the Greater London authority says that the figure should be 20,000 units, and that might be right. The Government deserve all credit for taking away the worst excesses of homelessness since 1997. With the effective ending of bed-and-breakfast provision and street homelessness, the worst excesses have gone, but long-term, affordable, permanent housing has been on the decline for many years because of the right to buy and other measures. The problem for the Government is that a lot of affordable housing is not affordable, and they must not be caught out by that trick. Intermediate housing at Â£300,000 and Â£400,000 is not intermediate housing. I fully support intermediate housing where it provides starter homes and takes people out of the rented sector, but I do not support the sort of intermediate housing that is cynically being built under the guise of affordable housing. That is being done primarily by Tory councils, but also by Liberal councils, certainly in London. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) looks sceptical, so he must attend my debate on Friday if he wants to find out more about the subject. He defends his case very well and very smoothly, but I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that if the Government are not careful, they will be taken for a ride on this issue; a smooth ride perhaps, but a ride nevertheless. If we want to tackle the problems of homelessness in London in the long term and to build stable communities, as we did after the first and second world wars, there must be substantial investment in genuinely affordable housing.",44860,[],Housing,0,14,housing,557
2006-10-17,Housing,381,Dan Rogerson,LibDem,False,"I congratulate the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing this valuable debate. I know that she has spent a great deal of time on this issue. She raised important issues, beginning, as she said, with a full-frontal assault on the Conservative party's record on this subject. She is right to point out that the current social housing crisis was started under the right-to-buy scheme when there was not adequate replacement to ensure that we had the necessary housing stock. The current Government have failed to address that since they have been in office. I look forward to hearing more from the Minister on how they are planning to address it. The hon. Member for Northampton, North spoke about the problem of people still being placed in bed and breakfast accommodation, and the effects that that has on them, not just in terms of their immediate surroundings and the pressures and strains that it places on families, but in terms of location. Intentionality is a key issue. When one talks to local authority officers, one finds that they feel under pressure to be as rigorous as possible in the definition of â€œintentionalityâ€.

2006-10-17,Housing,383,Dan Rogerson,LibDem,False,"My hon. Friend makes a very valid point, to which I shall return. When we are considering how local authorities assess homelessness we want a consistent approach: one that consistently reflects the situations that people are experiencing rather than the strictures within which the local authority is working. I agree with the hon. Member for Northampton, North that there is pressure to go into the private rented sector, which undoubtedly has a contribution to make. However, I echo other hon. Members' comments: the approach is not necessarily the one that my party would support. Greater investment in social housing offers far better provision for people's housing needs. She also discussed the single room rent. I hope that the Government will return to that issue. Things have moved on considerably since its introduction, and her party and mine opposed it at that time. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) referred to the situation in our own region of Cornwall, particularly in respect of second homes. I hope that the Minister will update us on the response to the Affordable Rural Housing Commission's proposal, in line with that of my party, to examine planning use categories and to give local authorities in areas where that matter is a problem the chance to deal with it. I hope that there is a contrast with the approach taken by her colleague, the Minister for Housing and Planning, when she was interviewed in the Financial Times not long after the report came out. She basically said that this was not an issue that the Government were interested in tackling. I hope that the approach has moved on a little. The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) referred to the lack of a thorough system of tracking, to be sure of how many people are involved and what the need is. He is right that that could be improved. He also referred to sustainability in housing. When there is investment in new social housing, the fact that sustainable housing in terms of energy efficiency would make such housing more affordable on an ongoing basis for the people who live in it should be reflected. I was glad that he raised that point. He also focused on some vulnerable groups, and that is useful. Other hon. Members highlighted the situation in the capital. It was useful to hear that there will be further opportunity for that to be discussed later in the week. We must be clear that homelessness is much more than rooflessness; my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) made reference to rough sleeping. While my party welcomes the efforts that the Government have made in dealing with that, it is clear that there are disputes about the official statistics on people who are currently sleeping rough. As he was saying, we must also focus on the fact that many people live in temporary and inadequate accommodation. There are now twice as many families living in temporary accommodation as there were when the Government came to power. Council house waiting lists have risen by 50 per cent., and 100,000 are officially homeless. Shelter's powerful briefing on this issue said that the real figure is more like 500,000. We must address homelessness as the biggest blight on the quality of life of the citizens of this country. It is difficult to address health if people are living in inadequate housing. People cannot take educational opportunities that are presented to them if they have to live in intolerable conditions. Families who are placed in temporary accommodation have the constant worry that they will be moved on somewhere else. That insecurity is found in the private rented sector, where people may be on housing benefit and do not have settled accommodation as they have shorthold tenancies of perhaps six months to a year. They do not have the security that allows them to plan further forward and to feel settled in a community. They feel that they are at risk in future of once again finding themselves homeless and having to return to the local authority for assistance. That means that children are unable to establish themselves in schools or to cement friendships, and that can adversely affect their education and wider social well-being. Current Government guidelines state that councils should avoid using bed-and-breakfast accommodation wherever possible, especially for families with children. However, they state that private landlords can be a source of high-quality, self-contained temporary accommodation. I hope that the Minister will deal with how we can get away from short-term accommodation in tackling this problem. Earlier this year, I tabled a question on Newham's local space initiative, Ealing's safe haven partnership and London and Quadrant housing trust's homeless initiative leasing scheme, all of which are initiatives aimed at bringing temporary accommodation into use as permanent homes and examining new ways of tackling the need for temporary accommodation. I did not get a comprehensive answer, and would welcome further information from the Minister on how many families have been provided with settled homes through those programmes. Single people make up the majority of those living on friends' floors. They are the hidden homeless to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West referred, and they tend to be low down on councils' vulnerability criteria. We need to address, as a country, what these criteria are and come up with a better standard, so that councils have slightly less scope to come up with their own criteria on vulnerability. One would think that creating new social housing stock would be the obvious thing for the Government to do to tackle this problem, but only 170,000 new social homes have been built since 1997. Meanwhile, the social housing stock has been reduced by a net 500,000 homes and local authority waiting lists have also risen by that figure. We must invest more in social housing and we need to build it as quickly as possible. Some local authorities, such as Liberal Democrat-led South Shropshire district council, to which I have referred in previous debates, have used existing possibilities in respect of section 106 agreements to increase the amount of social housing that can be provided as a result of private development. I hope that other local authorities will take the chance to do that. We must also tackle the issue of bringing empty property back into use, which several local authorities have been examining recently. I welcome the Government's initiatives on empty dwelling management orders, which give greater tools to local authorities to address that. The solutions are varied, but we must target resources more in the direction to which other hon. Members referred by providing social, rented accommodation which would offer a permanent, settled solution for people who find themselves homeless and would prevent them from having to return to the lack of security in the private rented sector.",44860,[],Housing,0,17,housing,1150
2006-10-17,Housing,384,Michael Gove,Con,False,"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. I congratulate the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on securing this debate. In her speech she showed a passionate and moving commitment to the plight of homeless people. I know from her contributions in the House that the homelessness crisis has been one of her top political priorities and she has helped to force the issue up the agenda. Her eloquence today reminded us of how effective an advocate she is for the vulnerable and those in need. I entirely endorse the hon. Lady's comments about temporary accommodation. As the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) said, the quality of temporary accommodation in which some homeless people find themselves has improved over the years, but it is still almost always not good enough and not what a civilised society wants. The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) mentioned that, to his surprise, the number of people in temporary accommodation in the east of England is now 171 per cent. of what it had been in 1997. I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman because the situation in the east of England is slightly better than in the country as a whole where the number of people in temporary accommodation has doubled. It is 200 per cent. more than it was in 1997. I know that the Government have made a commitment to halve that but if they do so they will only restore the figure to what it was in 1997. I pay tribute to the Government's commitment, which is part of their overall worthy and admirable commitment to help to reduce poverty, particularly child poverty. However, we must put the statistics into perspective because the hon. Member for Northampton, North, for understandable reasons as a loyal member of her party, thought it was appropriate to cast aspersions on the Conservative record. I am the first to acknowledge that between 1979 and 1997 Conservative Governments made mistakes, but we should bear in mind two matters. The original steps to tackle the acute crisis of homelessness occurred under a Conservative leadership with Michael Howard's championing of the rough sleepers initiative. In addition, during the early 1990s and particularly the 1980s, Conservative Governments were committed to increasing the supply of social housing. As the hon. Lady almost acknowledged, the record for supplying social housing under Conservative Governments was much more successful than the Government's record since 1997.",44860,[],Housing,0,18,housing,408

2006-10-17,Housing,386,Michael Gove,Con,False,"The right to buy certainly ensured that more people had the opportunity of owning their homes, and that policy has now been embraced by both major parties because home ownership is a way of spreading assets more equitably throughout society. As the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) said, one of the flaws in the right-to-buy legislation was that local government and other social landlords could not use capital receipts effectively to reinvest in housing. We propose that future attempts to encourage low-cost home ownership should allow local authorities and housing associations to use the receipts from those sales to fund an overall expansion in the supply of housing. That is an appropriate way both of meeting people's aspirations to own and of ensuring that we have more social housing for those who are genuinely in need. I want to return briefly to what the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter) said. He rightly drew attention to the fact that some housing that is designated affordable, not least in the capital, is affordable only to those who are earning strikingly high salaries. In the strictures that he applied to Conservative local authorities he perhaps forgot that the building of Imperial Wharf in the south of Hammersmith and Fulham occurred with the encouragement of the Deputy Prime Minister and the support of Hammersmith and Fulham council. It is unfair to single out particular local authorities because of their political colour for the part they play in the situation that he so accurately described. That undermined the validity of his important point that when we talk about affordable housing we must ask, â€œAffordable for whom?â€The comments of the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) were useful in helping to clarify the debate. He invited us to consider whether homeless is a consequence of fractured lives or of a broken housing market. He preferred to concentrate on the failures in the housing market. There are failures, but my analysis differs from his. We must not overlook the way in which some of the most acute homelessness problems result from fractured lives. My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) was, unbelievably, attacked by Ministers for a speech that he made earlier this year and which became known as the hug-a-hoodie speech. In that speech my right hon. Friend drew attention to the fact that when dealing with crime we must look at social exclusion, social breakdown and the causes of crime. Unfortunately, I am afraid that in their raucous populism the Government sought to undermine what he was saying. What he said about the causes of crime and the importance of social exclusion applies also to homelessness. Factors applying to homelessness include problems of social fracture: family breakdown and the placing of children in care, which is often not the best solution for those who are in desperate need; the way in which we deal with prisoners and the failure adequately to educate prisoners for a life outside when they complete their sentences; the problems of drug abuse and alcohol addiction; our failure adequately to provide services for those who face those challenges and problems; our failure over generations to deal with the transition of servicemen from service life to civvy street; and, as the hon. Member for Norwich, North eloquently said, particularly the problems of those with mental health challenges. Will the Minister give a commitment today that the supporting people programme will be not only protected but enhanced to ensure independent living for those with mental health challenges and learning difficulties who want and deserve independence, dignity and a home of their own? Housing charities and pressure groups have said that we must address those issues when dealing with homelessness. I pay particular tribute to The Big Issue and its campaign for a Rolls-Royce service for the homeless. It pointed out that the cost of accommodation if people are kept permanently in a state of not having dignity and independence is a long-term drain on the Exchequer. In the long term, early intervention to deal with the problems of social fracture not only helps to rebuild lives but makes sense for the economy. I particularly commend the work of some of our social enterprises, such as the Notting Hill housing trust, which works to ensure that people in accommodation are given skills and the opportunity to save through its schemes, and Thames Reach Bondway, a social enterprise that I had the opportunity of visiting and whose â€œMoving In, Moving Onâ€ programme helps to equip people with the skills required to ensure that when they have a roof over their head they acquire independence. When mentioning social breakdown and the way in which it contributes to the most acute need, we cannot escape the fact that we need more homes in this country. I was delighted when my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney spelled out at the Conservative party conference the vital need to increase housing supply. We have heard today an interesting and often moving analysis of the difficulties of local authorities and others in allocating housing to those in need. Every hon. Member who is familiar with economics recognises that the different ways of solving the problem all come back to the allocation of a scarce resource. Housing in this country-not just social housing but all housing-is scarce, which is why we have house price inflation ahead of the rate of inflation elsewhere in the economy and why local authorities are often forced to make difficult decisions when allocating scarce stock. Some hon. Members mentioned â€œCathy Come Homeâ€. There was a powerful article in The Observer last Sunday by Nick Cohen who pointed out that the problems identified 40 years ago exist today because we are simply not building enough homes to deal with the successor generation of homeless people and successor generation of those who want to get on the property ladder.",44860,[],Housing,0,20,housing,993

2006-10-17,Housing,389,Meg Munn,Lab,False,"As ever in such debates, there are many questions and not much time to answer everything, so I apologise in advance to hon. Members to whom I shall not be able to respond in detail. I want to try to respond specifically to the issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) raised. I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate and on continuing to raise an issue that is clearly of great concern to her in her constituency. The Government have a strong record on tackling homelessness, and I am grateful for the opportunity to set out some of our achievements and aims. The latest quarterly homelessness statistics showed that numbers of new cases of homelessness have fallen to levels not seen since the early 1980s, continuing a trend that started at about the beginning of 2004. The latest statistics show that we are also making good progress in reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation, which is too high. At about 94,000 households, the number is 7 per cent. lower than at the same time last year. We have a target to halve that number by 2010, which we are determined to achieve. Although the level is decreasing, we have done much to minimise the negative impact of homelessness, so that 85 per cent. of households-92 per cent. of households with children-in temporary accommodation are in self-contained homes with their own bathroom and kitchen. On coming into office, the Government were quick to get to grips with the worst manifestations of homelessness. In 1998, the Prime Minister set a target to reduce rough sleeping by two thirds by 2002. It was met one year early and to date it has been sustained, reducing numbers from 1,850 to about 500. In 2002, the Government set a target to end by March 2004 the use for more than six weeks of bed-and-breakfast hotels for families with children. It was ambitious, many said it could not be done, but the target has been met and sustained. We have achieved those successes by continuing to invest in the prevention of homelessness. I shall return to that issue, because it is important. We have invested Â£200 million over the three years to 2007-08. That includes investment in rent deposit schemes to enable households to find good quality accommodation in the private sector, if that is what they want, and investment in mediation services to resolve family and relationship breakdown and enable young people to remain in the family home. In 2002, we also strengthened the homelessness legislation, providing one of the strongest statutory safety nets in the world for homeless households, and requiring all local authorities to draft a strategy to prevent homelessness and provide accommodation and support. Although I am proud of our record of achievement, I am confident that we can do more. I shall turn to the specific issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North raised, because we have been concerned about issues in Northampton. The report of an inspection in 2005 said that housing services providedâ€œa fair, one-star service that had uncertain prospects for improvement.â€The housing inspectorate is carrying out a progress check on the housing service to analyse the progress that has been made since that report. The findings will contribute to the overall progress assessment that the Audit Commission issues in January 2007. On the positive side, there has been an improvement in homelessness figures. Several hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love), raised an important issue about the quality of temporary accommodation. He is right: it is not only about what is provided, but the quality of what is provided. We have issued statutory guidance to local authorities, and as I said, 92 per cent. of families with children are now in self-contained homes. However, we are not content, so we are conducting a survey of 2,500 households in temporary accommodation to understand more about their experiences. We shall issue that report towards the end of this year. My hon. Friends the Members for Northampton, North and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) raised the issue of intentionality. All councils are required to assess applicants in accordance with the legislation, and we monitor that to see whether there is any difference in the statistics on people who are identified as intentionally homeless. The statistics have remained steady, so we are not picking up concerns about that issue.",44860,[],Housing,0,23,housing,745

2006-10-17,Housing,391,Meg Munn,Lab,False,"That is a concern, and I shall take it back to my Department. We need to address it with the Department for Education and Skills, and I shall to write to my hon. Friend. The Government set up their homelessness system to prevent homelessness. I am sure every hon. Member agrees that it is better to prevent homelessness than to have to deal with it. Homelessness legislation was always intended to be a safety net, and not the main route to social housing. Good practice says that people should be given a choice, and that may include the private sector. Many people live quite reasonably in the private sector, and it is an option. It is also important that if families are at risk of homelessness, whether in the private sector or anywhere else, they talk to their councils early on, because measures exist to enable housing authority assistance. On the issue of the gap between the market rent and housing benefit, discretionary housing payments can be used temporarily to allow more suitable and affordable accommodation to be found. Single room rent is a matter for the Department for Work and Pensions, but we continue to work together. The hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George), whose constituency I recently visited, raised the issue of the whole system. My Department, with the Government offices for the regions, supports local authorities so that they can improve their strategic housing role. They must consider not only the social market, but the whole market and how it works. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North raised the issue of hostels. They are funded through the supporting people programme, as he identified, which requires staff to assess support needs and construct support plans that supporting people commissioning groups then monitor. We are not complacent about hidden homelessness. We are considering other ways of identifying it, such as measuring overcrowding in concealed and shared housing. I do not have much time, but the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) should not give me lessons on the problems of homelessness. I worked in social services for 16 years under a Conservative Government. The hon. Gentleman rightly identified the problematic issues and their causes, but for anybody who had to turn away 16 and 17-year-olds without accommodation or funding, or who at half-past 10 at night had to phone a housing officer to look for accommodation for a mother with three young children, there were no answers under the previous Conservative Government. Too many households live in temporary accommodation, but we have a strategy in place which I believe will succeed in meeting our target to halve the number by 2010. We are committed to delivering a wide range of preventive services, increasing homelessness grants to local authorities and voluntary sector agencies by 23 per cent. by 2007-08, helping 1.2 million vulnerable people sustain independent living through the Â£5 billion supporting people programme over three years to 2007-08, providing 75,000 new social rented homes between 2005-06 and 2007-08, and building an extra 10,000 social homes a year by 2008. We will also invest Â£90 million to improve hostels and their services, and help rough sleepers make a permanent move away from the streets. In conclusion, I thank all Members who have participated. This is an important area. The Government are not complacent, and we are doing more, including ensuring that a greater number of homes and affordable homes are built throughout our country.",44860,[],Housing,0,25,housing,578

I have run through every group that takes responsibility for the health of the housing market and they are all opposed to these regulations. However, what of the secondary test? Will these regulations speed up transactions and make them less stressful? Will they end gazumping, as we were once told that they would? Every expert opinion, as we have heard, says no. Why? That is because under these regulations, before anyone can even market their property, they will need to assemble a bundle of documents, which it will be no easy business to get in place in time. Let us take the requirement to have local authority searches. We know that there is a wild variation in the cost and speed with which those documents are provided. We also know from the limited dry runs of HIPs which the Government have so far allowed that local authorities are simply not equipped to provide the searches required in the time required to allow properties to be marketed. One of the largest companies in the business of providing search material is MDA Search Flow. As it has explained:â€œIn the Dry Run areas the search market moved from 40 per cent. of the searches being personal to 100 per cent. of the searches being personal. This has caused significant delays as local authorities have struggled and ultimately failed to copeâ€. The managing director goes on to warn:â€œThere is no way that all of the 2 million odd personal searches required can be facilitated by the local authorities... The Government's proposals to solve this problem are wholly inept. The market will be chaotic.â€That is from a company that supports HIPs, yet it believes that the Government's execution has been comprehensively botched. If sellers cannot get the searches done in time, properties cannot be marketed, so sellers will be frustrated and buyers will see the supply of housing even further constrained.

As the Law Society has explained, many buyers will be advised not to accept the personal searches supplied by sellers. The law of caveat emptor applies in house purchases. In many cases, buyers will look at the document supplied and their solicitor will tell them that they cannot be certain that it is not shoddy or partial or inadequate. They might advise them to commission their own searches, so there will potentially be twice the number of searches commissioned, additional costs throughout the process and additional complications.

There was support for more housing and for more regulation, but nothing on the environment before December 2005. I am sure that hon. Members will remember what happened at that time. My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) became leader of the Conservative party and put the environment at the heart of our campaigning. After December 2005, what was there on the Minister's website? There was silence until May 2006, just two weeks after my right hon. Friend had secured 40 per cent. of the vote in the local elections. The Minister then suddenly emerged from her purdah, her self-imposed silence, to make her first speech as a Minister for five months. To whom? To the Green Alliance. When we campaigned with the message â€œVote blue, go greenâ€, we had no idea that the Minister would take that message to heart. Now, as a new convert to Cameron conservatism, she is talking about building eco-homes. Let me remind her that, as the Economic Secretary to the Treasury pointed out in Committee yesterday, no zero carbon homes have been built so far, and the number qualifying for zero stamp duty on the basis of zero carbon in the years ahead will be-as he said in answer to a parliamentary question-â€œnegligibleâ€. Ten years in office, and no progress on the environment. Yet as soon as my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney was elected leader of the Conservative party, Ministers were galvanised into greenery. Just imagine what we could do for the environment if we were actually in power- We would certainly take the provision of energy performance certificates seriously, unlike this Government and their Back Benchers, who seem to regard the environment as a subject for hilarity. I am glad that they are laughing at their own record. There will be plenty of opportunity for them to weep when the voters pass their verdict on it at the general election in a couple of years' time. If the Government were serious about energy efficiency they would have put the people in place to carry out the energy inspections that are at the heart of the provisions on energy performance certificates, but once again, the Minister and her Department have failed to listen and learn. A year ago, we said that there were not enough people in place, but the Government said that they would get the 7,500 inspectors that they needed; it would be all right on the night. A month ago, however, they revised that figure down and said that they would need only 2,500. Why the sudden reduction? We asked two weeks ago how many inspectors were fully trained and accredited, and we were given the answer at 5 o'clock on the Friday of the May bank holiday weekend: not one domestic energy assessor had passed the test and been accredited. With less than four weeks to go before the implementation of what the Minister describes as a key policy to combat climate change, not one of the 2,500-or 7,500; which is it?-qualified, accredited inspectors is ready to respond. How does the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) explain that?",46577,[],Housing,0,35,housing,711

Let me remind him that the first significant international agreement on combating climate change was signed by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) when he was Environment Secretary. The first world statesman to sound a warning on global climate change was Baroness Thatcher, at the Government Dispatch Box in 1988. We will take no lessons from the Johnny-come-latelies from Staffordshire. There are many fine Members of Parliament in Staffordshire. Some of them, however, need not only a history lesson but an ecology tutorial before they open their mouths again on this subject. The Government are now trying to rush through a few more domestic energy assessors who have passed their test and been accredited. Yesterday, however, I was talking to representatives of the largest HIP provider in Britain, Spicer Haart. It is in despair; it has given up on the Government. It said thatâ€œwe have only managed to identify sufficient assessors to cover 40 per cent. of our requirementsâ€. And let us remember that those are people who have not even been accredited; they have only passed their exam. Spicer Haart went on to say thatâ€œgiven that we have significant managerial and capital resources at our disposal, you can begin to appreciate the scale of the difficulty the industry as a whole hasâ€. With less than four weeks before HIPs went live, there was not a single person qualified and accredited to give out an EPC. How can that be taking climate change seriously? With less than two weeks to go, the biggest provider of home information packs cannot identify enough people to carry out even half its requirements. How can that be taking climate change seriously? If the Government are serious about climate change, why are they not introducing EPCs into the rental and commercial sectors on 1 June? It is because they simply have not laid the necessary foundations, and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich knows it. This is the Government who say that they favour energy efficient homes, but only last week they were cutting grants to their low carbon building programme, slashing spending on solar energy by 80 per cent. and hacking back support for wind and other renewables by 50 per cent.",46577,[],Housing,0,37,housing,388

Let me offer to save them further embarrassment. If they will ditch home information packs-that is the motion under debate today-we will help them to ensure that energy performance certificates work. After all, Ministers discovered greenery only after the Conservatives showed them the way.

The main document in the home information pack-the only new document that is being added to the process-is the energy performance certificate. The certificates will give people's homes an energy rating for the first time. That is like a fridge rating for the home that they are hoping to buy. We get such information on our washing machines, our fridges and our dishwashers, and it is high time that we got it on our homes. The threat of climate change is real and urgent, and 27 per cent. of our carbon emissions comes from our homes. How can people be expected to make the necessary improvements if they do not have proper information about what is needed to make a difference? How many of us have any idea about the lagging in the loft, when we are looking for a home to buy? How many of us have any idea whether a home has cavity walls, or even know what a cavity wall is? This year, people will get that kind of information in energy performance certificates for the first time. That will make it possible for people to think about proper energy efficiency improvements to their homes. As for the impact of fridge ratings, if we look at all the white goods in Comet and Currys, we see that the overwhelming majority now have â€œAâ€ ratings. The provision of that information has had an impact on the market and on the way in which people behave.

2007-05-16,Housing,179,Yvette Cooper,Lab,False,"The hon. Gentleman is right: there is a big difference between a fridge and a house. Homes are responsible for 27 per cent. of our carbon emissions. They are the biggest investment that most of us will make in our lives; their running costs are considerably higher than those of fridges; and if the information is provided for a fridge, it ought to be provided for a home. The issue is a basic one of giving proper information that will help consumers to take decisions to improve the energy efficiency of their homes, and help them cut carbon emissions and their fuel bills. According to the Energy Saving Trust, homeowners could save up to Â£300 on their fuel bills every year if they act on basic recommendations about their homes. Many will also be able to get grants of Â£100 to Â£300 from their new energy supplier, linked to the measures in the energy performance certificate. Some will be able to get much larger grants through other programmes. Companies are now developing green loans and mortgages to be linked to EPCs. The measures in the EPCs could help to cut carbon emissions by nearly 1 million tonnes a year. That is why WWF, Friends of the Earth, the Campaign to Protect Rural England and a series of different organisations are supporting those measures. The remaining elements of HIPs are the legal and search documents that one already needs when buying and selling a home, but they will be gathered at the beginning rather than the end of the process, to speed things up and improve competition. For many of us, buying and selling a home is a baffling process. There can be huge delays between offer and exchange. In complex chains, that can mean that sales fall through. Most people will struggle to keep track of what services they are getting and paying for. HIPs will make the process much clearer and faster. In many other industries, competition, new technology and rising customer expectations have lowered prices, increased transparency and speeded up transactions. Importantly, however, that has not happened to the process of buying and selling a home. In fact, the move from offer to exchange takes longer even than 10 years ago, and in many areas where house prices have doubled, for example, so have estate agents' fees.",46577,[],Housing,0,46,housing,389

It would not be surprising if that had an impact on the timing of listings in both May and June, and it may take time for people to get used to the new system. However, listings fluctuate substantially from month to month. A million houses are sold every year, at an average cost of Â£200,000.

She objects to them because she does not like the fact that someone will have to carry out energy ratings of people's homes. She saidâ€œthe new feature is having energy performance assessors come round and actually look at how your house is put together... so it's a very intrusive measure.â€Perhaps the hon. Lady will explain how she can support energy ratings of homes if she opposes the idea of people going round to those homes to carry them out. How does she think that energy ratings on homes will be done? That provides more evidence of Conservative Members opposing energy performance certificates. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath takes a different line. His objection is that we are gold-plating EU regulations. That is true; we are going beyond the minimum requirements for energy performance certificates set out in the EU directive. However, that is not gold-plating; it is green-plating, and we make no apology for that. The European minimum that the hon. Gentleman advocates is that people should be able to use an energy performance certificate if it is up to 10 years old. Well, it is a fat lot of use to a new home buyer to have information on a home's fuel costs and running costs that could be up to eight or nine years old. There will not be a huge impact in respect of how people respond to energy performance certificates if they know that the energy information in them is out of date. The fact is that Opposition Members are trying to block energy performance certificates; they are trying to delay them and to water down the information.

The truth is that he does not like energy performance certificates at all. The Conservative party's leader claims to care about the environment, but time and again it will not back the practical measures needed to help to cut carbon emissions. The right hon. Member for Witney took a trip to the Arctic, organised by WWF, to demonstrate his commitment to the environment. It was his photo-opportunity to hug a husky. While he was there, he was asked for his top tips for people to go greener. He mentioned bicycling to work and growing vegetables, and he said that some of the steps that we can take to reduce our impact on the environment, such as home insulation, will save us money. He also stated that leadership means doing the right thing not just saying it. Well, the Conservatives should do the right thing now. They should back these measures to bring in environmental improvements. However, they will not back them. What do WWF and Friends of the Earth now say about the Conservatives' environmental policy? Let me quote from a letter from them to the Conservatives:â€œYour party is currently campaigning for the local elections, under the slogan â€˜Vote blue, go green'â€-That sounds familiar. The letter continues:â€œHowever, we are concerned that by attempting to block the HIPs, you risk scuppering one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation to affect households in recent years. We therefore urgently request that you...reassure us that under no circumstances will you allow their introduction...to become a victim of moves by your party to delay the rest of the HIP.â€The huskies have just cocked their legs on the Conservatives' environment policy. If their environment policy were energy rated now it would get a big â€œGâ€. Perhaps that is not the only big â€œGâ€ that they will have to reckon with in the next few months.

Those inside the Labour big tent who are still supporters of the scheme in its full-blooded, 1997 manifesto style could at least get some reassurance from the way that things were evolving by thinking that they would have the slimmed down scheme before them with the results of the evaluation of the pilot studies also available and that in this debate they would be able to rebut the challenges and accusations from the Opposition Benches by referring to the detailed results of those studies which would show that all the bad predictions were not justified. However, the pilot studies have not been completed; there has been no proper evaluation and there is no hard evidence of success. The safeguard of those trials producing evidence on which we could take a proper and balanced decision-which was much talked about last year when the scheme was debated on several occasions in this House-is not available. The safeguard has been swept away. I want to bring to the attention of the House some of the evidence that Mr. McDonald gave to the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee of the other place. Mr. McDonald appeared on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government, and he said that it cannot yet check the pilot studies to find out what savings have been made in transaction times. He said that that was because it would need at least 3,500 transactions to have been completed before it could make that assessment. I was surprised when I read that evidence; I was not surprised by the idea that 3,500 examples would be needed to reach a judgment, but I was astonished that 3,500 transactions had not been conducted so far. The Minister did not deal with the issue of the pilot studies. There was a good reason for that; to have done so would have underlined the embarrassing situation that she is in and the difficulties that the scheme faces. The pilot studies were supposed to have started in July last year. They could not start because the regulations were not produced in time. They were supposed to restart-have their second start-in October last year. Yet the evidence that Mr. McDonald gave to the Committee was that most of the schemes had not started until January this year and that it was therefore too early to evaluate whether they were performing in accordance with the Minister's predictions.",46577,[],Housing,0,66,housing,535

That related to whether there should be a voluntary or a compulsory element to the home condition reports. On that, the Department-Mr. McDonald-was caught betwixt and between. In one part of his evidence he said that the reason why the Department had changed to a voluntary system for the home condition reports was that it thought that it was right for that to be taken forward by the market, rather than be imposed by regulation. However, he also said that the Department estimated that a negligibly small amount of home condition reports would actually be taken up. On the one hand the Department wanted to rely on the voluntary principle to deliver home condition reports because it thought that the market would suck them in, and on the other hand it accepted that none-or almost none-would be done. In support of his point of view that the voluntary scheme would not work, Mr. McDonald added that the Law Society had had its own voluntary scheme which it had tried to market in previous years and that it had failed and had to be withdrawn.",46577,[],Housing,0,68,housing,205

In the emollient part of her speech, the Minister said that the pilot studies have in fact influenced the final document-that changes have been made. If Members take a careful look at the Government's explanatory memorandum, they will see that it details some of the changes that have been made as a consequence of taking account of the first half of the pilot studies. The Government found evidence of changes that need to be made, but they seem to have closed their mind to the possibility that the second half of the pilot studies might equally produce such evidence.

However, where is the risk assessment of this project? I begin to wonder whether the Department has a new acronym: the WAAP assessment, which stands for â€œwith a wing and a prayerâ€. Before we introduce this scheme, we need some evaluation of the risks of pressing ahead. It will not do to say that the scheme is coming in regardless before the pilots have finished, given that the people who will pay the price, literally, are the 1 million-perhaps nearer 2 million-householders who will be buying and selling. Who will carry the risk of this scheme going wrong? It might be a very low risk, and perhaps the Minister will be able to return to the House in a year's time triumphant, but there is a risk.

2007-05-16,Housing,214,Andrew Stunell,LibDem,False,"The Government ought really by now to have learned from what happened last July, when the late issuing of their regulations led to the frustration of the timing of the pilot studies. Like the Irishman, I would not have started from here. It all started to go wrong way back when those regulations were not made available. The moment may have come to answer the earlier intervention from the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas), who asked about energy performance certificates. If home information packs are, in the words of the Scottish returning officer, to be â€œdeclared void for want of certaintyâ€, it is important not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Energy performance certificates are an extremely useful starting point for raising the awareness of sellers and buyers alike of the energy efficiency of their homes and what they can do about it. By way of practical example and to support the Minister in what she said-in the emollient bit of her speech-I point out that there are 5 million homes in this country with cavity walls but no cavity wall insulation. Most of the owners of those homes are probably in the situation that I was in until last November, when I unveiled, as MPs do, a warm homes project and met at the unveiling a cavity wall installer. Like me, those homeowners probably assumed that the house that they bought had cavity wall insulation, while not knowing for sure. I asked the cavity wall installer, â€œIs there a simple way of finding out whether my walls have cavity wall insulation?â€ He said, â€œYes, it takes five minutes. Do you want me to pop round?â€ He came round, drilled a little hole, looked, let me have a look and said, â€œNo, you haven't.â€ I have got it now. It cost Â£250 and it was money well spent. Another 5 million households do not have cavity wall insulation and the EPCs will make that explicit to the owners or the next owners of those properties.

That self-evidently absurd way of proceeding could not be justified in any other field of commerce. The hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) asked why we did not propose EPCs at the point of sale. If he thought about it, he would realise what an absurd proposition that was. It would be absurd to be given an assessment of a fridge's performance only at the point at which one had agreed to buy it, instead of when considering competing models and deciding which is the most energy efficient.

When valuations are commissioned by mortgage lenders, they make money on the process each time. In many cases, they make rather a lot of money. If the valuation has to be done repeatedly on the same property, they are not out of pocket. No wonder they like the existing system. Every time a surveyor is commissioned to conduct a valuation or survey, their fees are paid, so they are not in a hurry to promote changes to the system, which involves waste to the consumer and the public.

2007-05-16,Housing,231,Tony Baldry,Con,False,"On occasions, this debate has been fairly rumbustious, largely due to the excellence of the opening speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove). However, in the few minutes remaining, I hope that I can take a slightly different approach to the matter. I think that all hon. Members agree that the energy performance certificates are good news. There does not seem to be any dispute about that, so can we take it as a given that everyone wants them, and wants the scheme, when it is implemented, to be a success? Like the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), I was a housing Minister. After four years in that job, I can sense when a project is not going to get off the ground. For a number of weeks, I have tabled questions to the Minister for Housing and Planning, asking for details of how many domestic energy assessors and home inspectors there are in each local authority, city and region. Week after week, the response that I got was that the question would be answered â€œshortlyâ€. Eventually, I raised the matter with the Leader of the House at last week's business questions, and at last got something of an answer. However, I was still not given a number. The answer that I received did not disaggregate home inspectors and domestic energy assessors. Instead, it lumped both together, and it gave no breakdown of how many there were per district. The answer did not even disaggregate those who had qualified and those who were still in training. At the end of last week, the best that the Department could do was to say that the total number of inspectors and assessors-both fully trained and still in training-was something approaching 2,000. The answer went on to say that there was no point in giving a breakdown in terms of local authority, city or region because domestic energy assessors will work on a regional basis. The fact that the assessors will have to drive all over a region, thus increasing carbon emissions, is apparently neither here nor there. Not unreasonably, therefore, at the end of last week I tabled a named day question, asking whether the Secretary of State, pursuant to her answer of 8 May, could tell me how many practising domestic energy assessors and home inspectors there are in each region. After all, we are only 15 days away from the implementation of the scheme, so one would have thought that the Department would at least know how many inspectors and assessors there are in each region. What answer did I get to my named day question? I was told that the Secretary of State would answer it â€œshortlyâ€. Only two reasonable inference can be drawn from the fact that Ministers cannot tell the House how many domestic energy assessors there are in each region. In fact, an extrapolation from the answer that I got last week shows that there may be only 57 qualified inspectors in the north-east, 76 in Wales and 152 in London. That is pretty pathetic, so either Ministers do know the numbers involved and are too embarrassed to tell the House, or they have no idea. In either case, I suggest that it would be in everyone's interest to postpone the scheme for three months, until October. I have no idea about the merits of the judicial review being sought by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, but I would be amazed if the single judge who has to make the decision does not give leave for that review to be heard. Moreover, it is fanciful to believe that the High Court could hold a full hearing before 1 June, so that is another layer of uncertainty. Ministers must be able, with confidence, to tell the House, the country and everyone involved that there are enough inspectors and domestic energy assessors in every region. They will be doing themselves-and people who believe in energy conservation and going green-no favours if they sleepwalk into a disaster with this scheme. All they have to do is postpone it for three months until they-and the country-are confident that there are enough inspectors and assessors. If they do not do that, there is every prospect that the scheme will be a disaster.",46577,[],Housing,0,98,housing,721
2007-05-16,Housing,232,Nia Griffith,Lab,False,"It makes tremendous sense for the provision of information to be the responsibility of the seller. We all know of cases where houses remain on the market for ages while prospective buyer after prospective buyer pays for the same information, discovering features that make the property undesirable or unrealistically priced. The onus on the seller to provide a home information pack and an energy performance certificate will help to avoid much duplication. Many people are both vendors and purchasers, so although they will have to provide information about the home that they sell, they will benefit from the information about the houses that they view. The earlier in the process such information is available, the less likely people are to want, or to be forced, to pull out of the purchase, which can often result in a chain reaction of lost sales, expensive bridging loans and immense stress. First-time buyers will particularly benefit from the fact that the seller must provide useful and valuable information that could save them from going a long way down the line only to discover a major problem. For many of us in this place, who have experience of living in various homes and paying numerous bills, the features we need to look at to assess energy efficiency may be obvious. First-time buyers are the least likely to have such experience, yet they are often among the most committed to tackling climate change and have the most need to budget carefully for future fuel bills. We hear plenty of warm words about tackling climate change and reducing emissions, but it is no good talking about it if we are not prepared to introduce measures and incentives that actually encourage home owners to focus on energy efficiency. If people know that they will need to obtain an energy performance certificate when they sell their home it will encourage them to prioritise measures that make their home more energy efficient. They will benefit from lower energy bills, while the do-it-yourself market will respond by providing better information about the energy efficiency of materials and products. There has been a tendency for opponents of the scheme to say that the pack may not tell the whole story; and of course, caveat emptor-let the buyer beware. None the less, the pack is a valid tool. We could compare the process to buying a second-hand car with a recent MOT certificate.

His elevation was overdue and well deserved, and I am delighted that he will be responding. I am grateful to the other Members present for coming, and for deciding to participate in a debate on a subject that is rising rapidly towards the top of the political agenda. That was shown at an early stage by the new Prime Minister's announcement that the Minister for Housing would attend Cabinet, which demonstrates that this is now one of the biggest political issues in the country. There is no doubt that there is a big problem with housing provision in this country. The subject of this debate is fairly wide-ranging, and I intend to touch on a number of issues, to which I hope the Minister can respond. First, we should set out some of the problems that we face. A typical first-time buyer is now unable to afford a mortgage in 93 per cent. of towns in the UK. Given recent interest rate rises and future ones to come, it appears that that situation will only get worse. We should be very concerned about that.",47197,[],Housing,0,2,housing,210

A number of factors come into play, and my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) rightly pointed out that immigration is one. We should not ignore it. The problem is that the Government have made some 17 statements-either oral or written-on housing, and yet not one has mentioned the effect that immigration is having on housing provision in this country. It is such an important factor that it surely cannot be right that of those 17 different statements, not one has touched on the impact of immigration. Houses are becoming unaffordable for first-time buyers. Last year, we had the lowest annual total of first-time buyers since 1980-just 315,000. To strike a contrast, back in 1997 there were 503,000 first-time buyers. That shows the scale of the problem that we face. Fewer people are getting on to the housing ladder, and last year saw one of the first falls in the number of owner-occupied houses in this country. The Government should be ashamed of that and anxious to do something about it. On affordability, the National Housing Federation states that in my local authority area-I would have thought that Bradford was one of the most affordable places in the country, not one of the least-the average house price is about Â£123,000. The average annual income needed for a mortgage to cover that figure is more than Â£33,000; however, the average income in Bradford is just over Â£19,000. Couples might just about be able to afford to buy a house, but in many cases they might not. Single people who want to get on the housing ladder when they leave university or school or enter work for the first time have little chance of getting into the housing market, even in Bradford. I am sure that that problem must be even worse in other parts of the country. We have a big problem. The Government have decided that the answer is to build 3 million new homes over the next 20 years. My concern is that the focus seems to be entirely on supply. We are just accepting what is happening-and so we need to build 3 million new homes. There must be some mileage in considering the demand side of the equation, as well as the supply side. We are a small island-we cannot get away from our geographical nature-and surely we cannot just keep building more new houses in to the future. Surely someone will say, â€œThat's it. We're not prepared to give up any more green fields, green belt, gardens or land.â€ I am not entirely sure when that point will come, or when the Government think that it will come. Surely it is not sustainable to build 3 million houses every 20 years. At some point, that will have to come to an end.",47197,[],Housing,0,8,housing,492

In passing, I pay tribute to Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch UK, who has used Government figures-not his own-to highlight the problem that we face. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), who secured an informative and good debate yesterday on immigration and touched on the issue of housing, and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), who has done a great deal of work in this field. He has published a pamphlet called, â€œToo Much of a Good Thing? - Towards a balanced approach to immigrationâ€. I think that it is available in all good bookshops, and I urge Members to have a look at it and to read yesterday's debate, in which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex made some pertinent points. According to the Government's own figures, 31 per cent. of the new houses built are needed to deal with immigration. That means that of the 3 million houses that the Government have said need to be built, by their own admission 1 million are needed to deal with future migration into this country. They are needed to deal not with the current level of immigration, but with the Government's projection of future migration, accepting their estimate that there will be a 30 per cent. drop in immigration, and factoring in their figures. That is how much immigration affects the amount of housing required. It is no good our trying to pretend that those figures are not there-they are the Government's own and we cannot sweep them under the carpet. The number of asylum seekers granted permission to stay in the UK has exceeded the number of new social houses built by nearly 40,000 in the 10 years since 1997. The number of grants of asylum and extended leave to remain has totalled more than 228,000, compared with the 188,000 additional social and local authority homes built in the period. That is clearly unsustainable. The Government cannot allow it to continue, and then wonder why there is such a shortage of housing at local authority level and for first-time buyers. Currently, one migrant a minute is coming into this country-the equivalent in population terms of a city the size of Birmingham every three years or so. That level of immigration is completely unsustainable, and unless the Government get to grips with the issue and we have a controlled and sustainable level of immigration, we will not solve the housing crisis that we face.",47197,[],Housing,0,13,housing,432

2007-07-18,Housing,411,Philip Davies,Con,False,"I shall make some progress. I know that others wish to speak, and we could get bogged down for a very long time on this one issue. I hope that the Government will indicate what effect they feel immigration has had on the amount of new housing required and what they intend to do about it. Do they accept that we need a limit on immigration to this country, and does the Minister accept the figure that I gave-that one third of new housing is needed to deal with immigration? To pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), according to Government figures a lot of the growth in housing need is due to the increase in one-person households. Part of the problem is demographic-nobody would dispute that-but it is also partly caused by family breakdown. A charity based in my constituency called Nightstop UK does a fantastic job in dealing with homeless people between the ages of 16 and 24. I highlight it because it does a superb job across the country in helping young homeless people to find homes. When homeless people come to Nightstop UK, it does a survey and asks them what the factors relating to their homelessness are. Between 2001 and 2006, 44 per cent.-the single biggest figure-of young people who went to it said that family breakdown was the biggest reason for their homelessness; only 3 per cent. said that it was a lack of accommodation. Family breakdown in one form or another was driving their homelessness. I therefore encourage Members to examine carefully the recommendations made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) and his social justice policy review group. He made some brave and intelligent observations about what can be done to tackle family breakdown, which causes a great deal of misery to a lot of young people, not just in Shipley but across the country. We need to consider what we can do to tackle that problem. Despite what I have said, I accept that we need more housing. If the Government were to tackle some of the issues driving the demand for housing, we would not need as much housing as they claim, but I accept that more houses need to be built. One issue to consider is where we are going to build them. I would not like them to be built on green belt land. The amount of housing built on such land has been one of my concerns in the past few years. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) promoted a private Member's Bill last year that would have introduced a rule whereby, once land had been allocated as green belt, it would be green belt for ever. If it is green belt land today, it should surely be green belt land tomorrow; that should not change. The Government will say, â€œThere is as much green belt land now as there was in 1997.â€ Indeed, but the issue is that it is not the same green belt land and it is not of the same quality. The Government build houses on some of the most beautiful parts of the country and replace those areas with land that most people would not consider green belt, and which is not of the same quality. To me, that is an erosion of the green belt, whether or not it is so in numbers terms. Between 1997 and 2004, the Government allowed 162 planning applications for developments on green belt land, although they had the power to stop them. The aviation White Paper proposes aviation expansion resulting in the loss of 700 hectares of green belt land, and about 10,000 acres of green belt are at risk from proposals in draft Government regional plans, including land in Luton, Harlow, Bath, Bristol, Birmingham, Coventry, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Bournemouth, Poole and Nottingham. I urge the Minister to consider seriously the impact of allowing developments on green belt land, and then trying to cover that up by replacing it with land that is not of the same nature or quality, and pretending that there has been no erosion of the green belt under this Government. It is clear that there has been. That is a particular problem in my region of Yorkshire and Humber, where 17 per cent. of the land within 1997 designated green belt areas has changed to residential use. That strikes me as an incredibly high figure-the national average in England is 12 per cent. Five per cent. of new dwellings built between 1992 and 2001 were built in 1997 designated green belt areas. I find that unacceptable, and I seriously hope that the Minister will reconsider the protection that we give to green belt land, and not just replace it with other land. I also hope that the Government will reflect on building on floodplains. We have seen the devastating consequences, particularly in parts of Yorkshire, of building houses on floodplains. This is also a big issue in the Yorkshire and Humber region. The amount of land changing to residential use and the percentage of new dwellings being built in 2002 flood-risk areas is 16 per cent. It is no good allowing and encouraging houses to be built on floodplains and then saying how sorry we are when many of them get flooded, particularly if the response is as inadequate as it has been in many areas, but that is a topic for a different occasion. I hope that if one positive thing comes out of the tragedy experienced in many parts of the country, but particularly in parts of Yorkshire, in the past few weeks, it will be that the Government think again about the sense of building lots of houses on floodplains.

Local authorities have to factor in all those things when deciding on planning applications. It is no good trying to pretend that local authorities have a free reign in dealing with planning applications, because, as we all know, they do not. They often operate under the threat of a developer taking his case to a planning inspector on appeal, and the planning inspector then overruling the local authority's decision, at immense cost to the local authority and the council tax payer. We cannot ignore that factor in their deliberations.

2007-07-18,Housing,421,Philip Davies,Con,False,"The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, but I would like the Government to give local authorities more freedom in determining planning applications. At the end of the day, they are democratically accountable and best placed to know what is in the best interests of the local area. It is unfortunate that a planning inspector from Bristol will often visit a given area and overrule a democratically accountable and elected local authority that has made a decision that may be popular in the local community. I certainly welcomed the announcement about abolishing regional assemblies-something that the Conservative party has called for for many years. My concern is that we have not actually moved away at all from the idea that a regional body of unelected, unaccountable and unwanted people should make decisions about the number of houses to be built in a particular area. The Minister accepted yesterday that the spatial planning strategies will still be going ahead as planned, and that the number of houses that the regional body, at the behest of Government policy, will expect my local authority to build will therefore be unchanged. My local authority must find places for those houses, regardless of whether local people want them or whether there are suitable places for them. The local authority is under pressure to find places, so that housing targets can be met. The Sustainable Communities Bill went through the House of Commons not too long ago with all-party support. Its purpose was to try to ensure that local communities have more say in what happens in their local area. If the Government truly support the Bill, I hope that they will give more power and freedom to local authorities to determine housing applications, without the spectre of planning inspectors and regional targets hanging over them. I have one final point. I am aware that I have taken up a lot of time, Mr. Cummings, but I have tried to be generous with interventions. One of the things that really irritates my constituents, particularly in Baildon-the village in which I live-is that housing applications are approved and more and more buildings go up, yet there is no infrastructure to support them. In the surveys that I carry out, this is a big issue for local residents. All that happens is that traffic problems and the quality of life get worse.

I was on the Committee that considered that Bill, and the thrust of it is that all the appropriate community infrastructure, such as schools, community centres, doctors and so on, must be in place when substantial development takes place.

I, too, would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my hon. Friend on his appointment and to welcome the innovation that the Minister for Housing now attends Cabinet. I am particularly pleased about the strong emphasis on building new housing, particularly new social housing, in the draft legislative programme. Given the legacy of neglect that we inherited, the Government have a good record on investing in the refurbishment of social housing. Progress towards the decent homes standard is important, but not nearly enough has been done to increase supply, both of social housing and affordable housing to buy. That means that in my constituency and many others, thousands of people endure the misery of inadequate and over-crowded housing conditions, which has an appalling effect on their quality of life and on their life chances. As the drive for more housing gathers pace and with the Green Paper in mind, I am particularly concerned that nothing in that Green Paper or in the language used to describe our housing approach closes off the option of development on appropriate green belt land near Oxford. In the circumstances confronting our area, we must have an urban extension to Oxford if we are to meet housing need, and there is nowhere else for that to go but on present green belt land because green belt boundaries are drawn so close to the built-up area of the city. Housing provision is a key local concern to those in housing need and to the many people who have grown up in the city and who cannot now afford to live there. The impact of housing provision on the labour market, public services and business activity is raised with me all the time, whether I am meeting the chamber of commerce, the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses, universities, hospitals, or the trade unions. Just about everybody with an interest in housing provision and the economic vitality of Oxford, which is at the cutting edge of regional and national growth and could contribute still more given room to grow, accepts that we have to modify the green belt. I and local councillors have campaigned hard on this issue. Readiness to go ahead with an urban extension is synonymous locally with being serious about tackling the housing crisis. There is an overwhelmingly strong case for building more housing in the south-east, particularly in central Oxfordshire. The city's housing needs survey, which was conducted by Fordhams, identified a need for 1,700 to 1,800 new affordable properties a year. I would like to press the case for agreeing with the â€œBarker Review of Land Use Planningâ€, which states that the green belt policyâ€œhas...in some parts of Southern England... had some unsatisfactory consequencesâ€. Barker's interim report notes that there are now some 27,000 more jobs than residents in Oxford, which has led to large numbers of commuters â€œjumpingâ€-to use the phrase that she used-the green belt every day. Of course, in practice, people are not so much jumping the green belt as crawling through it in the polluting traffic jams that creep in and out of the city each day. Recommendation 9 of the Barker review states:â€œRegional planning bodies and local planning authorities should review green belt boundaries as part of their regional spatial strategy/local development framework processes to ensure that they remain relevant and appropriate, given the need to ensure that any planned development takes place in the most sustainable locationâ€.",47197,[],Housing,0,34,housing,643
2007-07-18,Housing,427,Andrew Smith,Lab,False,"To meet the enormous backlog of social housing need in Oxford there is a strong case for one or more urban extensions of the city into the green belt, with a compensating extension of the green belt elsewhere. The city has unique economic needs, which can best be met within or adjacent to it. The substantial scale of housing needs within the central Oxfordshire sub-region cannot be accommodated in the county's towns alone. There is an opportunity to build truly sustainable communities, associated with the city; also, new infrastructure is more sustainable and the associated costs are lower in proximity to the city. Oxford city already has a very good brownfield development record. It is consistently the local authority with the highest rate in the country of reuse of existing sites for development. Yet that development has manifestly failed to meet the city's substantial need for new homes. Moreover, the scope for additional housing in the built-up area is rapidly becoming exhausted, with unacceptable pressures on existing residential areas and green spaces in the city, including gardens, which the hon. Gentleman talked about. I very much hope that with the Green Paper and the south-east plan examination under way, the chance will now be taken to review the central Oxfordshire green belt, in the light of the overwhelming evidence, as well as the recommendations of the Barker review. Before I draw my remarks to a close, let me knock on the head the nonsense that is heard from opponents of house building that those of us who believe in tackling market failure and responding to people's real housing needs somehow want to concrete over south-east England. Nothing could be further from the truth. As the Barker review analysis showed, outside London just 12.2 per cent. of land is currently developed. We can both build the extra houses that are needed and preserve the distinctive beauty of the English countryside. We can also respect the greatest aesthetic and ecological characteristic of cities such as Oxford by protecting the green wedges-the corridors of countryside that come right into the city centre, which, if we do not review the green belt, will come under inexorable pressure. Some hon. Members may have seen a comment piece by Tristram Hunt in The Observer last Sunday, which claimed that Ministersâ€œadvocated ripping up Britain's green belt to solve the housing crisis.â€Ministers have said no such thing. They have argued that the primary source of land for new housing should be brownfield sites, but that local circumstances must be examined through the planning process. My argument is that within the overall provision of green belt protection we urgently need a review of the green belt in central Oxfordshire, to provide for housing and the continued economic vitality of the city. Those such as Tristram Hunt and the Campaign to Protect Rural England who maintain blanket opposition to any building in the green belt fail to understand that although it has an important role in preventing urban sprawl it is also responsible, in places such as Oxford, for urban strangulation. Such cities face enormous pressures, because of an over-tight green belt, including the loss of valued green spaces inside the city, the proliferation of houses in multiple occupation and flats, which are destroying the character of residential areas, the environmental degradation and congestion caused by thousands of commuters crossing the green belt every day, and a catastrophic housing shortage, with a real risk that Oxford and places like it will become affordable only to a small elite. Mr. Hunt suggested in his article that developing part of the green belt mightâ€œbutter up the Home Builders Federationâ€. My message to him is that it would alleviate the suffering and distress of families who live in overcrowded conditions, whose children cannot live in the city they grew up in, and would do something to help those in temporary or inadequate privately rented accommodation. I urge my hon. Friends in Government to be resolute and energetic in the drive for the new homes that we need, and, where the social, environmental and economic arguments point to the need for modest changes in the green belt, to get on and make them, using, of course, all the proper procedures, so that those whom we represent, who need and deserve decent housing, can get it.",47197,[],Housing,0,35,housing,721
2007-07-18,Housing,428,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) on securing the debate, and welcome my hon. Friend the Minister to his position. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) I also welcome the higher profile that housing has now secured, even if I do not necessarily welcome all the ways in which the issue is presented, including some that we heard from the hon. Gentleman. We look forward very much to next week's housing Green Paper as a further demonstration of the Government's renewed commitment to tackling what we all agree is both a crisis of affordable housing to buy and, particularly, a shortage of rented accommodation for people in housing need. It is important to understand the full range of reasons that have driven that level of housing need in recent years. We accept that there is now a backlog affecting housing provision, because of a decades-long failure of the house building industry to meet need. It was only two years ago that private sector house building fell to its lowest rate since 1926. The pent-up demand that is now in the system is in large part driven by that failure. Of course, in the social rented sector it is also driven by a near halving of supply in many areas of the country, because of the impact of the right to buy. We all support the right to buy. It represented, in many ways, the biggest shift of wealth to poorer people that has ever happened in this country. However, for decades we failed to replace the stock, and as a consequence the people occupying many of the properties that were sold under the right to buy are no longer of the same profile as those who seek social rented housing. They are the ones who have borne the brunt of the impact. I think that all Labour Members recognise also-I am sure that we shall hear more about this, Mr. Cummings, if my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), who chairs the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, catches your eye-that there has been a rise in demand, which is driven by several factors. Those include, certainly, household change and the growth of single person households, the impact of the buy-to-let market and second home ownership, which have also had a significant impact on housing provision, and, indeed, to a certain extent, migration. I, certainly, have no difficulty with discussing the impact of migration on housing, but, of course, this is not a debate on migration, and it is important that we try to focus only on the implications for housing. However, let us be very clear about who these people are, and why, in certain cases, we have a housing obligation to them. Primary immigration to this country has not occurred for decades. People arriving in this country are doing so through a number of routes, and some of them are entitled to housing, particularly social housing, but many, of course, are not. In my constituency, I have seen the impact of immigration through the refugee and asylum routes. I invite the hon. Gentleman, and anyone else who doubts the legitimacy of the housing claims of people in that situation, to come and meet some of those individuals, and to tell me that they do not have a reasonable claim to social housing. Under this blanket description of migration and its impact on housing, we are in grave danger of forgetting human beings: who they are, what their circumstances are and the fact that, in many cases, they have come from the worst places and circumstances in the world. We have an absolute obligation to ensure that their needs are met.",47197,[],Housing,0,36,housing,627

2007-07-18,Housing,430,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. One need only look at London's public services, and hospitality and retail industries to see that that is the case. The statistics, of course, bear that out. Setting aside asylum seekers who, of course, do not qualify for social housing, as well as those who have had a claim for asylum accepted, and become refugees and British citizens, many migrants simply do not have a claim to social housing. That is often forgotten given this blanket acceptance that migrants can arrive off the boat or through the channel tunnel and immediately be given priority on the housing waiting list; and I am afraid that quite often that mythology is consciously stirred up, which causes enormous damage to community cohesion. The truth is that competition for social rented housing has come about because the number of people-there has been a relatively modest increase-seeking social housing are being squashed into an ever reducing number of social rented tenancies. If, through the additional investment that we are looking forward to in the comprehensive spending review and proposals in the housing Green Paper, we can redress some of that shortfall, not only will we meet the desperate housing needs of the homeless and those living in seriously over-crowded housing, but we will do something very important for community cohesion.",47197,[],Housing,0,38,housing,222

2007-07-18,Housing,432,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"The number of times that I have said in this place that I am personally disappointed that the building of social housing has not been a higher priority for the Government would probably run into three figures. I think that it should have been a priority, but unfortunately that has not been the case, although in fairness to the Government they have been dealing with a decades-long backlog of housing in poor condition, because it was neglected by the previous Administration, and billions have been spent on the decent homes initiative, which has improved the quality of life for tens of thousands in my constituency. Not everything can be a priority at the same time, but I would have liked to have seen more house building. We are now seeing, however, an extension of house building in London. I welcome very much the fact that the Mayor of London has given housing such a high priority; his housing strategy is driving forward additional housing construction. However, I ask my hon. Friend, the Minister, to keep his eye on the ball, because some local councils, particularly Conservative ones, are saying, on the one hand, â€œWe want more house building,â€ but, on the other hand, when it comes to house building in their local areas, they are saying, â€œNo, we are putting up the signs. We are full here and we do not want any more homes.â€ Sadly, that has been exacerbated since a number of councils became Conservative-controlled last year following the London elections.

2007-07-18,Housing,433,Andrew Slaughter,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend has made exactly my point, and I hope that the Minister will address it in his closing remarks. If the onus again is to be put on councils to build houses-we welcome that commitment-what do the Government intend to do about Conservative councils such as Wandsworth borough council, which is building about 12 per cent. affordable housing, and Hammersmith and Fulham council, which is halving the targets for affordable housing in its borough? Fuelled by the sort of inflammatory remarks that we hear from Opposition Members, there is a willingness to decrease the amount of social housing, rather than to increase it.",47197,[],Housing,0,41,housing,105
2007-07-18,Housing,434,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"I believe that the last period for which we have figures showed that my council in Westminster achieved only 21 per cent. of housing building at the affordable end of the spectrum, against a target of 50 per cent. We need not just more house building, but more that is not at the luxury end of the market. Luxury house building was one of the reasons that even properties being built were not providing homes for first-time buyers and those who do not have hundreds of thousands of pounds to spend on their own homes. Supply is the key to resolving many of these problems, and we need a grown-up contribution from politicians of all parties and councils. We cannot build houses in the abstract; they have to be built in communities. Local councils and politicians need to show some leadership, step up to the plate, demand sustainability and ensure that facilities are in place to support those communities. They must also take on the leadership role to ensure more homes. I have one or two other quick points: although supply is the key, the Government need to do a lot more on the demand side of the equation. I am not with the hon. Member for Shipley and some of his proposals, but we must ensure that we have a home swap system that actually works. Many people want to exchange their own homes, but we have not had in place for a long time, I am afraid, an effective mechanism that allows people choice and flexibility in moving between homes. We need also proper investment in measures that allow those under-occupying to trade properties for ones that they want. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in homes too large, strictly speaking, for their household size. Those are their homes and nobody should force them to move, but many of them would move if an option were available that met their needs and they were given an incentive. A financial incentive of a meaningful size would be a considerably cheaper strategy than house building. I am afraid that it beggars belief that we have not managed to crack that particular nut. I, and many of my colleagues, were very relieved when the recent John Hills inquiry into social housing rejected the siren calls for an end to the security of tenancies for people in social housing. However, it was alarming once again to see a report launched this morning by the Smith Institute, which flags up the possibility of ending the security of tenure. That report opened with the words:â€œShelter and security are the most basic of human needsâ€. And so say all of us. It made other good points:â€œThe government should stop talking up home ownership as the only solutionâ€-to housing pressures-â€œand support the rapid expansion of the rented sector and social housing in particular.â€So there is much to commend. However, the report went on to say, alarmingly, that aâ€œsimple reapplication for tenancy every five yearsâ€would ensure that those who remained eligible for social rented accommodation would remain in that accommodation. Presumably, if they were not eligible, they would be out on their ear. That must be resisted. It would be a disaster of epic proportions for those people who are often the most vulnerable in society, many of whom have been down the homelessness route, if they thought that they had a home for life and the rug was pulled out from under them. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to say that that proposal is unacceptable and would damage only those people who need most assistance. The current measure has been a long time coming, but we need more measures than simply the expansion of social housing and house building generally-which the Government have announced-including measures to tackle demand. Let us get on with that task and ensure that local councils are part of the solution and not part of the problem. Above all, let us not scapegoat individuals, be they homeless families, people in housing need or immigrants, as the sole cause of what is actually a very complex problem.",47197,[],Housing,0,42,housing,689

2007-07-18,Housing,436,Jeremy Corbyn,Lab,False,"I will abide by your suggestion, Mr. Cummings. I welcome the debate and the fact that a Green Paper comes out next week. I hope that that Green Paper will at last enable the corner to be turned on the housing crisis in this country. I also hope that it will at last level the playing field for tenants of council estates or any other council tenant, so that the fourth option will be accepted and it will be legitimate for tenants to vote for an arm's length management organisation, for a private finance initiative, for a stock transfer or to remain as council tenants and receive exactly the same investment and treatment that is so necessary for them. I pay tribute to the Government for the amount of money that has been put into improving existing stock. My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) is correct to say that that has been a major priority and it has meant a real change in the lives of many people who now have new kitchens, new roofs, new windows and new heating systems. There has been fundamentally a great improvement. That issue was sadly neglected by the Conservative Government in all those 18 years. There has been a major improvement and a major step forward. The area that I represent, like that of my hon. Friend, is inner-city London, where the housing crisis is most acute. I hope that the Green Paper will recognise that unless a substantial number of council properties are built in the areas of highest housing stress, we will all pay a price. More than 900,000 children in this country live in grossly overcrowded accommodation. The effect on their lives is dramatic. They underachieve at school, they over-attend at doctors' surgeries and hospitals, and they overachieve in crime and social disorder. Teenage children growing up in overcrowded flats on estates or anywhere else simply cannot socialise at home. Therefore they go out, and all the other problems emanate from that. If we want to improve social cohesion in our society, the best way to do that is through huge investment in the housing needs of the very poorest and most vulnerable people in our society. The current crisis means that local authorities cannot house people in normal council housing or with registered social landlords or housing associations, because there is nowhere for them to go. Instead, they are put in private rented accommodation, most of which is paid for through housing benefit. I shall give an example. This morning, I visited a family living in a one-bedroomed flat-two teenage children, one small child and the parents were all sharing one tiny bedroom. The flat was damp, mice-infested and leaked, and the extraction equipment of the restaurant down below pumped straight into the bedroom windows. That is a private rented flat. The rent is Â£780 a month, all of which is paid through housing benefit. In other words, the public sector is paying Â£780 a month for a family to live in absolute misery. The only beneficiaries from that are the private sector landlords. It is simply an insane form of investment. How much better would it be to put money into bricks and mortar and build new places, rather than subsidising slum landlords, who exist all over London at present? I hope that when the housing Green Paper comes out, we will understand the absolute priority that should be attached to doing that. I hope that the Green Paper, in recognising housing needs, will also recognise that many people living in the private rented sector, who do not necessarily depend on benefits to stay there but who are paying a very high rent, look to have some form of control and security-some form of secure future. In my constituency, there has been a very big increase in buy to rent. That means that many people are living unstable and insecure lives. Some form of security is needed for people living in that situation. As I have only five minutes in which to speak, my last point will be on registered social landlords and housing associations. I recognise that RSLs have built quite a lot of places, although unfortunately nowhere near enough, as councils have not built anything over the past few years. There are questions about the management of housing associations, the efficiency of that management and the accountability of those who manage housing associations. I hope that the Green Paper will look towards a degree of accountability in that respect, because many of my constituents have real problems with housing associations, and housing associations themselves have financial problems that too often they solve by selling off vacant flats that are desperately needed for the social sector. I hope that the Government will recognise that yes, we have had great achievements in improving existing council stock, but we must provide new homes for social rent. I say that because 75 or 80 per cent. of people in my constituency have no chance whatever of buying anywhere. The only route out of misery and poverty for them is through the provision of good-quality social housing through the local authorities. I hope that the Green Paper will recognise that and that we will turn the corner and end the misery being experienced by so many people living in inner-city Britain at the present time.",47197,[],Housing,0,44,housing,901
2007-07-18,Housing,437,Phyllis Starkey,Lab,False,"I shall use my constituency as an example of the way in which economic growth, a thriving economy, migration and housing are interlinked-not in the negative way that the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) described, but in an extremely positive way. Milton Keynes, as everyone knows, is a new city; it is 40 years old this year, but is still relatively new. It has been an immensely successful place, largely, I have to say, because of where it is, which is absolutely the right place to attract industry without any public subsidy at all. As a result, over the past decade 35,500 jobs have been created in Milton Keynes, and obviously that has required the creation of housing for the individuals working in Milton Keynes, but even so we have net inward migration daily, according to the 2001 census, of 16,000 people. I am sure that the figure is much bigger now, but I do not actually have a hard figure. We still have considerably more jobs than houses. Nevertheless, over the past year Milton Keynes topped the league in the south-east for the number of houses that were built. Last year, it was 1,857 houses-nearly twice the number for the second-placed town, which is Basingstoke-and 777 of those were for housing associations. The majority would have been for shared ownership, but a significant number would have been social rented housing. We are creating jobs and building new houses. On the whole, Milton Keynes is a huge success. It is a place that people like living in. It has many lovely green spaces. I never tire of reminding the House that it is built on greenfield land-what was low-grade agricultural land-and that the biodiversity level in Milton Keynes, as evidenced by surveys of animals, insects and plants, is hugely greater now than it was when it was the monoculture that pervades across most of the rest of that bit of Buckinghamshire. Milton Keynes is green, it is a nice place to live, and people choose to go there because they like it. It is also a city that is built on migration. There are, obviously, people living there who were born there, but the vast majority of people in Milton Keynes, including me, have come from somewhere else. They have come either from somewhere else in the UK-many are from London-or from outside it. That has added to the vitality and innovative nature of Milton Keynes and is a huge asset to the whole community of Milton Keynes. It is not a deficit; it is an asset. We as a country should regard migration in that way-as an asset. Apart from the fact that we get new skills and new people, we are also redressing the rather bizarre demographic balance of our population, which, because we are living longer, is very overburdened-if I may use that phrase, as an elderly person myself nearly-with people who are moving into retirement and therefore need people of working age to pay taxes to keep them in the manner to which we have all become accustomed. That is partly what the migrant population is doing. It is redressing our demographic imbalance and ensuring that we have a thriving economy so that those of us who are moving into retirement or are retired have some hope of having a decent retirement because there will be a decent working population paying taxes. Notwithstanding the success that is Milton Keynes, there is still a huge demand for market housing, shared housing and particularly for social rented housing. The effect of that on families can be extremely detrimental. I was mildly amused by the hon. Gentleman's comment that we should do something about family breakdown as that would reduce the need for housing. If we do not build more housing, there will be more family breakdown, because nothing is more conducive to family breakdown than families living in the sorts of situations that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) described, of which we are all aware from our constituencies-certainly we Labour Members are, anyway. There are families living in wholly unsuitable accommodation, usually in the private sector although there is sometimes overcrowding in the social sector, and paying enormous housing costs on top of that, so they are living in poor conditions and are under severe financial stress. I seem to have overrun, but I want to throw another point into the pot about infrastructure. The next stage of development in Milton Keynes is a wonderful example of how the private and public sectors can work together to come up with a solution to deal with the infrastructure problem-the Milton Keynes infrastructure tariff, which is sometimes called a roof tax. We have been able to do that because we have a forward plan for the next 10 years and we know what infrastructure will be required with schools and so on. There is a list, which we can cost and then divvy up between the number of houses that are going to be built, which comes out at Â£18,500 per house. All the developers are happy to pay their share through section 106 because they know what it is being spent on and that the developers at the front-end will pay the same as those at the end. They know that, between them all, they will get the infrastructure that is required, thanks to the Treasury front-loading it as well, so that our schools are built before the houses are built. That model benefits everyone, and could be followed. Other local authorities should consider proper ways of using section 106.",47197,[],Housing,0,45,housing,937

2007-07-18,Housing,439,Andrew Love,Lab,False,"I congratulate the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) on securing this debate, but I suggest that there might have been a slight mismatch between the title of the debate and his contribution. I welcome the Minister to his new role and congratulate the Government on placing housing at the top of their agenda, as the hon. Gentleman said at the start of the debate. The issue at the forefront is making housing affordable for the many and not just the few. Members on both sides of the House look forward to next week's statement and Green Paper. Of course, there are demand issues, which we have talked about a little, but I think that the focus will primarily be on long-term supply, because such issues have developed over a long period. We can all remember back to the '50s and '60s, when it was not unusual for 300,000 houses to be built in a year. The Government are saying, and I agree wholeheartedly, that we need a significant and sustained increase in supply. The figure of 3 million houses has been mentioned, which I welcome as a recognition of the need that exists. We are also talking about a planning Bill to speed up the development process, and about partnerships between Departments in order to assemble the land that will make all that possible. We are doing all that in the context of trying to protect the environment and to build mainly on brownfield land. I had a great deal of sympathy with the call of my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) for greater flexibility. We all know the problems: we face an acute housing shortage, and it is simple to see why. We are producing roughly 160,000 to 180,000 new homes a year, but household formation, of whatever sort, is running at 220,000 a year, so there is an enormous need out there. It is not just about first-time buyers, although they do face significant problems. In London, the average deposit for a first-time buyer is about Â£40,000. How many people can afford that? They are having to take on mortgages of five to six times their income. Such levels have not been seen since the 1980s, and it is tough out there for many first-time buyers. Many people cannot afford to own their own house, and there are 500,000 overcrowded homes in the country. We all know the impact that that has on health, education and children's future prospects. Some 90,000 people are homeless or in temporary accommodation, and I welcome the Government's commitment to halving that number in the next few years. Given the enormous need out there, when people say, â€œYes, we need to build more homes, but let's not have too many or have them in my area,â€ I wonder how they would answer the question of how first-time buyers are to get on to the property ladder. What do they say about people who are homeless? The case has been made that we need to increase supply; indeed, it was made by Kate Barker in her report, which said specifically that the level of market housing is relatively stable. The problem has primarily and most acutely been with the level of building of social, rented accommodation, which is at a quarter of that in the '50s, '60s and '70s. We all know why that happened, and we need to respond. The Government have responded in some ways. They have recognised and increased the provision of social, rented accommodation in the past few years, particularly this year, but we need to do more if we are to solve our housing problem. Cambridge university has carried out several studies on housing, and it suggests that we need 10,000 to 20,000 additional new homes per year. I do not suggest that those figures should be a target, but I understand that the Select Committee has endorsed them as a place to start, at least. We must recognise that there is a great deal more to do, and that there are ways of dealing with these matters. We should use more modern construction methods to build homes more quickly. I hope that the mythical Â£60,000 house that the previous Deputy Prime Minister used to talk about can still become a reality. We also need to think about having more family-sized accommodation rather than the one and two-bedroom units that seem to be churned out. Infrastructure has been mentioned. We must all recognise that the sustainability of the communities that we are creating has to be a major priority-my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East touched on that important issue. If we are to balance all the different aspects, we need to take regional factors into account. The Select Committee discussed that issue, and others have commented on it. The housing provision issues in London differ from those in the wider south-east or in Oxford. We need to take on board local opinion, knowledge and experience. The regional housing boards have an important role to play if we are to get the balance right regarding the type of accommodation that we are delivering.",47197,[],Housing,0,47,housing,862

Family breakdown is an issue, but his party's proposals for a tax break for married couples, irrespective of whether or not they have children, will hardly solve the problem, just as it did not in the 1970s.

Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) talked about the Select Committee report and gave the example of 80,000 people from London moving out to the south and the same number of immigrants moving in. The 80,000 people moving into London would not constitute 80,000 households, because many of them are young, single, eastern Europeans coming to work temporarily, for two or three years, before going home with their savings, and they are living in rented flats in multiple occupation. I can think of a small number of Polish workers who are doing the same thing even in Chesterfield, which has a small immigrant population. In my constituency, immigration accounts for 3 per cent. or less of the population, and many of those people are second or third-generation English people. A huge housing problem exists even there. The waiting list for social housing in Chesterfield has trebled in the past 10 years, and that has nothing to do with immigration. There is a housing crisis, so, like the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), I am pleased that this debate is taking place. Like him, I have been raising the issue since I entered Parliament-that was six years ago. The hon. Member for Shipley rightly said that there was a need for more private house building. The home ownership figure in this country is 71 per cent.-the highest in Europe-and it is difficult to see how much higher that can be pushed. The private housing market is overheated and under-supplied; first-time buyers and key workers cannot buy. Last week, in response to a statement by the Prime Minister, one hon. Member gave the example of an affordable flat in London that went on the market at Â£300,000. That makes a nonsense of much of the talk about providing affordable housing for people to buy. Unless we do something about the housing market, we are in danger of entering another negative equity slump such as the one that we experienced in the 1980s and early 1990s. Mortgage debt has increased by 150 per cent.; lending is at three to three-and-a-half times people's income; interest rates have increased and are still climbing; the number of people in debt has doubled, and the number of repossessions has trebled this year compared with last year; and the fixed rates for the mortgages of 2 million people will end in the next 18 months. Therefore, the problem will get much worse in the near future. Where will the new build come from to help us start to tackle the issue of the supply of houses for people to buy? The situation is not as bad as some people paint it: builders have a land bank for about 200,000 houses, which is a year's supply; identified brownfield sites will provide about 1 million houses; and there is scope for 1 million new housing premises over shops and commercial premises in cities and towns across the country. If we were to let councils have more flexibility and control, instead of having to respond to diktat from regional government offices and from London, they, too, would be able to bring more land on stream. My constituency contains brownfield sites that are waiting to be developed. It is doing a good job on brownfield sites. It also contains greenfield sites-not green belt sites-that were identified for housing nearly 30 years ago, but they are rightly not being brought into housing use until all the brownfield areas have been redeveloped. The greatest gap in the speech made by the hon. Member for Shipley was on the need for social housing-I believe that he allocated just six words to that. The waiting list for social housing has increased from 1 million to 1.6 million in the 10 years of this Government, which is a disgrace. Some 1 million children live in overcrowded accommodation, and 130,000 children live in unsuitable, temporary accommodation. Councils have been forced to privatise their housing stock, and are starved of funds if they do not. Only 4,000 council houses were built in the past 10 years, compared with 400,000 in the first 10 years of even Mrs. Thatcher's Government. We are told that housing associations are the answer, but they have not even built enough houses every year in the past 10 years to replace the right-to-buy losses.",47197,[],Housing,0,49,housing,831

2007-07-18,Housing,443,Jacqui Lait,Con,False,"Thank you, Mr. Cummings, but I am not the Home Secretary. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) on securing this debate. The mere fact that there have been so many diverse contributions shows how interesting the House finds the subject of housing. I also congratulate the Minister on his first ministerial appearance in this Chamber. Perhaps he could take the message back to the House authorities that a full-day debate in Government time on housing would be worth the investment. We are beginning to drill down into what the issues are. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) pointed out that longevity is one of the issues involved in the demand for housing. I am approaching my 60th birthday. I maintain that 60 is the new 40, but I am a victim of longevity. Several hon. Members referred to single-household formation and family breakdown, and those are also relevant issues. I commend to all hon. Members the extensive report by the Commission on Social Justice, because its analysis is spot on and its recommendations will help us to move towards healing many places in our society. I do not think that anyone disagreed with the view that migration was part of the reason for increased demand. There are many forms of migration, including internal migration, which the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West mentioned. We are also well aware of positive inward migration into this country from other countries. It is accepted by the Government and is good for the economy. I do not have a problem with it, provided that it is controlled, that there are proper border police, and that we have clear knowledge about whom we are welcoming into this country. The previous Home Secretary said that the Home Office was â€œnot fit for purposeâ€. Part of the reason for that was that the immigration and nationality directorate was unable to deal with the flow of migrants and the people that we have here. That has been confirmed by a written answer that I received recently from the Home Office, saying that it would be five years before many cases will be sorted out. If people wait five years for a decision, not only will we have a dislocated society; we will also be unable to take the greatest advantage of those who are legitimately here, so that they can get into the economy. Like everyone else, I look forward to next week's Green Paper. I hope that it is in better shape than that reported by Peter Riddell in The Times, that there is meat and substance to it, and that it addresses the issue of the green belt. Last week, the Secretary of State indicated that she was thinking of not defending the green belt, but by that very afternoon No. 10 had issued a denial. I hope that the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) has noted that denial and that the green belt will remain inviolate. Yesterday, a statement was made on ending the regional assemblies and giving control over housing to even more undemocratic organisations-the regional development agencies. I must declare an interest: my husband is not only leader of East Sussex county council but deputy chairman of the South East England Development Agency. There are issues on which he and I do not necessarily have to agree. This is already on the record, but I believe that SEEDA or any other development agency making any decisions about housing in the south-east takes away from local people control over their own environment. The best way to get people to acknowledge that they want housing is for them to own that decision, rather than for it to be dictated by central control, as is already the leitmotif of this new Government. After three weeks, we have gone back to the old socialism.",47197,[],Housing,0,51,housing,648
2007-07-18,Housing,444,Iain Wright,Lab,False,"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for my first Westminster Hall debate as a Minister, Mr. Cummings. You are my next-door neighbour in terms of parliamentary constituencies. I congratulate the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) on securing an important debate. I like and respect him too. We worked well together on the Modernisation Committee. This has been a fascinating and important debate, reflecting the importance of the subject. Its energy, vibrancy and passion have made it extremely interesting, although at times I thought that I was in a debate on immigration and that I had been transported back in time to the 1950s. It is important that we have had this debate to ensure that this issue is at the top of the political agenda. I do not have much time left in which to speak. I want to respond to all the points made by hon. Members. If I do not manage to do so, with their permission, I shall write to them. As a starting point, it is worth setting out where we started. Over the past 10 years, a great deal of improvement has been made in housing. Home owners have seen the value of their properties increase, thanks in some degree to sustained economic growth, stability and an implicit recognition on the part of home owners that interest rates will remain historically low and stable for the foreseeable future. The number of households living in non-decent housing in the social sector has fallen by more than 1 million. Concerted action means that homelessness is down by nearly 30 per cent., and the number of people sleeping rough has fallen from 1,850 on a single night in 1998 to just over 500 last year. Local authorities are also on course to halve the number of households living in temporary accommodation by 2010. A climate of economic growth and stability, unlike the boom and bust of previous decades, has led to 1 million more home owners over the past 10 years. I welcome that, because it is absolutely right-indeed, vital-that the Government facilitate such ambitions and aspiration for hard-working families. Most hon. Members who participated in the debate referred to demographics and how that squeezes demand. We have an ageing population, and more of us are living alone as a result of social changes, which produces a demand for new and rented homes. That imbalance is growing as demand rises faster than supply. As house prices have increased faster than wages, it has become increasingly difficult for young people to get on the housing ladder. It is important that we act now to ensure that present and future generations can access the housing market and reap the benefits of home ownership. Projections show that on average, from now until 2026, 223,000 additional households are needed each year. In 2006, 185,000 extra homes were delivered, giving a shortfall of almost 40,000 homes. Unless we act now to address the problem, the serious problems of affordability will continue to worsen, further pricing people out of the market. Let us be blunt. We cannot bury our heads in the sand, ignore the problem and hope that some other community will deal with the matter that Opposition Members have alluded to. A fundamental question-I do not think the Conservative party has addressed it-is how to ensure that our children, first-time buyers and young families will be able to afford homes in their own communities without relying on help from their families. Some families cannot tap into wealth. We must do something about that, and the Government are addressing the matter in a way that other parties are not. My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) and others rightly mentioned the imbalance in supply. In her review of housing supply, which was published in 2004, Kate Barker recognised that there had been an under-supply of new housing for many years, and called for a step change to address that. The Government's response in 2005 set out an ambition to increase the rate of new housing supply in England to 200,000 a year over the next decade, alongside a package of measures to reform the planning system, provide more social housing and protect the environment. I return to what I would like to see in housing, which is the biggest domestic issue facing this country, and facing aspiration and our ability to fulfil our potential as a country. There seems to be an issue, because Conservative Members say that they fully understand the need for housing and agree full scale that there is a need for extra housing, but not in their communities. That is reminiscent of the phrase,â€œLord, make me pure, but not yet.â€As my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) said, we need a grown-up discussion about how local authorities can engage properly in a regional and local debate about the availability of affordable and social housing in all our communities. The suggestion of putting up signs saying, â€œThis community is full upâ€-that is what the hon. Member for Shipley seemed to allude to-is unsustainable. Conservative Members must ensure that we have that grown-up debate, and facilitate and lead it in their communities. Tory MPs sign early-day motions saying that we cannot have more housing in their areas, such as Cambridgeshire and East Sussex, but that is simply wrong and does not help to fulfil the potential of those areas .",47197,[],Housing,0,52,housing,909

2007-07-23,Housing,177,Yvette Cooper,Lab,False,"With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement about housing supply. May I start by supporting the statement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and joining the many Members of the House who have expressed their sympathy to the thousands of families whose lives have been turned upside down by the unprecedented flooding affecting wide parts of the country. The Government are today publishing a housing Green Paper on affordable housing supply, setting out proposals to deliver the homes that Britain urgently needs today and for the future. The House should be proud of the huge steps forward that this country has taken in improving housing since 1997. There has been a two-thirds cut in rough sleeping, a Â£20 billion investment in social housing that has helped lift over a million children out of cold, poor or damp conditions, and economic stability that has given over a million more people the opportunity to become homeowners-but we also need to respond to new challenges. Demand for homes to buy or to rent is growing faster than supply, and homes are becoming less affordable as a result. Already many first-time buyers rely on the help of friends or family to get a foot on the ladder. It simply is not fair that their chance of owning their own home should depend so much on whether their parents or grandparents were homeowners before them. It is also not fair that children are still growing up in overcrowded or temporary accommodation, waiting for a settled home. Without further action, housing could become one of the greatest sources of social inequality in the next 20 years. In addition, we need to respond to the challenge of climate change. Our homes account for more than a quarter of national carbon emissions. We must provide greener, better designed housing for the future. As recent events have highlighted, it is vital to take steps to protect all our communities from flooding, and from the consequences of climate change in the future. In the face of these challenges, we propose strong action. First, we will build more homes to meet growing demand. The level of house building is at its highest for 17 years, but it is not enough. Moreover, without firm action there is no guarantee that growth will continue, as short-term market pressures mean that some developers have slowed starts this year. We believe that a total of 3 million new homes are needed by 2020, and we need to deliver 2 million of those by 2016. This must include new homes in the north as well as the south, as every region is seeing demand outstrip supply. In parts of the north we need additional affordable homes alongside areas of housing market renewal. Already locations for 1.6 million homes are identified in current regional plans, with up to a further 200,000 emerging in the new regional spatial strategies and in future revisions to them. This includes 650,000 homes in the growth areas such as the Thames Gateway and Milton Keynes. In addition, 45 towns and cities have already come forward with proposals for additional homes over the next 10 years in new growth points. Today we are inviting more councils to come forward to be new growth points, including, for the first time, councils in the north of England. We are also inviting bids for councils and developers to come forward with proposals for at least five new eco-towns. No one should be in any doubt about the historic scale of this vision. We are proposing the first new towns in 40 years, but with substantial improvements in environmental standards across the board. Further changes are needed to support the delivery of these homes. Providing enough land is vital, and councils need to identify 15 years' supply of appropriate land for housing, with continuing priority for sustainable brownfield land. We will not change the rules on strong greenbelt protection. We will introduce additional funding and incentives for councils and communities that are showing a lead in delivering growth through a new housing and planning delivery grant, a new Â£300 million community infrastructure fund and additional funding dedicated to high-growth areas. We are consulting on proposals to deter developers from seeking planning permission and then sitting on land without bringing forward new homes. We will also work across the Government to bring forward more brownfield land. I can announce that the Ministry of Defence has agreed to bring forward six sites with the potential for 7,000 homes, including sites at Aldershot and Chichester. The Department for Transport has also identified hundreds of potential sites for new homes. We will support local councils in setting up new local housing companies with partners to use their own land to build more homes. I can announce that 14 councils have already come forward to support that scheme. They estimate that in their areas alone they have the potential to deliver 35,000 homes on their land, with at least 17,500 of those homes being affordable homes. Better use also needs to be made of empty homes, including those left empty long-term by investors and speculators. Councils already have powers to take action, and we will look at the potential for additional incentives for them to do so. Secondly, although building more homes is crucial, they must also be better homes and more sustainable homes. In the 1960s, quality was sacrificed in the name of speed, and we must not make that mistake again. Today, our new homes must be part of well-designed and mixed communities with excellent local facilities, which means more family homes as well as parks and green spaces. With the urgent challenge of climate change, they must be greener homes built to the highest environmental standards. I confirm today that from 2016 all new homes will need to be zero carbon. We are the first country to set such an ambitious timetable, and I welcome the support of councils, green groups and developers across the country who have committed to working with us to make that happen. As well as helping to prevent climate change, we need to ensure that our homes are resilient to its consequences. Over centuries, many homes have been built in high-risk flood areas, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has set out immediate action to support the families suffering dreadfully from the extreme weather. Since 1997, we have progressively strengthened the rules on planning to protect homes from flooding, with much higher standards brought in last year. The new rules require councils to consult the Environment Agency, and where the Environment Agency says that the risk is too high and councils persist against that advice, we in government will be prepared to take over those decisions ourselves. We will also look further at what needs to be done to be ready for future challenges. Later this year, we will publish a new planning policy statement, which will require councils to plan more widely for the consequences of climate change. Thirdly, we believe that a decent home should be for the many and not only for the few. I can announce that we will invest Â£8 billion in increasing affordable housing over the next three years, a Â£3 billion increase compared with the previous spending review. That is on top of continuing investment in decent homes, including more than Â£2 billion on the arm's length management organisation programme over the next three years. We have listened to the evidence from Shelter and the National Housing Federation, which says that we need 70,000 affordable homes a year, of which 50,000 should be new social housing. I can announce that by 2010-11 we will deliver more than 70,000 new affordable homes a year. By 2010-11, we will deliver 45,000 new social homes a year with a goal of 50,000 homes in the next spending review. That is a 50 per cent. increase in new social housing over a three-year period, and it will more than double the amount of social housing in a six-year period. We will also deliver 25,000 new shared ownership homes through expanding existing programmes. In addition, we will look to support tens of thousands of additional shared ownership homes through public sector land and local housing companies, and we will set out further details later in the year. As rural areas face particular pressures, we will set a specific target for increasing affordable homes in rural areas later this year after consultation with the regional assemblies. We want to see more work by local councils, housing associations and the private sector to increase affordable housing both to buy and to rent. We are announcing today the first 10 arm's length management organisations-ALMOs-and local authority special venture vehicles approved to bid for social housing grant in order to build council homes. We are also consulting on changes to the rules on the treatment of rents and receipts from new homes, which would give councils more flexibility to build on their land, within responsible public finance rules. We also believe that first-time buyers need more flexible and competitive products. The Treasury is consulting on new ways to support more affordable long-term fixed-rate mortgages. We have also commissioned further work, led by Bryan Pomeroy, on expanding private sector shared equity products, and we will launch new shared equity products next year. In the meantime, we will, from today, offer a new 17.5 per cent. Government equity loan for key workers and other priority first-time buyers. Taken together, these proposals represent not just the most significant programme of house building for decades but an ambitious, positive response to the growing challenges that many people face in their day-to-day lives. To deliver, we will need a expanded skilled work force, and the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills will lead work to expand construction apprenticeships and work with partners in the sector to raise skills. We know there is no quick fix to the issues that we face: building more homes takes time. However, this must be a shared endeavour. Central Government are today setting a bolder framework for the future, but we will achieve our goals only if those at regional and local levels, in the public, private and third sectors, and in local communities, all play their part in supporting the homes we need. Building the sustainable homes needed by young people today and by future generations is a test of our commitment to supporting people's aspirations and to achieving social justice. I commend these proposals to the House.",47236,[],Housing,0,1,housing,1777
2007-07-23,Housing,178,Grant Shapps,Con,False,"I am grateful to the Minister for advance sight of her statement, and I join her in expressing sympathies to all the thousands of victims of flooding in recent days. The last housing Green Paper in 2000 pledged to be theâ€œfirst comprehensive review of housing for 23 yearsâ€and offeredâ€œaction to help first time buyersâ€and â€œdecent homes for allâ€. That rhetoric has not exactly been matched by reality. Home ownership has fallen for the first time since records began, numbers of first-time buyers are at their lowest since 1980, housing waiting lists have grown by 60,000, and less social housing is being built every year under this Government than under the Major or the Thatcher Government. The Prime Minister's higher taxes have made it harder than ever to get on the housing ladder. The Minister cannot deny that the average first-time buyer now has to pay Â£1,500 in stamp duty, but is she also aware that the average first-time buyer in London pays Â£8,000 in stamp duty? Meanwhile, her own Department's research into the Conservative right-to-buy policy praises it asâ€œone of the most successful housing policies in increasing owner occupation and creating mixed communities.â€However, right-to-buy discounts have continued to be squeezed. Will not her ongoing refusal to offer the right to buy to housing association tenants undermine her own goals of creating a greater social mix within communities? Today's Green Paper talks about 70,000 more affordable homes, but why should we trust the Government when their own social homebuy scheme, which is meant to help social tenants to get on to the housing ladder, is failing? On page 82 of the Green Paper, the Minister admits that of 1,400 housing associations, only 78 have offered the scheme. In April this year, she came to the House and told us that only 33 houses had been sold under the scheme. Perhaps she can give us an update today. We absolutely accept the need to build more houses. I will come to that in a moment. We will lend our cross-party support to measures that build sustainable eco-friendly communities on brownfield sites. We welcome the use of surplus public sector land. However, does the Minister accept that with the NHS in London already conducting estate audits with a view to closing hospitals and selling off land, the public will be worried that more homes will come only at the expense of fewer hospitals? Does she accept that her Government's policies of closing accident and emergency and maternity departments will in any case hinder sustainable growth of local communities? We heard last week that regional assemblies are to be sidelined, but is not criticism from regional assemblies the real reason why their powers are being seized? Page 30 of the Green Paper says that regional spatial strategies will be reviewed by 2011. Will the Minister promise the House that none of those regional plans will involve the deletion of green belt protection? In my constituency, we are running a campaign called â€œNo Way To 10kâ€-in other words, no way to 10,000 houses. However- Wait for it. We fully back the building of 6,000 houses, and have already undertaken to start building them. It is simply the case that 10,000 will overload our local infrastructure, at a time when the local hospital is being closed. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether the local Labour party is wrong to back my campaign. We are concerned that the Government's regional building targets are unsustainable. Has the Minister read the Roger Tym report, commissioned by her own Department, into increasing building targets in the south-east? It says that the Government's building plans willâ€œhave a negative impact on the character of the countrysideâ€and the green belt. Trunk roads will be unable to cope, leading to congestion, pollution and soaring carbon dioxide emissions- Labour Members may say, â€œRubbish,â€ but I am talking about the Government's own report. There will be increasedâ€œpressure to develop in these areas of flood riskâ€, so we can expect more flash floods of the type that we have experienced in recent days and weeks. Yesterday, the BBC reported that the Green Paper stated that it is â€œnot realisticâ€ to prevent development taking place in areas at risk of flooding. Will the Minister confirm that that wording is no longer in the Green Paper, and how does that square with the 2005 agreement struck between insurers and the Government that areas at risk of flood will be insured only provided that the Government limit such developments? Labour is not planning the eco-towns of the 21st century; it is planning the sink estates of tomorrow. The Conservative party has been responsible for most of the progressive housing policies of the past 50 years. We built more social housing, spread home ownership and created mixed communities. Does the Minister agree that to solve the housing crisis, it is vital to end the ham-fisted nature of top-down, Whitehall-driven targets? Instead, we should switch to the empowering of local communities to build the homes that stand the test of time.",47236,[],Housing,0,2,housing,840

I congratulate him on his appointment to the Conservative Front Bench, and his first appearance at the Dispatch Box. He was not here for our oral questions two weeks ago. We wondered where he was-and I understand that he was masterminding the by-election in Ealing, Southall. I congratulate him on that particular result, too. My guess is that some of his colleagues sitting behind him might wish he had taken his parliamentary responsibilities a little more seriously, and joined us in the House instead. I look forward to debating the issues with the hon. Gentleman; I know that he has a long-standing interest in housing. He referred to his â€œNo Way To 10kâ€ campaign against additional housing in Welwyn Hatfield. I am sorry that his new appointment has forced him to change his website. Before he took up his new post, two weeks ago, it read:â€œWe believe you cannot build your way out of a housing crisis.â€He has deleted that since, and the website now says:â€œwhilst building more properties is obviously vitalâ€. That is a rather rapid turnaround in one paragraph, in the space of just a couple of weeks. The hon. Gentleman raised a few points, and criticised our record. However, to have lifted 1 million children out of bad housing-cold and damp homes-through the decent homes programme is something of which the House should be proud, and of which his party should feel ashamed. His party left more than 1 million children in appalling housing by failing to deliver proper decent homes, and the council housing improvements that were needed. The hon. Gentleman asked about the Association of British Insurers, which backs the new guidance that was introduced last year, with new, tougher requirements on flooding and planning for flooding He mentioned the Roger Tym report, which was commissioned to inform the planning process. The process needs to be properly informed if sensible decisions are to be taken. In the end, we must recognise a national collective responsibility to provide for the homes that the future needs. The hon. Gentleman gave us warm words. He said that his party accepted the need for more homes; but will he back 240,000 zero-carbon homes for 2016?

2007-07-23,Housing,180,Paul Holmes,LibDem,False,"I thank the Minister for advance sight of the Green Paper, although as I had 55 minutes to read 128 pages I am sure that I will have missed some of the detailed nuances of policy. I have a few points on which I request clarification. I want, first, to welcome the intent of the Green Paper. At last, after 10 years, the Government recognise the scale of the housing crisis over which they have presided: with 71 per cent. home ownership-the highest rate in Europe-our market is under-supplied with land and houses and overheated in terms of demand and reckless mortgage lending. We approach the dangers of another wave of negative equity, such as we experienced in the '80s and early '90s. Mortgage debt is up 150 per cent., people are falling behind on mortgages at a rate double that of last year, and repossessions have trebled since last year. That is just the start: 2 million people on fixed-term mortgages with low interest rates will experience a hike in rates in the next 18 months. First-time buyers and key workers cannot get on to the housing ladder in 93 per cent. of urban areas. The Minister spoke of the highest rate of building for 17 years, but she failed to point out that that is from a record low base, with the 2001 rate one of the lowest on record. If the ownership crisis was due to Government neglect, the rented housing crisis is directly due to dogmatic Government policy. In the past 10 years, the Government have ended council house building and starved councils of funds, despite tenants' choice to stay with the council. Housing associations have managed to build only half the stock that is needed to replace right-to-buy losses, and only about a third of what the Barker review says is needed. The result is that waiting lists have soared from 1 million to 1.6 million. We welcome the Green Paper's proposed increases in social housing, but will the Minister confirm that despite all the media trailing by her and by the Prime Minister, the small print means more of the same for the 140 councils whose tenants have democratically chosen to stay with them? Will she confirm that the small print says that any extra money will go to housing associations and 60 arm's length management organisations, and that just a small number of councils will be able to launch partnerships with the private sector on the basis of special Government selection? Will she confirm that it is still proposed to rob the 140 councils that have retained their housing stock of 75 per cent. of right-to-buy money, and that most of those councils will lose up to an average of 25 per cent. of their council rents, whereas a housing association taking over that stock would be allowed to keep the entire sum? The housing and regeneration Bill is supposed to put tenants at the heart of social housing; why, then, in the Green Paper, is the Minister ignoring and punishing those very tenants for exercising their democratic choice to stay with the council as landlord? The Barker review said that 56,000 new social houses a year would be needed if we were to make any impact on the growing waiting list for social housing. Currently, housing associations have managed an average of about 25,000 houses a year. The Green Paper proposes an increase, by 2011, to only 45,000.

Finally, will the Minister explain why, despite all the talk at other times in recent weeks of restoring democracy and autonomy to local authorities, the Green Paper represents the imposition of yet more central control, with the Government dictating what houses will be built, where, by which councils and in partnership with whom?

That is a substantial increase in social housing and includes councils, too, being able to build homes. However, many areas will find it more cost-effective to do that in partnership with housing associations or private developers. We have said specifically-it is in the consultation paper-that we are approving ALMOs and councils with special venture vehicles to build council homes and bid for social housing grant in order to do so. The important issue is about providing the additional homes that we need. We want the flexibility for housing associations, councils and private developers to be able to contribute to the building of more social and shared ownership housing. Local housing companies offer a great opportunity to do so. The decent homes programme continues in its current form, and all bar one council have now identified ways of meeting that standard, including as a result of the substantial investment that has gone to individual councils. We have the most ambitious target to get to zero carbon of any country in the world. The target includes standards not only for heating and power, but for appliances in the home. The standards are extremely ambitious. We will need improvements in technology and strong co-operation between local councils and private developers to meet them.

I thank the Speaker for granting me permission to introduce this debate, and I welcome the Minister to his place to listen and respond to my constituents' concerns. I also thank the Leader of the House for granting permission for Westminster Hall debates to take place on this final Tuesday before Christmas. In previous years, the habit has been to cancel today's debates, but in a very welcome decision, she has decided to allow them, which will permit another four and a half hours of parliamentary airtime in which a wide variety of concerns can be raised and drawn to the attention of Ministers. In the next 15 to 25 years, Kettering, which I have the privilege of representing, will face a challenge arising from the number of new houses that the Government say need to be built in the borough. That is causing problems for the local community because, I am sorry to say, the infrastructure needed to support that housing growth is not being delivered at the rate at which it should be. I received a letter from the leader of Kettering borough council, Councillor Jim Hakewill, which I shall read to the Chamber. He sums up very well the concerns of the local community about the so-called sustainable communities plan proposed by the Government and how it will apply to Kettering. He writes:â€œAs leader of Kettering Borough Council I would like to record my increasing concern as to the deliverability of the steep housing growth targets that have been allocated to our Borough as part of the Sustainable Communities Plan-Milton Keynes South Midlands growth area. We have welcomed National and Regional Ministers to Kettering as well as colleagues from the Government Office for the East Midlands, to see first hand the potential, but also the barriers for delivering the national housing growth targets in our Borough. Whilst we have been appreciative of the time and consideration given to our concerns, it is some five years since the announcement of the Sustainable Communities Plan. Whilst we have seen some support for our town centres via GAF fundingâ€-growth area funding-â€œwe have seen little evidence of deliverable infrastructure planning from government departments, let alone anything physically on the ground. If North Northamptonshire is to become a successful community of 400,000 people, it needs a university campus, road and rail infrastructure and business support. The clear agreement back in 2003 was that there would be a sequential approach based on infrastructure, jobs and homes. The bargain struck with local people at that time was that this would not just be a homes-led agenda to relieve pressures on the south east, but a genuine infrastructure approach which would deliver benefits to our existing residents, businesses and visitors. I am happy for you to deliver this letter and the message within it to those senior politicians who have it within their power to work across departments to deliver on that original commitment, infrastructure, jobs then housing.â€That is the dilemma that Kettering borough faces. Much of the infrastructure that Kettering needs is in the field of transport. I know that the Minister has no direct control over the Department for Transport, but it is crucial that his Department regularly engages with the DFT to deliver his sustainable communities plan. I pray in aid a recent comment made on the Floor of the House by the Secretary of State for Transport:â€œGiven my experience at the Department for Communities and Local Government and now at the Department for Transport, I can assure himâ€-the right hon. Lady was referring to another hon. Member-â€œthat the two Departments are joined at the hip when it comes to planning for more houses... It is essential that we build sufficient capacity so that people can travel by train, road, bus or however they want to move around. In that way, we can meet the needs of a growing population, and of those who will live in the houses yet to be built.â€- I took that as a reassurance that the Department for Transport and the Department for Communities and Local Government were joined at the hip in delivering the necessary infrastructure that communities such as Kettering require. In a letter written in August 2006, I was told by another DCLG Minister that the Departmentâ€œhas allocated significant funding to ensure that the necessary supporting infrastructure is provided at the same time as development goes aheadâ€. It would appear from the assurances given to my constituents that both Departments are committed to delivering the infrastructure that local communities such as Kettering require to ensure the scale of housing growth that the Government envisage.",47979,"['Written Answers to Questions', 'Communities and Local Government']",Housing,2,1,housing,783

I was disappointed to hear of the difficulties being experienced by him and his community over the lack of joined-up government in the delivery of the ongoing infrastructure required for growing communities. Part of the difficulty is that the Government's housing expansion agenda is so ambitious and aims to build so many houses in such a short time that it seems to have huge difficulty co-ordinating the delivery of the extra infrastructure and support services needed by those who will live in the houses. The very strong argument for Kettering is that, if the Government cannot fulfil their promise to put infrastructure first, they need to scale back their housing expansion plans; otherwise the result will be tens of thousands of new houses in north Northamptonshire, but a worse quality of life for those moving in to the new houses and for the existing residents, because the already groaning infrastructure endured by local people will be unable to cope. I am very disappointed that a similar situation seems to be arising in my hon. Friend's constituency. I am disappointed: this is not the first time that I have had to raise this issue in this Chamber. On 12 October 2005, in the first Westminster Hall debate that I secured after the last general election, I was delighted to raise these issues with the Minister's predecessor, now the Minister for the Environment, in a debate about overdevelopment in Northamptonshire. Overdevelopment is basically lots of houses without the infrastructure needed to support them. What disappoints me is that very little progress seems to have been made towards providing that infrastructure since I brought my constituents' concerns to the House on that occasion. I also had the privilege of securing another Westminster Hall debate, on 19 July 2006, on the problems of the A14, the major road that serves my constituency. Despite my raising those concerns with the then Transport Minister, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), plans to introduce proposals to improve that road have been put back since that debate. The theme of my remarks today is that the strategy of infrastructure, then jobs, then houses, which local people were promised, has not happened. In fact, realisation of the infrastructure commitments that were signalled now seems further away than it was in the first place. North Northamptonshire has been pre-eminent in the delivery of additional housing as part of the Government's sustainable communities plan. In the borough of Kettering, there are 36,000 houses. Under the Government's proposal, a statutory duty has been placed on the borough to make provision for an additional 13,100 houses by 2021. In other words, the borough will increase by one third, which must be one of the fastest growth rates of any community in the whole country-it is an extremely ambitious target. The four communities of Kettering, Corby to the north, Wellingborough to the south, and east Northamptonshire to the east form north Northamptonshire. Overall, the requirement is for an extra 52,100 houses in north Northamptonshire by 2021, as part of a county-wide increase of just under 100,000 houses by that date. By 2031 the population of Northamptonshire is set to rise from 660,000 people to just under 1 million. That rate of growth is unprecedented in the history of the county and of the borough of Kettering. Traditionally, Kettering has been a successful and thriving market town, which has evolved over the years and never had growth imposed upon it. Because it has evolved, it has a settled infrastructure that has served the community extremely well until now. Now, despite the rate of growth that is being imposed, it is increasingly unlikely that local people will receive the extra infrastructure that they require. In north Northamptonshire as a whole, 2,500 new homes are completed every year. The area forms part of the wider Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area, which delivers a higher rate of annual housing growth than that of the Thames Gateway, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) has raised concerns. However, developers, local councillors, residents and planners all agree that local growth on that scale will be sustainable only if there is sufficient investment in the associated infrastructure. An example of that is the supposed-yet to arrive-improvements to the A14. The A14 is a road of European significance. On maps in the European Commission, it runs from Dublin, through Wales and England, past Kettering to the east coast ports and then into Europe. An â€œEâ€ number is attached to it. Some 70,000 vehicles a day use it driving past Kettering, and the road is close to capacity. Everyone agrees that it is the major brake on housing expansion in north Northamptonshire, so the Highways Agency needs to introduce a proposal to sort out the capacity on that road. Currently, however, there are no proposals to do anything about it until 2016 or 2017. The plans that the Government have placed a duty on local councils to deliver are meant to be completed in 2021, but major improvements to that major road are not scheduled until almost the end of that programme. It is a perfect example of infrastructure not leading but following housing expansion. When I expressed local concerns about the A14 in the debate on 19 July, the then Transport Minister assured me that the Highways Agency was considering an options study of the road's Kettering bypass section, and that the agency would make proposals to him in due course. Unfortunately, the timetable continues to slip. February 2003, when the sustainable communities plan was published, was the first opportunity for local people to try to understand the imminent changes to their local community. In July 2003, the then Secretary of State for Transport, now the Chancellor of the Exchequer, responded to the recommendations of the then London to south midlands multi-modal study to widen the A14. In 2004, the Highways Agency appointed consultants Scott Wilson to work on the potential for widening the road, and throughout 2005 the agency issued a number of article 14 directions against housing developments in the locality on the basis that the proposed developments could not go ahead because the A14 did not have enough capacity to cope with them. In November 2005, however, at a north Northamptonshire summit, the agency advised local people that there was no automatic expectation that it would recommend investment in the A14 before 2021. I secured my parliamentary debate in July 2006, and later that year the A14 issues group was established, involving various Government agencies, the county council, the local planning unit and the Government office for the region; however, Kettering borough council was not invited. The important point is that DCLG, or perhaps it is the Department for Transport, often seems to forget that planning powers lie with local district councils. In November 2006, Kettering borough council granted planning permission for an office development on a site known as Cransley park, or â€œthe scrapyardâ€ to local people, at the entrance to Kettering from Northampton by the A14. The council was unaware, however, that the Government had established the A14 issues group. That site is now blighted because no one locally knows the proposed route of an offline extension to the A14, which seems to be the Highways Agency's favoured proposal. In yet another example of joined-up government, the local council, in all good faith, has granted planning permission for a development to create job opportunities in the borough, but because it was not involved in major transport decisions, the site is effectively blighted. In January 2007, the then Transport Minister, the hon. Member for South Thanet, came to Kettering and gave a commitment that the Highways Agency would submit proposals to him on the future of the A14 by spring 2007. Those proposals have still not arrived, and I understand that it could be late in 2008 before any hard and fast proposals are advanced. The problem is that local people are suffering. Congestion in Kettering itself is getting worse, and access to the A14 for my constituents who live in Burton Latimer, Rothwell and Desborough is extremely difficult at peak times. The local business community is also suffering. The Northamptonshire chamber of commerce recently commented:â€œBusiness is being lost in the county as a direct result of road congestion and the situation is only going to get worseâ€. Mr. Griffiths, who heads up that chamber, went on to say:â€œThe impacts of congestion are reaching a ridiculous scale, having a direct and significant impact on the bottom line of Northamptonshire companies. Local businesses cannot remain competitive if they lose time, trade and money through rising transport congestion. And, yet we are still to see any concrete solutions or investment plans from government to address it.â€In a comment that I wholeheartedly endorse, he went on to say:â€œTransport issues are not just down to business-think about the impact that the school run makes on peak travel times-indeed, many small businesses are looking to technology, for teleconferencing, remote working, instant messaging, to avoid travelling. But, in a growing county such as ours, the congestion situation will only get worse. We need action on roads, (especially the A14 and A43), we need action on public transport, and we need action on congestion, and fast!â€A very ambitious housing expansion target has been imposed on the county of Northamptonshire, but the road network in the county is not good enough to cope with it. At Government level, the Highways Agency is dragging its feet on proposals to improve the A14, and the Department for Communities and Local Government needs to have a serious discussion with the agency about that. I must tell the Minister that his housing expansion plan in Kettering and north Northamptonshire will simply not be achievable unless there is a sensible solution to sorting out that road, and sorting it out fast. Kettering also needs an eastern bypass before housing expansion goes ahead. There are proposals for up to 5,500 extra houses to be built to the east of Kettering. At the moment, traffic travelling there goes through the villages of Weekley and Warkton. Warkton is a very small village, almost a hamlet, and the road that goes through it is a C-class road-the busiest in the county. If proposals to build up to 5,500 houses to the east of Kettering are adopted, that road will become an absolute nightmare, not just because of the volume of traffic but because of construction traffic. There is an urgent need for an eastern bypass to relieve Weekley and Warkton of that traffic.",47979,"['Written Answers to Questions', 'Communities and Local Government']",Housing,2,3,housing,1779

2007-12-18,Housing [Written Answers to Questions > Communities and Local Government],255,Philip Hollobone,Con,False,"I agree with the hon. Gentleman. In the plans for Northamptonshire, there is a clear commitment to what is called multi-modal shift, which apparently means getting people out of cars and on to public transport. In the proposals for new housing expansion in the county, the county council has an ambitious target of 20 per cent. multi-modal shift. The problem is that, although the Government say they are encouraging such a shift to public transport, they are not funding it. In counties such as Northamptonshire, where infrastructure is cheaper than in some other development areas such as the Thames Gateway, the Government are not rewarding value-for-money schemes. Every pound of extra investment in Northamptonshire would go further in encouraging multi-modal shift than a pound spent in other expansion areas. The penny does not seem to have dropped with the Government that they could achieve a lot more if they looked to areas such as Northamptonshire to deliver the housing expansion that they require. People in the county have picked up on that point. A local developer contacted me ahead of today's debate, stating:â€œThe main point is Government should be investing where it achieves best value for money. I would seek to make it clear to the Minister that North Northamptonshire is pre-eminent in the delivery of housing for the Sustainable Communities plan. Building more houses per annum than Milton Keynes which in turn as the MKSM growth area is a substantially greater housing area than Thames Gateway which receives far more Government interest and funding.â€The local councils in north Northamptonshire are doing their best to ensure that the Government's housing expansion programme works sensibly. They could have taken an alternative view and said, â€œWe are not going to co-operate at all. This is a Government plan, local people don't want it.â€ Local people do not want housing expansion on such a scale, but Her Majesty's Government have placed a statutory duty on Kettering borough council and the other local authorities to make provision for the extra housing, and the local authorities have taken the pragmatic view that they will co-operate with the Government to deliver the plan as best they can and to maximise the involvement of local people in its preparation. That is a pragmatic and sensible way forward, and they are doing their best. Local councils are at the forefront of trying to persuade local people that the plans can work, but they are having their feet pulled from under them by the fact that, time and again, the Government's infrastructure commitments have not been delivered. Another example of that is Kettering's rail service. One might think that if the Government were going to increase the population of the borough by a third by 2021, they would want to improve the rail service to Kettering; in fact, with the franchise changing last month, the new operator, East Midlands Trains-part of the Stagecoach Group-has proposed dramatic cuts to the train service to Kettering from next December. The reason for that, to quote a Government official in the Department for Transport, is that the reduction in Kettering services is a direct result of the introduction of a new service to Corby,â€œdue to limited capacity on the mainlineâ€. Weekday peak evening services from London to Kettering will be cut by a third; Saturday day-tripper services will be cut by 40 per cent., and the number of trains north from Kettering to Sheffield, Derby and Nottingham will be halved. In effect, Stagecoach is saying that it wants to take away Kettering's inter-city status and make the service just outer-suburban. That does not fit with the Minister's plan to build a sustainable community in Kettering. Given the 52,100 extra houses that are to be built in north Northamptonshire by 2021 and the need to create an extra 47,000 jobs to go with those houses, what sort of message do such extensive cuts to the local rail service send to the local business community? It now appears that the Government, through the Department for Transport, have been involved in encouraging the new operator to make cuts, to speed up train services to more distant destinations such as Sheffield, Derby and Nottingham. That is a perfect example of the Government not fulfilling their commitment to local people to provide infrastructure first-before jobs and houses. We cannot have local councils busting a gut to introduce plans to accommodate all the extra housing on one hand, while on the other a major transport provider for the area is seeking to scale back its services to that extent. I strongly encourage the Minister and his colleagues in the Department for Transport to get involved and to ensure that Stagecoach does not proceed with those proposals. Last night, I presented to the House a petition objecting to the proposed cuts in the rail services, which has been signed by 2,485 local Kettering residents. Local roads in the county also need urgent attention, but are not getting the funds they need. Kettering has always been the capital of north Northamptonshire, and the county town is Northampton. One would think that the road between the county town and the county's second town would be one of the major road arteries in the county, but not a bit of it. Instead, the A43 between Kettering and Northampton is the most dangerous and congested road in Northamptonshire. The county council has recently reprioritised that road in its local transport plan, but the regional funding allocations, which are determined by the east midlands region, mean that the pot simply is not big enough for money to be directed to that urgent scheme. The population in the county is set to increase by at least a third, but the main road between the two largest towns in the county cannot attract the funds needed for improvements. It simply is not good enough for the Government to say that such work must be funded by developers. They have to understand that the infrastructure deficit in the county is so big that if the developers have to pay for it all, they will not come to build houses there. As my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point and the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) have commented, roads are not the only issue. We require more than one-off infrastructure investments. There must be a recognition that the populations of counties such as Northamptonshire are increasing anyway, not only as a result of the sustainable communities plan. I refer hon. Members to evidence from Bob Lane, chief executive of the North Northants Development Company, who rightly said:â€œThere is no doubt that official statistics are underestimating the population and this is exacerbating the problem created by the lag that always occurs in growth areas between people arriving and demanding services and the government formula recognising the existence of people in that particular area. This is proving a particular burden obviously to health, education, policing and other revenue based services and from NNDC's point of view could affect housing completions because people may choose not to move to an area where these services are clearly under pressure.â€That message from the highly respected chief executive, Bob Lane, in whom the Government have a lot of confidence, should send alarm bells ringing in the Minister's head. Mr. Lane is absolutely right: the quality of life of people coming to new housing areas in north Northamptonshire, and of the people who live there now, will be adversely affected if the Government do not appreciate the scale of the ongoing revenue commitment required to fund local services. Kettering general hospital is working at breakneck speed to treat an ever-growing local population. It is not only people from Kettering, Corby and Wellingborough who use those services; people from Market Harborough, Leicester and further afield also use them. It is a well respected and hard-working local hospital, but there is only so much that it can do without Government recognition of the pressures that it is under. Local schools are full, and it is difficult to get one's child into the school of one's choice. All the good schools are full, and some of the not-so-good schools will also be full. There seems to be a lag in the provision of new school facilities whenever a new housing proposal comes forward. I know that the local county council has a role to play, but the Government need to recognise that when they allocate funding to local authorities such as Northamptonshire county council. There are not enough police in Northamptonshire, partly because the Government funding formula for local policing is skewing money into the police community support officer programme and taking it out of the programme for police officers with full powers. I know that is not the intention behind the formula, but the effect in Northamptonshire is that although there are more PCSOs, there will be fewer police officers on the streets. I suggest that if the population is to increase by one third, we need one third more police officers, but little assurance is being given to the chief constable and the Northamptonshire police authority that that is the Government's intention.",47979,"['Written Answers to Questions', 'Communities and Local Government']",Housing,2,5,housing,1528

The Government must recognise that if the sustainable communities plan is to work as they intend. They must join up government better, and the Minister and his Department must take the lead, because it is their plan. The Minister must also recognise that much more money will be required; otherwise, the communities that are created will not be sustainable. Communities such as Kettering are crying out for extra social housing-there are 2,700 people on the local council's housing waiting list. I hope that many of the new homes that are built are affordable houses, but the Government cannot have it both ways. They must get out their cheque book to ensure that those communities are sustainable. In conclusion, I hope that the Minister has got the point. I am not making a party political point, but speak on behalf of local residents of all political persuasions, or none, who enjoy living in Kettering. I also make a plea on behalf of all the local councils, which have got together to co-operate with the Government and to ensure that the programme is delivered effectively.

2007-12-18,Housing [Written Answers to Questions > Communities and Local Government],259,Tim Farron,LibDem,False,"It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Martlew. I am sure that we agree on many matters, and we fight with a common spirit as we represent one third of the constituencies in the county of Cumbria. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone), who raised important issues about the infrastructure that is necessary for new housing developments in his constituency and many others. I would like in a brief time to turn the matter on its head. The hon. Gentleman pointed out that the Government's plans for housing development in his part of the world are over-ambitious, or at least the infrastructure that is being provided is insufficiently ambitious to match the plans. I represent Westmorland and Lonsdale, which contains a large chunk of the Lake district and also a significant part of the Yorkshire dales and much other attractive countryside in south Cumbria. What we have there is, perhaps, a lack of ambition when it comes to the provision of new housing, specifically affordable housing. In the next few minutes, I shall encourage the Minister to consider making provision to allow building where infrastructure already exists, in a way that underpins and safeguards that infrastructure. In a nutshell, the problem in south Cumbria is that average house prices are around Â£250,000 and average incomes are some Â£17,000 per year. One does not need to be a mathematician to work out that that means that the average person is stuffed when it comes to getting a mortgage for a home. We also have a problem in that three quarters of our social rented homes-council houses-have been sold off in the past 25 years. The local authority in my area, South Lakeland, is working hard to increase the number of social rented properties, but it is starting from a poor and low position. Some 28 per cent. of our young people leave the area and never return, and the principal reason for that is expensive houses without the commensurate work to enable people to afford them. I and other people have been seeking solutions to the problem. There will not be a one-size-fits-all solution. We have been looking for innovative ways of tackling the problem. One potential scheme that I have come up with and have worked with others on is something that we dub â€œhome on the farmâ€. I am pleased to say that it has received formal backing from the president of the National Farmers Union. I estimate that in my constituency several hundred affordable, social rented properties could be created in buildings that already exist-that is, underused or disused farm buildings. The buildings already exist, as does the infrastructure to underpin them. Typically, on many farm sites there may be a disused or underused farm building in which one could create two or three affordable, social rented cottages. Two of them might be put into the general social housing pot for the district, and the third would be an agricultural tied cottage. In my constituency and many others, a principal problem with the sustainability of farming, particularly in the uplands, is anybody being in a position to take on the tenancy or ownership of a farm once the farming couple reach retirement age. It would be wonderful if one could provide a social rented agricultural tied cottage on site. Typically, it would be a place for the daughter and son-in-law, or son and daughter-in-law, of the farmer to live in, and then the couples would swap when the older couple reached retirement age. As I said, the other two houses would be put in the social rented pot to try to alleviate the pressure on the local housing market. Such a scheme would help to underpin and make use of the existing infrastructure of local farming, help to ensure sustainability in a vital industry in our area, and maintain the countryside that other Members' constituents love to visit. It would also be important in trying to keep young people, families and people of all ages in rural areas. In relation to underpinning infrastructure, I think of a village that I represent. The school in Satterthwaite, which is near Hawkshead, closed last year. Ironically, it is about to be converted into affordable housing. If there had been affordable housing in the village five years ago, the school would not have shut. If we can create living, vibrant communities in places such as those that I represent, we will be able to safeguard our schools, post offices, public transport routes and so on, prevent young people from leaving and create balanced communities. I simply ask for a reclassification of existing buildings to brownfield sites to allow development for the exclusive, narrow purpose of providing affordable rented accommodation. Guidance should be given not just to local authorities and district councils but to national parks, which also hold the reins on planning in areas such as those that I represent. One of our great problems, understandably, is dealing with people who say, â€œNot in my backyard.â€ The wonderful thing about this scheme is that it calls for development in the backyards of people who desperately want it.",47979,"['Written Answers to Questions', 'Communities and Local Government']",Housing,2,9,housing,863
2007-12-18,Housing [Written Answers to Questions > Communities and Local Government],260,Peter Luff,Con,False,"I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on the way in which he introduced this important debate, and on the passionate plea that he made for his constituents. Similarly, the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) made a passionate plea for his constituents and helpfully demonstrated how different the questions of house building and infrastructure are in different parts of the country. In the time remaining, I would like to make a similar plea on behalf of my constituents in Worcestershire, which I believe also has broader national policy implications. I was interested particularly in my hon. Friend's final remarks about the broader quality of life issues that are at stake. When people hear the word â€œinfrastructureâ€, they often think just about roads, and possibly railways, but infrastructure is actually so much more than that, as he rightly said in the concluding part of his speech. Three aspects of infrastructure most worry me when considering the prospects that face my constituents as a result of significant increases in housing. Rail networks are the element of public transport that can play a real part in relieving some of the pressures in my county. If we had decent co-ordination between cars and rail, decent car parks at railway stations and, by the way, a decent rail line to London-that is another matter-we could see a big shift to public transport. The problem too often is that one cannot leave one's car at a railway station. The hospital service in my constituency is at breaking point. I now fully admit that I was wrong to support the construction of the Worcester Royal infirmary at its current size-it is too small to serve the existing population of the county. An additional significant population coming from whatever process-I shall come to one specific issue later-will stretch that hospital beyond its capacity to serve my constituents. Another issue that is crucial but does not get much attention is how we deal with refuse and waste. That system, too, is under huge pressure and strain in my constituency, and additional house building will put it in a serious situation. Of course, roads, public transport and bus services are important. Schools are also important, but as there is some decline in Worcestershire school populations at present, schools may be able to cope with the increased development. Getting energy to the new houses is important, as are water and sewerage, and, as my hon. Friend rightly said, the emergency services. Leisure services and open spaces are part of a community's infrastructure, too. We must not lose our open spaces by cramming houses into existing urban areas. I particularly draw attention to flood defences and flood protection work, which are part of the infrastructure in my constituency, and which new house building in the wrong location threatens. The problem is that we are trying to work out what we need to do while steering a course between the Scylla and Charybdis of two different and conflicting parts of Government planning policy. Perhaps I should call them, in the spirit of the season-a happy Christmas to you, Mr. Martlew-the ugly sisters of planning policy: the regional spatial strategy revision and the joint core strategy. I congratulate the Worcester News, my local paper, on its attempt to make those two arcane subjects comprehensible to the people who live in south Worcestershire. They are difficult subjects, and people find it difficult to wrestle with them, but they have huge implications for house building and infrastructure in my constituency and also in Worcester city and Malvern Hills. The problem is that the timetable for the joint core strategy, which is how the local districts decide how they will provide housing and the infrastructure to support it, is out of sync with that of the regional spatial strategy revision. The RSSR second-phase numbers have been agreed. They are high-higher than I would like-but we can probably just about cope with them. The problem is that Worcester city is full and my constituents have to take a large proportion of the houses that are actually Worcester city houses. My concern is that the Government, when it comes to the examination in public, will actually increase the numbers. At present, the joint core strategy is being consulted on locally and effectively by the three district councils. They have come together in a joint strategy, which is really good and helps to get a picture across south Worcestershire, but they do not know the final housing numbers for which they will have to cater. The questions are being asked the wrong way round. The joint core strategy should be decided a year later when we know what the housing situation is. However, it is even worse than that. Phase 3 of the regional spatial strategy has only just begun. It looks at some important issues for my constituents: rural services; Gypsy and Traveller sites; culture; environment, including flood risk, air quality, renewable energy and green belt; and minerals. We are conducting our joint core strategy before we even know what the regional assembly will say about those things, never mind what the Government will agree to. It seems a bizarre way in which to run something. I entirely agree that we need more houses in south Worcestershire. I am not someone who says that we cannot build them. Clearly, the existing population is ageing, household formation rates are increasing and we need some more new houses. However, I have doubts about the levels. I think that the Government have over-predicted on immigration. They have taken three years of very high immigration levels and projected them into the future. They should have projected the last 20 years, and then we would have seen a lower demand for new house building, but that is a separate debate. I agree, though, that we need more houses and more affordable houses, which my hon. Friend mentioned in his speech. There is a serious problem with affordable housing in my constituency. I am not one who says that we should not have houses, but I think that we are probably being asked to provide too many at present, and the Government risk asking us to provide many more. We must ensure that a good number of those houses are genuinely affordable and not built by developers to meet a market need that they perceive for themselves, rather than the market failure that affordable housing should address. If we do not know how many houses the Government are going to ask us to build in Worcestershire, I do not see how can we plan or fund the infrastructure in an intelligent way. Here, I bring in the pantomime villain of the piece to go with my earlier metaphor of the ugly sisters. On top of the regional spatial strategy plan numbers and the uncertainty of the south Worcestershire joint core strategy, the Government are considering plans to build two eco-towns in my constituency. One is entirely in my constituency, on the old RAF airfield at Throckmorton, and the other is two thirds in Warwickshire, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples), and one third in my constituency. The trouble is that we know nothing about what those plans involve. We can only guess how many houses are being proposed by the developers. We do not know the criteria that the Government will use to assess whether those towns should go ahead. We know and understand that they will have their own local infrastructure, but they will also put huge demands on the wider infrastructure of south Worcestershire, particularly on the things that worry me-the railways, the hospitals, the waste disposal systems and the rest. I am worried that the Government are saying that those eco-towns will be in addition to regional spatial strategy plan numbers. They may be playing a very clever game. Although we have the West Midlands regional assembly's preferred numbers, I bet that the Government will up those numbers miraculously next year to meet whatever number of eco-town houses they are trying to impose on my constituency. Technically, the numbers will be within the regional spatial strategy plan, but the Government will have been shuttling around and doing some very clever arithmetic to justify their numbers. Initially, when the eco-towns were proposed, my constituents did not seem too concerned-after all, everything that is eco is good. If the word â€œecoâ€ is put in front of anything, it makes it acceptable. One councillor spoke to me about the Government's proposal for the eco-town at Throckmorton, where the Government have previously tried to build an asylum seekers centre, which was rejected, and where they have dumped large numbers of diseased cattle-they probably were not diseased-from the foot and mouth epidemic. I do not know what the Government have got in for Throckmorton, but there we are; never mind. The ambition was to ensure that half of the houses were affordable, which sounds great. We would have an eco-town with affordable houses. One could not possibly oppose such a magnificent combination. It would be like being against apple pie or against Christmas. However, if that town is to be a genuine eco-town, to be sustainable, and not to put a burden on the wider infrastructure of south Worcestershire, and if half the houses are to be affordable, half the jobs provided locally must be affordable, too. I do not think that planners can get right that magic equation in which all the people who live in the new Throckmorton super eco-town will also work in the same town. No, they will get in their cars and drive, putting a huge strain on the infrastructure and damaging the environment. We do not know what criteria the Government are using to assess the eco-towns. We do not know how big they are going to be. We know nothing about them. Freedom of information requests have failed and parliamentary questions have produced very little. Three district councils are trying to plan their joint core strategy and their infrastructure, without knowing what the regional spatial strategy numbers will be or how many eco- towns they will have imposed on them. It is absolutely ludicrous. The district councils should not commit to the location of any of the housing that they need to find under the regional spatial strategy plan until they know what those eco-towns are and how the infrastructure is going to be funded and planned. I am not saying that the Government necessarily have to find all the money for the infrastructure. The Milton Keynes model-the roof tax for providing private sector developer money for infrastructure-is a good one. I am not saying that we necessarily need to use public money. But we must know the precise mechanisms that will be in place to deliver the money that we need to fund the infrastructure for these new houses. If we get that wrong, not just the people in the new houses, but the people in the houses that are already there will suffer. Their quality of life is at stake, too. Getting to London from my constituency is already a nightmare. The roads are at breaking point and the railway cannot cope. Fifteen years ago, that journey was an acceptable part of my life; now it is one of the most unpleasant features of it. Putting in massive new numbers of houses on that infrastructure will compound the problem and make existing residents' lives miserable, as well as failing to provide a proper quality of life for the people who will live in those new houses. It is this failure to understand the impact on current residents that I want to drive home. I say to the Government, please be more open with us now about the eco-towns and tell us how big they will be. Will they have 5,000 houses or 20,000? That is the range of possible numbers. Please tell us what assessment will be made of the impact of the infrastructure on the area and on other towns around it. If a new eco-town is built at Throckmorton, what impact will it have on the very attractive Georgian market town of Pershore, which is only a couple of miles away? How can the Government decide that it is right to go ahead with that eco-town when they do not understand the dynamic of south Worcestershire and the possible impact on the town of Pershore, which lies outside my constituency in that of my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire (Sir Michael Spicer)? Therefore, big questions about those eco-towns must be resolved. I also ask the Government to tell us in precise detail how the infrastructure that we need is going to be funded. If we do not have that detail, we cannot plan with any confidence. One of our key jobs as constituency MPs-my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering and the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale did this very well in their opening remarks-is to defend the interests of our constituents. The Government are tying our hands behind our backs as we seek to do that. I hope that the Minister will shed some light on the issue.",47979,"['Written Answers to Questions', 'Communities and Local Government']",Housing,2,10,housing,2210
2007-12-18,Housing [Written Answers to Questions > Communities and Local Government],261,Paul Holmes,LibDem,False,"I congratulate the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing this debate. He has given us a very detailed exposition and analysis of the problems facing a growth area such as Kettering. It is an area that he knows far better than I do, so I will not try to go back over the detail of that local case, which has been more than eloquently laid before us. The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) and the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) gave different examples, but all made the same point. Many of the problems outlined in the opening speech are common across huge parts of the country and are seen not only in the specific high growth areas designated by the Government. A number of common themes have emerged from the speeches of the hon. Members who have contributed so far. One such theme centres around the question of housing growth. From the Government's point of view, that growth is concentrated in a number of handpicked high-growth areas in which the sheer volume of housing that is to be provided will cause enormous problems and strains on the surrounding infrastructure. The issue of jobs was also raised. If sustainable communities are to be created, jobs need to be created in the locality of the housing. This country has a generally inadequate road system, and public transport is very inadequate compared with that in most of our continental counterparts. In some growth areas, there will be tens of thousands of new houses-for example, 160,000 in the Thames Gateway-and we cannot have such large conglomerations without public transport and road transport infrastructure, particularly if people must commute long distances to find work elsewhere. If growth areas are in the London satellite areas, it will be impossible, given the state of the infrastructure, for residents to commute to London. Even if the infrastructure could be improved to cope with that amount of commuting, would one want that? How would that fit with our commitments on tackling climate change, for example? If we are to have truly sustainable communities, we must look not just at an area's transport infrastructure-roads and public transport-but at the development of local employment in tandem with growth areas. Hon. Members have touched on other areas of infrastructure and given local examples, such as the provision of schools, hospitals, shops, community facilities, water, sewerage and so on. The hon. Member for Castle Point spoke about schools and asked what would happen in areas where schools had been closed, or were bursting at the seams-one example was in Kettering-because tens of thousands of new houses had been built. Does one wait until the problem has developed and then provide the schools, or does one plan ahead, which creates funding issues? Only two weeks ago, some of us were debating a similar issue concerning Aylesbury Vale, another housing growth area, which is south of Milton Keynes, and the same issues arose. A specific issue in Aylesbury Vale is pertinent to some of the points that hon. Members have made about water, sewerage and power supplies. In one area the proposal was for 4,000 to 6,000 new houses, but the electricity company said that there was no capacity for delivering electricity to the area without building a new sub-station, which would cost Â£6 million up front. The electricity company could not provide that money up front and said that someone else would have to raise it. Who will provide Â£6 million up front to supply the electricity infrastructure to allow those 4,000 to 6,000 houses to be built? One cannot have one without the other, but where will the up-front money come from? There are other examples, and I shall return to one when I look at possible solutions. North of Chesterfield, the Brimington and Staveley area runs up to the M1, where a large development is under way to create a new motorway junction-29A-and a large industrial park on an old colliery site. Over the next five, 10 or 15 years, it will become a major employment area for a deprived coalfield community stretching from Chesterfield to Bolsover. The Government may create a motorway junction and the huge industrial park on the reclaimed colliery site will create jobs. However, it will also generate a huge amount of traffic-and not just extra traffic on the M1, for which lane-widening is already being considered because it is so congested, but extra transport on the existing road infrastructure through Staveley and Brimington to Chesterfield, and the other way from Chesterfield through Brimington and Staveley up to the huge new industrial park that will be created. The Brimington and Staveley area has been promised a bypass since 1936, but the money has never been available, although it was promised repeatedly, usually around the time of county council elections. The bypass never happened, because the money was not available. The county council and the Government say that even to think about the bypass is not on the books, but when the industrial park near junction 29A is up and running in five, 10 or 15 years with the additional employment and the additional transport problems on the road through Brimington and Staveley, which is already too congested, they will think again about a bypass. We shall create the problem and then think about a solution. That is the wrong way round, as we have heard with the other examples of schools, sewerage, electricity supply and so on. Those are common problems. The hon. Member for Kettering said that the East Midlands Development Agency should put more money into major road infrastructure in the Kettering and Northampton area, but Chesterfield is in the far north of the east midlands region and we want some of that money for road infrastructure in our area-for example, for the Brimington and Staveley bypass. The danger is that we will rob Peter to pay Paul, unless infrastructure is planned systematically. Those problems are common throughout the country. What are the solutions? Hon. Members have suggested that some of the major growth areas, which the Government have handpicked in willing partnership with local councils, are too large. Should we be looking at spreading them out? In my area, Derby is a growth area. It is a small city and has been selected by the Government for considerable growth, but some people in Derby are asking whether they want that with the accompanying infrastructure problems and huge population growth. On the other hand, Chesterfield, which is not far from Derby-about 20 miles further north-has been restricted to 280 new houses a year, but we want further expansion. We are recovering from the massive unemployment that followed pit closures and then the loss of engineering works, and we need more housing than we have been allowed. My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale spoke about homes on farms for people in lower income brackets who cannot afford to buy in the normal way in a popular tourist area such as the Lake district. The problem is the same in Cornwall, and similar in Derbyshire. Some of the new homes in growth areas such as Derby are for people who will commute from the suburbs to low-paid jobs in the Derbyshire Peak district. They cannot afford to live in the Peak district because the houses are either in the upmarket commuter belt or are second homes. It would be more sensible to look at planning issues throughout the country rather than focusing on huge growth areas because we would minimise some of the problems. Another issue concerning solutions is infrastructure funding. The pre-Budget report referred to Â£1.7 billion of targeted funding, which is a step in the right direction, but only for growth areas. The Milton Keynes levy from 2005 has been held up as a great example throughout the country of how to raise money for infrastructure. The community infrastructure levy in the Planning Bill, which has just started its progress through Parliament, is another step in that direction. Many people would say that it is based on the Milton Keynes roof tax idea. The Bill, which has only just been presented to Parliament, contains 10 sketchy clauses with almost no detail of how it will work, but it will be some time before it is implemented. The community infrastructure levy will not completely solve the funding gap. In Aylesbury, Â£6 million was required up front to provide the electricity capacity for new homes. In Ashford, the Highways Agency vetoed the building of new houses because of the pressure that they would cause on the M20. Taylor Woodrow said that it would put up Â£7 million to improve capacity on the motorway and that Ashford council could repay it over a number of years as it received levies from developers. We need more up-front funding, and cannot rely totally on piecemeal funding from this or that company. Otherwise, many such developments will be stymied. The Government and regional agencies must consider providing up-front funding. We need less Government diktat, particularly in large growth areas, and more joined-up planning and more thought about up-front funding for infrastructure before houses are built, not after problems have been created.",47979,"['Written Answers to Questions', 'Communities and Local Government']",Housing,2,11,housing,1548
2007-12-18,Housing [Written Answers to Questions > Communities and Local Government],262,Bob Neill,Con,False,"It is a pleasure, Mr. Martlew, to see you in the Chair. I join other hon. Members in wishing you and everyone else the compliments of the season on our last sitting day. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing this debate on an important issue. He has been assiduous in raising his constituents' concerns about this and related topics throughout his time in the House. I pay tribute to his work in that regard, and I am delighted that he has given us the opportunity to debate the matter today. The debate has been worth while and constructive, and I am grateful for the contributions from other hon. Members. It is interesting that the common thread running through the observations is the need to provide infrastructure if there is to be a sustainable supply of good-quality housing. Those elements must all be equally stressed, which is why the sequential approach taken by the borough council leader in my hon. Friend's area is so important. A real concern for many of us, however, is that that approach does not appear to have been taken in practice, and we look to the Minister today to deal with that. If we do not provide transport infrastructure or, as other hon. Members have said, the social, education and health infrastructure to go with it, existing communities will inevitably resist new development and we will be in danger, as many professionals have observed, of creating the sink estates of the future. Such problems are apparent to me as a London Member of Parliament, although London has not yet been mentioned. My constituency borders the Thames Gateway, and I know that the Minister takes an interest in the project, but I am sorry to say that, so many years on, the Government's handling of it remains disjointed. Such condemnation is all too typical of much regeneration and growth policy, and the Thames Gateway project has been described-rightly, I fear-as an alphabet soup of disparate agencies, none of which are pulling together. In that respect, it was useful to hear the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), who represents part of the gateway. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron), who made a number of important points. Among other things, he stressed, as Conservative Members always have, that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution-there needs to be much more flexibility. If there is a criticism to be made of the Government, it is that their top-down, centralised, target-driven approach is too one size fits all to meet current needs, and I hope that the Minister will address that. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) dealt with the important impact of development on the quality of life of current residents. As I hope that I have suggested, it is important that we deal with that if we are to get existing communities to buy in to development. That links to the need for openness-not only in terms of eco-towns, but generally-and for precision about funding, which is a key point. In London, that has been an issue in relation to the long-running Crossrail saga. In my constituency, people are still waiting for the delivery of the Thameslink rail link, which is a key piece of infrastructure. Thameslink 2000 is now likely to arrive in about 2016, which is a pretty significant delay, even by the standards of South Eastern Trains. That lack of precision and clarity causes many people to believe that the projects will not be delivered and that we will create rather soulless dormitories with inadequate links. In that context, the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) made a hugely important point about the need for local employment, but the issue has perhaps not been sufficiently addressed. I have great regard for the Minister on a personal level, but the Government have so far failed to tackle the issues before us. The Housing and Regeneration Bill gives us no confidence that Ministers have learned the necessary lessons, because it, too, is predicated on a centralised, target-driven strategy. It simply is not adequate to pile target upon target or, as the Bill does, quango upon quango; that is not the way to get communities to buy into the projects that we need. I do not doubt the Government's good intentions, but Ministers must unfortunately face the fact that their performance does not match their good intentions. They are building fewer homes, including social homes, than the previous Conservative Administration; their targets are not delivering on the ground, and that is the key issue. The Planning Bill, which proposes a community infrastructure levy, falls into the same trap. As the hon. Member for Chesterfield said, it is sensible to look at the means by which local communities can harness the added value of development, but the CIL, as currently proposed, seems extremely remote and potentially bureaucratic. It is administered at a rather distant, regional level and breaks the key link between the local community, where the development takes place, and that community's ability to have a say over where funds will go and what projects it will finance and support locally. If local people are to buy into development, such decisions must be taken much closer to them, rather than at regional level. In the spirit of Christmas, I am prepared to offer the Minister one or two potential goodies, and perhaps he will want to steal them from our bag. I hope that the Government will look more favourably at giving communities incentives to recognise that it is in their enlightened self-interest to welcome development. That requires them to be certain, as my hon. Friends said, that infrastructure will be properly funded and delivered. That requires the Government to be open about the fact that confidence in their official population statistics has collapsed in many parts of the country. In growth areas in much of the south-east, local authorities of all parties have raised concerns about the fact that current statistics do not adequately reflect population growth and, therefore, that funding formulae do not adequately reflect the real population on the ground. That creates pressure on existing populations and makes them even more resistant to new development, which could, if properly funded, be of great benefit. The Treasury's unwillingness to move away from Office for National Statistics formulae, which are now largely discredited at all levels, is, with respect, a serious mistake, and I hope that the Minister will look at the issue again. I also hope that the Minister will look at some of the proposals that we have had from others with experience in this field, including Lord Heseltine, who had a pretty good track record on regeneration, if I may say so. He has suggested that we look at the possibility of councils keeping the additional revenue from council tax and business rate growth, perhaps for five years or so, to give them an incentive to welcome growth. When I was a local councillor in the 1970s, it was useful for us to encourage commercial development in our area because we kept the additional revenues from business rate growth. I hope that the Government will seriously consider moving back in that direction.",47979,"['Written Answers to Questions', 'Communities and Local Government']",Housing,2,12,housing,1220

We must start from a position that commands the confidence of the business community and see how things develop. That is why it is worth the Government examining the details of the formulation that I suggested, and I hope that the Opposition, too, would look at the issue constructively. On an issue that concerns rural and other areas, we should consider the greater use of community land trusts. That would allow us to build local homes and ensure that homes remained available to local people. That important need must be met. I also hope that the Government will look more constructively at allowing local communities to introduce new social enterprise zones to promote social enterprise, particularly in disadvantaged communities. That is not the whole answer to the question of how to encourage local employment, but it is an important part of it. There are therefore many positive things that could be done locally, but I regret to say that the current top-down, target-driven approach does not address them. I hope, however, that the Minister will give us some Christmas cheer by saying that he will look at the issues that we have raised and move away from the Government's needlessly rigid approach, which his heart is perhaps not really in.",47979,"['Written Answers to Questions', 'Communities and Local Government']",Housing,2,14,housing,253

I congratulate the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing this important debate, which has been conducted in a well mannered and well intentioned way. It has been incredibly useful, certainly for me, to tease out some of the arguments about housing and the necessary links with infrastructure. I shall several times stress in my speech that it is very important that housing and infrastructure should be integral; they need to be together, in parallel, to unlock the growth that is needed and to provide the sustainable communities that we require. To return to first principles, we need more homes. That is becoming a political consensus now, across the spectrum. We have not been building enough homes since about the 1970s. Housing supply has not kept pace with demand. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) referred to that most articulately. Society is changing. We are living longer and in different ways, including on our own. That needs to be addressed through the housing stock in a way that perhaps was not recognised 30 or 40 years ago. We are not coming from a complete standing start. Housing growth numbers have increased, for new build, by about 40 per cent. since 2001, to about 185,000 new builds a year, but we need to go further. The projections are that 223,000 households are forming every year, so we need to build more to accommodate them.

Member for Chesterfield and I are both on the Committee considering the Housing and Regeneration Bill, and are looking at the issue to ensure that we are addressing the needs in question. I am very fortunate, as I expect are other hon. Members, in that I am a home owner. I was brought up to think that it was possible for me to own my home. I should hate it if in the next 10 to 15 years pressures on affordability were to lead to a situation in which housing was a source of inequality, home ownership was not the preserve of everyone, and good-quality housing was for an elite.

2007-12-18,Housing [Written Answers to Questions > Communities and Local Government],269,Iain Wright,Lab,False,"Hon. Gentlemen are making my points for me. We have not consistently been building enough houses for a generation. We need to deal with that, and the Government are putting in place the building blocks-literally-to do so to meet the housing needs of all society, rather than just a narrow elite, now and in the future. It is not, however, only a matter of bricks and mortar. We took evidence in Housing and Regeneration Bill sittings last week, and I made the point, when I gave evidence, that although there is a target for 3 million homes to be built by 2020, it will not work if we simply plonk them in a field. We need the infrastructure to be in place. Modern development should consist of well designed homes in attractive environments, made sustainable by the right infrastructure, which, as hon. Members have mentioned, encompasses transport, utilities, green space, policing and flood defence. Good design is also very relevant. I do not want quality to be compromised in any way because of the expansion of house-building targets. We need good- quality, well planned homes that meet the needs of the population and are in well designed areas where people want to live. My big fear is that in 20 years we shall have built homes that people do not want to live in, and will be putting more public money into them. They will not be sustainable and we shall have to think of regeneration areas for homes built between 2010 to 2015. That will not be good enough. The people of this country deserve better, and we have a lot to do. I want to stress in the strongest terms that the Government are committed to ensuring that housing growth is closely accompanied by the infrastructure necessary to provide sustainable development at local level. Perhaps I may quote a passage from the 2007 pre-Budget report about increased spending on infrastructure:â€œIt is essential that new housing developments are accompanied by the investment in schools, transport and other infrastructure needed to support flourishing and prosperous communities. The 2007 CSR has therefore been informed by a review into the investment needed to support the Government's housing ambitions... To support this strategy over the next three years the Government is providing Â£1.7 billion of targeted funding for infrastructure in Growth Areas, the Thames Gateway, New Growth Points and eco-towns, including Â£300 million to continue the Community Infrastructure Fund over the CSR.â€It is essential that we should continue to do that. I am getting to know the Milton Keynes and south midlands area very well, because I chair the MKSM inter-regional board. I am starting to love the area, and I am very impressed by the people. The inter-regional board is considering many issues associated with prioritising and co-ordinating the investment necessary to support housing growth in the sub-region. I was pleased to attend my first board meeting in Bedford earlier in the year, and I spoke at the second annual conference in Kettering, and greatly enjoyed it. However, I did not experience, on the ground in Kettering and elsewhere, the somewhat pessimistic tone adopted by the hon. Member for Kettering. I recently received a letter from Michael Hayes, the chief executive of the West Northamptonshire development corporation; I hope that he will not mind my quoting the letter, in which he says:â€œYour vision of an enterprising sub-region at the heart of the UK particularly echoed our thoughts. We agree that with our location, connectivity and potential skills base, our area can not only provide sustainable communities of the future, but be a principal economic driver for the wider nation.â€He continued:â€œThe conference was also a valuable opportunity to recognise the progress that has already been made. Since 2005, WNDC has been setting the foundations for an unprecedented period of growth and regeneration, helping to invest almost Â£30 m in local infrastructure projects, assuming planning control powers for strategic developments and subsequently attracting considerable amounts of private sector investment into the area.â€I see the area as a real can-do area, full of positivity and ambition. There are challenges, but a real opportunity for growth and opportunity has been seen, which can really drive the UK economy. I want to do all I can to facilitate and enable it. The hon. Member for Kettering mentioned a couple of points about transport, and perhaps I may respond to them, as I know that he has a particular interest in that subject. As to what he said about the A14, I understand that the Highways Agency is looking into measures that would allow the new housing to be got under way while the current A14 could remain functional. That would include the prospect of something called ramp metering-a technique by which the amount of traffic joining the A14 would be managed by the use of signals, accompanied by sensors, to regulate the system and prevent the build-up of traffic on the adjacent local road network. I wrote to the hon. Gentleman recently in response to a parliamentary question and explained thatâ€œNorth Northamptonshire Joint Planning Unit has been developing a Core Strategy which is currently at the Examination in Public stageâ€. I added:â€œThe Highways Agency has presented information to the Examination in Public to show improvements that can be made to the A14 to meet the anticipated housing trajectory.â€- I understand that the Highways Agency intends to submit a report to Ministers in the spring, outlining potential interim and long-term solutions, and I await it with interest. There is an awful lot more that I could discuss, but time will not allow it. I shall briefly refer to East Midlands Trains. It is for the company, working with Network Rail, to determine the exact timetable. I know that local stakeholders have been putting their views on detailed timetabling issues to the train operator in recent weeks. The hon. Gentleman mentioned a petition that he presented to the House yesterday, which I imagine will be a powerful driver in pushing the issue forward. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Transport, visited Kettering recently and is taking a keen personal interest in transport issues, in the town and in north Northamptonshire. I want to mention that my right hon. Friend's father passed away yesterday; I know that the whole House would want to convey its sympathy to her. As I said, housing and infrastructure are absolutely crucial.

2008-11-12,Housing,527,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"Although it is a pleasure to have an Adjournment debate, it is not a pleasure to talk about problems such as those that we are going to talk about this morning. I support the Government's targets on building 3 million new homes by 2020, but we must try to do something to address the great shortage of houses for social renting, which is all too obvious to any hon. Member who listens, in their surgery, to the tales of woe and despair that are told all too regularly by people desperate for accommodation when there are no houses to rent. Looking at the current situation gives no one any pleasure at all; prices and sales are falling and the number of new homes being built is falling as well. Because I appreciate that other hon. Members want to speak I shall try to concentrate on three issues: the state of buying and selling in the housing market and what it may be possible to do-if anything-to help that situation; how we can better help people to keep the homes that they have; and what we might be able to do to stimulate the production of more homes for rent. First, the situation in the housing market is pretty much one of doom and despair. Prices have fallen by 15 per cent. over the past year. Although there are slight variations and different estimates, that is a reasonably accurate average of the various figures produced by different organisations. It is not necessarily enormously bad in terms of the correction in prices over time, although there are some problems for people in negative equity. These things are still limited, but the market is pretty dead. With regard to estate agents, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors figures show that there is about one sale per month. The knock-on consequence on the new build industry is clear, and there is talk of perhaps only 100,000 new homes being built next year, which is a long way short of the figure required. The average growth of households is some 240,000 a year, so there is an awful, big gap that will create problems in the longer term. In addition, mortgage funding this year is at about 40 per cent. of what it was last year. Everyone can see that there is no quick fix to the problems with buying and selling homes. It will, perhaps, be some time before the market stabilises, and until it does, it is likely that buyers will hold on to see whether prices stop falling. Sellers will probably have to be more realistic about the prices that they ask for. There is clearly a problem in respect of mortgages for first-time buyers, which is holding up many buying-and-selling chains, because people are now being asked to find 25 per cent. deposits, rather than 10 per cent. deposits. Until prices have fallen a bit further and lenders can be sure that properties will not get into serious negative equity, we will not see a return to 90 per cent. mortgages at least. People having to find a 10 per cent. deposit is much more realistic. I hope that there will be no return to lending above-value amounts on houses. There are many initiatives, including the first-time home buyers' initiative, MyChoice Home Buy and Home Buy Direct, and there is a lot of confusion about precisely what people can access and how. There is an issue about people getting comprehensive advice on the market. Will Ministers look at the shared ownership models that are around and look at how easy, or how difficult, it is for people to access them? Shared ownership is an option for people who cannot get anything more than a 75 per cent. mortgage and who do not have the deposit. There is a lot of evidence that mortgage lenders are not recognising that the Government are effectively underwriting part of the buying process in respect of shared ownership and are still asking for too much money from people trying to go down the shared ownership route. I have to mention one really bad case, which I have passed to officials in the Department for Communities and Local Government for their consideration, and I hope that Ministers will look at it. One of my constituents, Margaret Wilson, came to me with the story of her daughter, who has been trying since July to go down the shared ownership purchase route. It all started okay; she was told that she was eligible for the scheme, so she found a property and arranged a mortgage, but she was then told that the money had run out at Government level. She started again and found another property and was told a second time that the money had run out. Having complained about the arrangements, she was finally told by officials that a little bit of money was left and that, if she proceeded quickly, perhaps the sale could proceed; however, she was also told that she would have to find a little bit more money from the mortgage company than she had initially thought necessary. So she went back to the mortgage company, which then decided to send the matter to its underwriters, because Â£4,000 extra was required on the mortgage. The underwriters said, â€œWe're sorry, but we can't approve this extra Â£4,000.â€ She renegotiated a new price with the sellers of the home, in a falling market, got a reduction and returned to the building society, which said, â€œWe're very sorry, but that mortgage product is now off the market and no mortgage is available.â€ She had been trying for four months, having previously been accepted as eligible for a shared ownership purchase, and she is back to square one, with no mortgage and no house to buy. Those sorts of complication need to be addressed if shared ownership is going to be a reality.",50153,[],Housing,0,1,housing,985

However, he will be aware, as all hon. Members are, that some of our constituents who joined schemes that released small amounts of equity-perhaps Â£30,000 or Â£40,000-to them 10 years ago are now having to pay back Â£120,000, Â£160,000 or Â£180,000 to major banks; these are not scams.

2008-11-12,Housing,529,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"That is a fair point. The regulation needs to be looked at in respect of some of these schemes, particularly equity release schemes. Ministers also need to look at the benefits complications of people in shared ownership: dealing with the rental element and the element of purchase can get complicated when getting into pension credits and housing benefits, for example. That is something else that we need to review to try to ease people down the shared ownership path. Ministers have taken action in terms of the abolition of stamp duty on less expensive homes. I am sceptical about whether that will really kick-start the market, whether that is a beneficial expenditure of money and even whether the Â£600 million that has been allocated will be spent. If it is not, will Ministers consider transferring it into something more real, such as building new homes for rent?",50153,[],Housing,0,3,housing,147
2008-11-12,Housing,530,Julia Goldsworthy,LibDem,False,"Specifically on stamp duty, does the hon.

2008-11-12,Housing,531,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"Almost inevitably, people may wait to see what happens when there is any talk about a possible change of policy. That is not particularly a medium or long-term problem. I am just not sure whether the stamp duty holiday has any significant effect, particularly in this depressed market. The money might be better spent on something else. Although the package of measures to help with building more homes and buying up empty homes was welcome-I will talk about that a bit more in a minute-it came at the expense of taking some money off future budgets for regional development agencies. However, that money will need to be spent helping small businesses in future, so Ministers ought to revise that issue, too. There is a dilemma. I am not sure whether there is any easy solution to kick-starting the buying and selling of homes. We ought certainly to consider giving people advice about the various alternative home-buying schemes and should try to look at shared ownership. We should also recognise that some people are expressing grave concerns that, when the market bottoms out and starts to recover and demand comes back, after two or three years of low house building, we could see a sharp upward spike in house prices and a return to the old problems that we have had. That is a real issue, and the Government must think about it. They must also think about a problem in two or three years' time. If the industry will be laying people off and not training them, how can it recover to meet the extra demand that will come at some stage in two or three years?",50153,[],Housing,0,5,housing,277
2008-11-12,Housing,532,Bob Spink,UKIP,False,"The hon. Gentleman is talking about homes not being sold. One class of homes that people in my constituency are having difficulty selling is flats where houses have been knocked down and 30 or 40 flats have been built on the site. In some of those blocks, such as those in Long road, Canvey Island, the flats cannot be sold. Does he think the Government should consider how to bring such units into social housing schemes, so that members of the public can buy them? That would help the market and people who need social housing.",50153,[],Housing,0,6,housing,96
2008-11-12,Housing,533,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"Yes, I agree, and I shall come to that when I make my third point. There are no quick fixes for the housing market, but there are some big and different problems in the medium and longer term. My second point is about keeping people in their homes. The Government propose that, from next April, people who are out of work-unfortunately, there will be many more of them in the next few months-will become eligible to have their mortgage payments included in any income support arrangements after three months instead of nine months of unemployment. That is very welcome, and it should help to deal with the flood of repossessions that might otherwise arise. Another issue is giving better advice and signalling where people can go for advice when they get into difficulties. Clearly, the message must be that they should talk to their lenders and that lenders should consider every solution short of repossession-for example, extending the mortgage period and interest-only mortgages or percentage-of-interest-only mortgages for a short period-to help people through the crisis. Lots of advice is available, particularly from citizens advice bureaux, and from other organisations and advice centres. Local authorities should co-ordinate that and have an access line that people can ring to ask where to obtain advice in these difficult circumstances. The Government could encourage that. I hope that the Government will take urgent steps to reverse last week's court decision that lenders may secure eviction of home owners after two missed payments without going to court. That judgment is worrying. I am sure that many lenders will not take that route and be responsible and try to work with people to keep them in their homes, going to the courts for a possession order only as a last resort. Last week's decision that people may bypass the courts-there are unscrupulous lenders around who, unfortunately, often lend to the poorest and most vulnerable people-must be reversed to give people greater security. The Government's scheme for keeping people in their homes allows mortgages to be transferred to shared ownership-people may not welcome that immediately, but it would be better than losing their home-and tries to ensure that such arrangements are simple and easy to understand. My third point concerns social housing. Clearly, a lot of attention has been given to the fall in house prices and the collapse in mortgage lending and to the reduction in the number of new homes being built for sale, but the real pressure, which existed in my constituency even before the problems in the housing market during the past year, is on people who need to rent a home when there are no homes to rent. I shall repeat the figures that I gave during a debate last week. In my constituency last year, Sheffield Homes, which is the arm's length management organisation for social rented housing that covers most of my constituency, let only 12 three-bedroomed houses in the whole constituency to people who were not homeless or demolition priority. That is the scale of the crisis. Every month, I see that number of people in desperate housing need, but only 12 homes a year are available. That is the tip of the iceberg of people who come to see me. The problem already existed, and the Government had a target of building 50,000 new homes in the next spending review period and 45,000 immediately. The reality is that that target will not be delivered in the current circumstances. The package of measures that they introduced a few weeks ago included bringing forward the building of 5,000 new homes and the necessary finance. That is welcome and necessary, but it is totally inadequate in current circumstances. Shelter welcomed that package but said that it did not go far enough. We need a significant injection of funds for housing associations and local authorities to build new homes for rent. That would also boost the economy in these difficult times and kick-start it, as well as helping to maintain jobs in the construction industry and providing badly needed new homes. Housing associations deliver the vast majority of homes for social renting. The National Housing Federation said that the current housing association model will not work in the current broken market. That is a damning statement, but it is true. More than half of new homes were being built under section 106 agreements, but they are not being built now: builders are not building new homes for sale, so they are not building section 106 houses for rent either. Some housing associations are involved in development, and because the amount of social housing grant is only 40 to 50 per cent. of the cost of a scheme, they often build homes for sale as part of their package of building to cross-subsidise the homes that they are building for rent. As they cannot obtain the finance to build homes for sale, given that the wholesale market has dried up and people are not lending to them because they are worried about their ability to sell on those homes, they cannot build houses to rent either. Private developers are slowing down the building of section 106 homes, and housing associations are also having to slow down. That is a real problem for the provision of social housing to rent.",50153,[],Housing,0,7,housing,886
2008-11-12,Housing,534,Andrew George,LibDem,False,"At the start of his speech, the hon. Gentleman announced that he supported the Government's target of 3 million homes by 2020. Does he agree that there is a worry that they may be confusing means with ends and that simply building 3 million homes in the belief that that will solve the problem is the means to the end? Surely, the end is to meet housing need, and in the current climate, it would be better to ensure that the houses that are needed are built, especially if the private sector cannot deliver housing in the present climate.",50153,[],Housing,0,8,housing,99
2008-11-12,Housing,535,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"I agree. The Government's estimates were widely recognised as being a step forward in thinking. They had analysed the growth in the number of households and matched that with the number of houses that needed to be built. Most people welcomed their commitment of 3 million new homes by 2020, and 50,000 homes a year to rent. One may argue whether that should be higher, but at least we are on the right track. The reality is that the figures have been blown considerably off course by the current problems. Demand for social rented housing is as high as it was, and the 50,000 target, at least, must be reached, but it looks as though we are going backwards because of the problems that I have identified. In addition, many people who would have tried to buy their homes but cannot do so, because of the problems in the mortgage market, are also having to rent, and demand for rented housing is probably higher than expected. There is increased demand for rented housing and the possibility of supply being reduced. That is a challenge for the Government. I am looking for a step change in thinking. It may not come today, because the Minister may not have his brief to announce it, but I hope that when he considers his package of economic stimuli during the next week he will agree that the house-building industry, and particularly building houses for rent, is an essential element of that package.

2008-11-12,Housing,537,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"I may have a slight difference of opinion, because I think numbers are important, although I accept-we had this discussion in the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government-that lots of flats are being built in city centres, as in my constituency. I am against that, because we are desperately short of family homes, particularly homes to rent, and that is what we should concentrate on here and now. The Local Government Association says that one in 10 people are on housing waiting lists in some areas. I accept that not everyone on a waiting list is in immediate need of housing, but many are, and we must try to deal with the problem. The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) referred to local authorities and housing associations being able to buy houses, and the Government made finance available in their package in September. That was welcome, but it is probably not sufficient. Schemes in my constituency have come to a standstill, and the next phase is not going ahead. Lots of houses have already been built and are standing empty, and many people who want homes are on a waiting list. With more finance, the Government could put the two together and quickly deal with the urgent housing need. The Government ought to tell local authorities that they have a responsibility to co-ordinate this action and to look at the building of new homes, that they need to consider purchasing homes that are lying empty in the private market and that they must work with their housing associations and consider, with the advice centres and citizens advice bureaux, what advice should be given to people who are having housing difficulties in relation to paying their mortgage.

2008-11-12,Housing,539,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"Obviously, there will not be a review of the housing revenue accounts system in time for the Chancellor's announcement of a package of proposals next week. We have been told that the review will take place in the middle of next year. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. The issues that I hope will fundamentally be addressed are how rents are fixed centrally and the inability of organisations-housing associations and particularly ALMOs-to plan ahead because they do not know what the subsidy will be in the next two or three years. The problem of not being able to use capital receipts locally also needs to be dealt with. In relation to social rented housing, there is a real problem with the housing revenue account system, which is like an albatross around the neck of future development. I hope that that issue will be tackled, although I think that the reality is that we will not receive a response from the review until the middle of next year. Other hon. Members want to contribute, so I will conclude my remarks. I have tried to indicate that there are probably no quick fixes to the current problems with buying and selling homes. One or two things could be done-for example, improving shared ownership. Future problems include a potential spike in house prices and a lack of building that will lead to a lack of training and a shortage of workers. The Government need to think about those matters. Things can be done to keep people in their homes and the Government have acted on some of them, but more can be done-for example, by co-ordinating advice locally. Money should be put into the building of houses for rent in the current market if we are to avoid a decline in those numbers at this time of great pressure. In some ways, it is opportune that the new Homes and Communities Agency comes into being next month. The agency probably would not have picked this time to come into being, but we should strongly welcome the fact that that is happening now. The agency will be able to co-ordinate local authority action, and I know that Sir Bob Kerslake, the chief executive, believes that tackling this issue is about not central delivery, but delivery through local authorities. I certainly welcome that. I hope that the agency will have an enhanced budget to enable it to work with local authorities and housing associations to build extra homes. At a time when land prices are falling, it might well be that some of that money could initially be put into land purchase. If the public sector were to buy up land for future schemes, that would be welcome and could be done to anticipate future needs when the industry is in better health. The agency could also consider the co-ordination of advice through local authorities and others to help people who have a particular housing need. The Homes and Communities Agency has a massive task, and it is opportune that it is about to come into being. I am certainly looking forward to hearing its proposals and seeing how it will react. I want the agency to work through local authorities, as they have a key role to play. However, in the end, neither the agency nor local authorities and housing associations will be able to deliver unless the Government step up to the mark now and provide substantial extra funding. That will not only kick-start jobs and building in the industry but ensure that we address the fundamental problem of a massive shortage of houses to rent, which, in the current circumstances, will only get worse.",50153,[],Housing,0,13,housing,613

2008-11-12,Housing,541,Paddy Tipping,Lab,False,"I am delighted to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) in this important and timely debate. I agree with the third point he made: it is vital that hard-working families and people have the opportunity to get decent affordable rented housing. He is right to say that for that to happen we need to ensure that housing associations and local authorities have extra resources, so that they can tackle the job. In my area, Ashfield Homes has as many people on the waiting list as there are houses available. That is the scale of the problem. I shall follow a different tack from my hon. Friend and talk about the housing element of the east midlands spatial strategy and the effect of the present economic crisis on that. The Minister will know that consultation on the spatial strategy finished on 17 October, but I hope that he will take my speech as a late submission. He will perhaps know that on 17 October, the East Midlands regional assembly announced a partial review of the spatial strategy-a strategy that is not yet agreed. If the planning framework is already changing and in doubt, what does that mean for long-term planning? The central issue of the regional strategy is housing, which has been a contentious matter in Nottinghamshire. In the housing core area in Nottingham-basically, the Greater Nottingham area-the expectation is that 70,000 new houses will be built by 2026. Earlier this year, local authorities produced a sustainable urban extension study, which considered possible sites in greenfield and green belt areas. That caused widespread alarm. There is a perception in Nottingham that green belt and greenfield sites will be eaten up. Importantly, last Monday, local authorities published a second study, which has the even grander name of the strategic housing land availability assessment and which considers areas to be developed within the urban area. The current position is that roughly half the houses needed could be developed on what might be called brownfield sites in the urban area, and half on green belt and greenfield sites. The essential question, which has already been mentioned in the debate, is, what kind of houses are to be built and where will they be placed? My anxiety arises from the fact that the market as it has operated in the past has delivered what I call executive homes: five-bedroomed homes with two cars on the drive on greenfield sites. What drives the market is the unfortunate fact that more and more families split up and require two homes instead of one; in addition, all of us are living longer. Now, instead of widespread erosion of the green belt, we need smaller, sustainable homes that are closer to town centres and have good transport links. I am concerned that the East Midlands regional assembly now says that it intends to revise the housing estimates and that it considers the Prime Minister's pledge to build 3 million homes by 2020 to be important. The demand to consider having more homes on greenfield and green belt sites will be irresistible. I simply say to the Minister that such houses are not needed for ordinary hard-working people. There are plenty of new flats in the city of Nottingham-the place is awash with flats that cannot be sold-but it is essential to have some family housing to give hope to children for their future. I want us to move forward quickly and have a planning system and a regional spatial strategy that have that principle at their core. Investment should be made in brownfield sites before greenfield. The Government have a good record. They have exceeded their 60 per cent. target in the east midlands and have roughly achieved the figure of 75 per cent. We need more, but it will progressively become more difficult.",50153,[],Housing,0,15,housing,640
2008-11-12,Housing,542,John Leech,LibDem,False,"The hon. Gentleman makes some valid points. Is not one of the problems that brownfield sites often lend themselves to big developments of flats, rather than family homes?

2008-11-12,Housing,543,Paddy Tipping,Lab,False,"The hon. Gentleman is right, and the point that he makes was pursued by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe. We need mechanisms to ensure that the market and the way we intervene in it deliver the answer to housing need, rather than the solution that brings profit to house builders. Unfortunately, up to this point, we have not been able to achieve that. My plea to the Minister is this. He will now receive the results of the consultation on the east midlands regional spatial strategy. I hope that he will examine closely the housing element of it and that he will make it his strong and firm policy that what is important is smaller, sustainable homes near urban areas, rather than wholesale erosion of the green belt. There is talk of an eco-town in Nottinghamshire on the site of RAF Newton. The present proposal is, to put it in professional terms, absolutely bonkers, but RAF Newton is a site with potential-potential for a smaller community, not the large scheme planned at the moment. With imagination, good planning and good design, a scheme could be developed on that site. I hope that the Minister will assure us again that if houses are built there, they will count against the housing numbers in the regional strategy. What it is important to get from this debate, from Government policy and from the autumn statement when it comes in the next few days, is a set of measures to ensure that there is hope for people in desperate need of housing.

2008-11-12,Housing,544,Matthew Taylor,LibDem,False,"I shall concentrate on specific measures that could help to resolve the problems that have been so well set out by those who have already spoken. As the Minister knows, I was asked to report to the Government on rural housing need. The report was produced in July, and I am glad to say that it received a lot of support from the Government. We now await a response. I will not go through the 48 recommendations, not least because many of them are for the longer term, but also because we do not have time to do so. I shall concentrate today on more immediate measures. When the report was being drawn up, we were already seeing the beginnings of the current economic problems. The background, which I discussed in the report, is that housing need does not go away because house builders are no longer building houses. The fact that people cannot get mortgages to buy and that, at a time of falling house prices, people are unwilling to buy because they think that properties might be cheaper next week than they are this, does not alter the increase in household numbers and family break-ups, the fact that people are living longer, the fact that people are more likely to want to live alone, for a variety of reasons, or the fact that people aspire to a home of their own. All that pressure, which led the Government to their target of 3 million homes-whether it is right or wrong, we are still talking about a lot more housing need over the coming years-is not going away. What happens in a recession and what is happening now is that our ability to solve the problems and provide solutions is eroded because house builders will not build. That has a knock-on consequence, which we have heard about, for housing associations, because the majority of affordable housing being built is on the back of private sector development. A massive loss of affordable housing provision is now starting to hit because new developments are not being started and even existing developments are not being completed. At the same time, people are less able, because of rising unemployment, to afford homes, so there is greater pressure on the affordable housing sector. There is more need for affordable housing. Dealing with the problems that I have described is difficult in the short term. In the long term, we may be creating an even bigger problem, because as we come out of the current situation and people start to be able to buy, the houses will not be there for them to buy. That may ratchet up prices and we may go back into the same cycle. I know that Ministers are aware of that. As there is not much time, I shall run through my four suggestions as quickly as I can. The first is obvious and I know that Ministers are considering it. The more the funding programme over the current spending round can be brought forward so that, in particular, the Homes and Communities Agency and current projects can forward-spend now on affordable housing projects, the better, partly because that helps to fill the hole in planned affordable housing delivered through private sector development and partly because it is counter-cyclical spending. I think that Ministers understand that. If more money can be found, that will be even more welcome, but even in terms of the funds that have already been allocated, bringing forward spending is important. Nevertheless, it is important that people think long term and not just short term with that housing development. The measure is not just an economic solution and a fiscal stimulus; it is about the housing provision needed in the long term. I agree with the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) that there are an awful lot of flats in cities that cannot be sold by the private sector. However, to put it bluntly, they probably could not be sold by the private sector even if we were not in a recession, because there has been massive over-provision. Although the Government acquiring large numbers of one-bedroomed flats in the middle of cities may appear to be an easy solution, that would not meet the priority housing need of families. The last thing they need is a cheaply built flat in the centre of town that was not even built to affordable home standards in terms of space, with no garden and so on. We need more family homes. To divert money into bailing out the private sector to too great an extent would simply saddle the state with undesirable city-centre flats that have not been built to the standards of affordable homes, that are not as well insulated, that do not have the space and that, in the end, could provide the state with the next generation of slum housing, particularly if it is all affordable housing so that whole blocks of flats are built up. There may be room for some within it.",50153,[],Housing,0,18,housing,840
2008-11-12,Housing,545,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"I take the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. We are desperately short of family houses and buying up flats in city centres would not necessarily be a solution to all the problems, but certainly I see many couples, for example, who just want a home. If they knew that the allocations policies were such that, by going into one of the flats that the local authority has bought in the city centre, they might have a chance, probably in a year or two years' time, of moving on and they would not be pushed down the waiting list because they had accepted that flat in the first place, there might be some room for buying such flats to help some people on the list.",50153,[],Housing,0,19,housing,126
2008-11-12,Housing,546,Matthew Taylor,LibDem,False,"There is room for buying some. I simply sound a note of caution about how far that policy is taken. There was another point in the hon. Gentleman's comments, to which I shall return at the end, about how more flexible approaches might be taken. It is important that the estates we build are mixed. The lessons of the past are that, in the long run, large rented estates create problems of their own, however well they may have been built in the first instance. The developments should contain both rented properties and properties that are affordable to buy. Where appropriate, it would be great to have some private sector housing in that mix, too, but that may be more problematic at the moment. That brings me to a core point, where I think the Government have a role. There is now clear evidence that part of the squeeze on the mortgage sector is squeezing out part-buy affordable housing and, indeed, affordable housing where people buy, under a section 106 deal, the freehold but at a capped price that is affordable to local people. In both cases, there seems to be evidence that the mortgage companies, only a small number of which were willing to provide mortgages in those circumstances anyway, are in effect pulling out of providing mortgages at all. They have not announced that; the policy is not official, but it seems to be happening. That is reflected in housing associations now being unwilling to build part-ownership properties and in part-ownership properties being transferred over to the rented sector because people are not coming forward to buy them. There are a number of housing estates in my constituency-estates being built by housing associations or in the development phase and estates that have already been built-where the part-ownership properties have been transferred over to rent because the mortgages are not available. I cannot emphasise enough to the Minister the fact that that is not because they are not desired or needed; it is happening because people cannot get a mortgage on them. There is a clear role for the Government in helping those individuals, which will be of both short-term and long-term benefit. In the short term it will help people to buy those properties, and in the long term it will help to ensure that estates remain mixed and have people with a range of needs and social backgrounds, rather than becoming purely more traditional tenanted estates, with some of the long-term problems that that can cause. The Government have a role to play. Given their current interest in and talks with the banks, perhaps they will be able to put together a package that deals with mortgage availability. In addition, I remember not so long ago when councils provided mortgages. Perhaps we should think about that again for those types of property. That could be done together with lenders, and might reduce some of the risks they fear. Ironically, such properties are relatively low risk. The demand for low-cost home ownership packages remains even when the market falls. The value of those properties is unlikely to fall much, especially if it is linked to local wage levels rather than local house prices. Thirdly, the report argues for a long-term planning process to create sustainable communities and new neighbourhoods. That should include a mix of housing, work opportunities and leisure facilities, not just estate-by-estate development. With the break in the market, more available land and a fall in the level of development, we have an opportunity to ensure that the next generation of development will create sustainable communities, community extensions and new neighbourhoods. Throughout the '80s and '90s we simply saw places doughnutted by estates. Sustainable developments have the advantage of being properly planned. They involve a partnership between long-term investors and local authorities, with the result that the developments have greater stability. Of course, in a downturn that might fall back, but it will not be lost altogether as it is part of a longer-term scheme. The current fluctuation gives us the opportunity to pull into that long-term planning. I raised this final point during a debate on the economy last week, and I would like to elaborate on it slightly now. At the moment, the Government are pushing councils to reduce the use of temporary housing. I have never been much in favour of people living in temporary housing. In my part of the world, that usually means bed and breakfast-not the sort of bed and breakfast where one might go on holiday, but houses in multiple occupation where people are kicked out during the day. Young families, people with children or single parents often do not have a base during the day, and I have always been against that kind of temporary accommodation. The shortage of affordable housing has meant that councils have been taking long leases on private sector properties to provide what is classed as temporary accommodation, but which often provides good-quality accommodation for a year or two. The accommodation is in someone's house, but for one reason or another the owner does not occupy it so it can be let to the local authority. The local authority provides guarantees on rent and on the condition in which the house will be handed back to the original owner. The process is therefore relatively risk-free for owners and supplies them with a guaranteed income stream, while providing housing for the kind of people to whom the private sector-for all sorts of reasons-is often unwilling to rent, but who are nevertheless in housing need. Current policy presses councils to decrease their use of that system, but in the current circumstances, many houses are coming on to the market for rent because people cannot sell them. In addition, the number of people going on to the housing registers is likely to increase because of the economic circumstances. It would therefore make sense to take on those unsold houses or flats, not necessarily by buying them but by using that kind of lease. Encouraging councils to do that would be helpful. It would reduce the flood of unsold houses on to estate agents' books and would meet immediate housing needs, without requiring the Government to take on the capital asset of properties that might not be appropriate for a long-term base of affordable housing.",50153,[],Housing,0,20,housing,1057
2008-11-12,Housing,547,Austin Mitchell,Lab,False,"I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) on securing the debate and on his brilliant speech. I agree wholeheartedly with the arguments that he made. The housing situation today contrasts sadly with the high hopes of last year, when I composed my famous lines, â€œBliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be MP for Hartlepool was very heaven.â€ We had hopes of a big building drive, a Minister in the Cabinet to push it forward and councils that were allowed to build. What has happened since? We have been through three Housing Ministers and the target of 3 million new houses by 2020-not enough, according to calculations by Shelter-has been demoted to an aspiration. Building is falling of a cliff and new starts are down dramatically. Private builders are not building because they are going bust and housing associations do not build as they, too, have been hit by the credit squeeze. They now face the problem that right-to-buy sales are drying up and revenue is not coming in. The buy-to-let market has collapsed along with the collapse of its main financier, Bradford & Bingley building society, and despite all the promises, councils have still not been allowed to build effectively. To add insult to injury, the guide rent increase for this year and next is 6 per cent. on council rents. That is above the rate of inflation and well above the historic cost average of previous rent increases. That is monstrous. The Government are draining huge sums out of housing revenue accounts, and with the rent increase, those sums will get bigger. That money should go to housing, not to the Government. The second addition of insult to injury is the scheme floated in The Times on Monday. It is the insane idea of turning council housing into the ghetto of last resort. It suggested that secure tenancies would end, tenancies would be reviewed, and if people were somehow not worthy of the fatherland, or employment or whatever, they would be booted out to make room for people on the waiting list. We should make room for people on the waiting list only by building more houses, not by booting out existing tenants. It is a ludicrous scheme and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will wholeheartedly disavow it. We will not get anywhere near the build targets that we need over the next crucial two years in the developing situation. We are meeting on a cold November day in the grip of a gathering recession, and the best answer to recession is to build. What can be built most quickly? Houses. They are not huge railway projects on the east coast line, or Crossrail-those things take years to organise and build, but houses can be built quickly. In the 1930s, house building was the major answer to a depression, perhaps even more important than the rearmament programme. The building of those estates put people back to work and solved the immediate problem. The immediate problem now is that we need public housing to rent for those who cannot afford to get on the ladder, and for the increasing number of people who will be thrown out in repossessions over the coming year as negative equity grips the market. That public housing could come from housing associations-social housing-but it should also come from councils. In the Government's rush to encourage ownership, there is one aspect of economics that we have not understood. We can have ownership, but unless we build public housing for rent pari passu with private build, the cost of private building goes up faster than it would otherwise. Other European countries, where there is a far higher proportion of rented housing, have not seen the insane price escalation that has taken place in this country. We must also build housing for rent to provide for those who cannot get on the housing ladder. Otherwise, people get on to the housing ladder when they cannot quite make it. That is the sub-prime crisis in this country. Unless we build public houses for rent, people will be pushed into ownership when they cannot sustain it. That is what has been happening. We must build private and public houses pari passu. It is crucial that we have a big building programme. Who can do that? As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe said, it could be done by the housing association and we could improvise in all sorts of ways involving local housing companies. I am not keen on that, but it is an innovation and should be tried. Mainly, however, the move must come from local authorities and council house building. They can supply what is needed, provided that we finance them to come back into building. That can be done in one of two ways. One is by letting local authorities keep their own money. Instead of Government draining Â£1.5 billion every year from housing revenue accounts for their own purposes, we could let local authorities keep those funds. We could let them borrow by paying adequate management and maintenance grants-which are 40 per cent. underfunded-so that they can borrow on a stream of revenue. We could do that. The Government are reviewing council housing finance, but that will take until next year, and it will not be implemented until 2010. What is going to happen in 2010? There will be an election. We will have made ourselves odious in housing estates around the country but we are not doing anything about the predicament. Unless we take action by building council houses and regenerating the estates, the Government will have failed.",50153,[],Housing,0,21,housing,948

His argument was certainly political in the past, but does he agree that this is now also a pragmatic issue? We have talked about housing associations. Some may be able to respond if extra funds come in, but in the current circumstances some may not. Housing companies may be a possibility, but it is technically difficult to set them up and they are not an immediate answer. The pilots and the arm's length management organisations will produce only a handful of properties.

We can take less from their housing revenue accounts-the fourth option-or pay a direct development grant for councils to build, which would not be all that expensive. Councils need to be lured back into building. Only they can put private builders back to work, with contracts to build council housing. That is what is needed. We have a waiting list of 1.6 million who will never get a house. We have a huge waiting list in Grimsby and north-east Lincolnshire. Those people are not going to get anywhere because we are not building houses for them to move into. We should put the councils in a financial position to start building and let them trigger a building boom. Frankly, the only solution to our current difficulties is to build, build, and build again.",50153,[],Housing,0,23,housing,161
2008-11-12,Housing,550,Martin Horwood,LibDem,False,"I shall try to keep within the time limit, Mrs. Dean, although I shall have to skip some of the arguments that I wished to expand on. However, I agree with much of what has been said, so that should be relatively easy. We are clearly in a market downturn for housing, but I hope that it will be seen, at least in part, as a market correction. I hope that we will never again see a return to the ludicrous housing market that we have experienced over the past 10 years. Insane multiples of people's salaries were being offered for mortgages, and people were targeted by the sub-prime market on the conscious and frankly immoral understanding that they could not afford to repay the loans that were being offered-and in which a 25 per cent. deposit was regarded as ludicrously large. I slightly take issue with the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), although I generally agree with him. Many years ago, when I first tried to get on the housing property ladder, the 90 per cent. mortgage was almost unheard of. Increasing multiples and increasing lending have fuelled house price inflation to a great degree. House price inflation has been based, at least in part, on spiralling personal debt. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) often pointed that out at the time. The Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, of which the hon. Gentleman and I were both members several years ago, made that point when considering the supply of land for housing:â€œMany witnesses pointed to the complexity of the housing market. There are many factors, other than supply, which affect affordability of housing. It is important for the Government to avoid an over-simplistic reliance on one policy and to examine a range of strategies which might influence demand.â€It went on to say:â€œThe particular nature of the housing market means a simple supply and demand model cannot be applied to the housing market. With the multitude of factors affecting house prices it is very difficult to support an increase in housing supply simply on the basis of improving affordability.â€That, of course, was the question that was asked of Kate Barker. She was asked not to consider housing need as such, but to tell us how much of an increase in supply would be needed to affect affordability. She probably gave a legitimate answer, but the question was wrong and rather dangerous. I draw the Minister's attention to an article written by Merryn Somerset Webb, the editor-in-chief of Money Week, only the other week. He wrote:â€œIt is true that Brown's targets will not be met, but that doesn't mean that the shortage of supply is getting worse-mainly because there was no shortage of supply in the first place.â€",50153,[],Housing,0,24,housing,468

Members have referred are to do with localised patterns of supply and demand, and the differing balance of various kinds of housing. They are absolutely right. The lack of social housing and affordable housing is chronic, and the imbalance between family homes and flats is a problem. However, there has not been a lack of supply overall. Merryn Somerset Webb continued:â€œIf there weren't enough houses in the UK, why would Paddington Basin-home to hundreds of new build flats-be pitch black at night? Why would the centres of Leeds and Manchester be jammed with empty and utterly unlettable, let alone unsaleable flats? And how would the FT magazine have managed to find several almost entirely empty housing estates to base a cover story on last weekend?â€The Empty Homes Agency estimates that Britain has 840,000 empty homes.

2008-11-12,Housing,554,Martin Horwood,LibDem,False,"I am terribly sorry; I really do not have time, otherwise I would do so. Even if we question some of the statements about supply, as some hon. Members might, serious social and environmental consequences will result from the Government's strategy. One of them has been alluded to this morning. About 8,100 new homes are planned for the urban area in my constituency. That plan is supported by almost all parties. If 40 per cent. of those houses were for social housing-I tend to agree with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) that they should be overwhelmingly social housing for rent-every person on Cheltenham's housing waiting list would have a home. The trouble is that that is not the total number. The regional spatial strategy pushes the number up to 13,800. As a result, 5,000 will have to be built on the green belt to the north of Cheltenham and 1,300 on the greenfield sites to the south. The consequences of that are clear for the wider housing market and for areas of housing deprivation and areas in need of regeneration. Professor Ian Cole, who may be from the constituency of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, gave evidence to the ODPM Committee all those years ago. He said thatâ€œit would be entirely misleading to view this in terms of â€˜the North' catching up â€˜the South': the disparities are still intense. The Barker recommendations, focused on easing supply constraints in high demand areasâ€-like those in my constituency-â€œwould simply intensify these differences, with acute difficulties for labour mobility, the revival of vulnerable local markets and the capacity of the construction industry.â€The West Midlands regional assembly made the same point in evidence. It said that focusing growth on areas that are already affluent, already growing and already prosperous undermines attempts at urban regeneration. Focusing on supply is a problem because, as a result, we ignore the real issue-the chronic lack of social housing. Historically, house building numbers decreased not because of the private sector, which was relatively consistent over the decades, but because of the collapse after Mrs. Thatcher's intervention and the resulting inability of councils and other social landlords to buy and build social housing for rent. That needs to be tackled urgently. I entirely agree with other hon. Members on that point. The environmental consequences are serious. I have considered the matter mainly from a constituency perspective. A huge proportion of our green belt is about to be bulldozed by developers. Of course, the developers are not considering the brownfield sites but are heading first for the greenfield sites. We are fighting one planning appeal after another, all on greenfield sites. The developers are not considering brownfield sites at all. The Environmental Audit Committee's recent report highlighted the acute risk that in this sort of market greedy developers will develop the greenfield sites first. That is happening. There is no shortage of enthusiasm among developers for providing houses around my constituency, but they are all on greenfield sites. The risk is acute. However, the Campaign to Protect Rural England says that the problem is nationwide. It estimates from the various regional spatial strategies that 27,000 hectares of greenfield land are under imminent threat. That is an area the size of Birmingham. We should consider the climate change consequences of such a new build-developing an average new build house probably results in at least three to four times the carbon footprint of converting an existing property. We should also consider the loss of agricultural land and greenfield areas, which are loved and valued by, and good for, local people. Mind's â€œEcotherapyâ€ report and reports by the Countryside Agency and others emphasise how important green spaces are to people. It all adds up to an environmental catastrophe. The Government have the power to reconsider the sequential test. Even if we agree that we need these houses, at the very least we should develop brownfield sites first and greenfield sites last. That way we will avoid many of the social and environmental consequences of current housing policies.",50153,[],Housing,0,28,housing,676
2008-11-12,Housing,555,Julia Goldsworthy,LibDem,False,"I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) on securing this important debate. The fact that so many hon. Members focused on the lack of social housing underlines where the heart of the problem lies. More generally, however, the housing market is unfortunately in the middle of a perfect storm: falling house prices, a market downturn, and supply and affordability crises. Those are the difficult issues that we must unravel. The problem cannot be solved by focusing purely on social housing, because so much of the housing market interrelates. I am concerned that the Government's primary focus has remained on private sector housing to buy, but no real attempt has been made to boost the supply of affordable housing to rent. Dealing with that will be critical to dealing with the wider problems. Of course, the private sector is important, but it is in a freeze at the moment. Some of the Government's actions do not seem to have helped matters. As has been mentioned, we have had the stamp duty holiday, which has made matters worse over the summer. Constituents of mine have had their exchanges fall through because the buyers have said, â€œThere's no way I'm going through with this when there could be an imminent announcement of a stamp duty holiday.â€ I have also received anecdotal evidence that home information packs are causing real problems. Some of my constituents are not putting their properties on the market. They are worried that they will not sell their properties and that they will simply be throwing away a few hundred pounds, because they will have to take them off the market. Although some estate agents have offered to cover those costs, that is only on condition of sale. Has such anecdotal evidence been gathered nationally to assess the impact of that uncertainty? The Government's response remains focused on shared ownership schemes, which are proving difficult. Constituents have come to me because they have found it difficult to negotiate their way around the first-time buyer and shared ownership schemes. In my constituency, where house prices are incredibly high and incomes very low, many people have failed to qualify. The emphasis has been on helping public sector workers, but such workers in Cornwall are relatively well paid. People on very low incomes, on the other hand, have gone through the rigmarole of being told that they are entitled, only to find out at the last minute that they are not. Hon. Gentlemen are right that the key problem is that, effectively, lenders are withdrawing from the market and viewing the schemes as 100 per cent. mortgages, but there is no such thing anymore. They simply are not being offered. Rather than simply re-announcing investment available to those schemes, the Government need to take a long, hard look at whether they are helping people who want to buy in areas where affordability is in crisis. In Cornwall and elsewhere, buying a home remains completely out of reach. The Government need to bear in mind that informal withdrawal from the market. Simply saying, â€œThe money is there,â€ does not mean that people will take up the schemes. Let us consider the knock-on effect. In the past few years, many people have overstretched themselves massively. It is important to ensure that steps are in place to protect them, as they face difficulties repaying their mortgages. The recent court case that found that repossession orders after two missed payments were justified was very worrying. Do we need to give guidance to courts saying that repossession should be a last resort, or do we need primary legislation and regulation? What can we do to make it clearer that mortgage terms can be renegotiated to prevent people from having their houses repossessed? What are the Government doing to regulate sale and leaseback, which is a resort that people often look to, but which they do not really understand? It is not properly regulated and could leave people in an even worse situation. What are the Government doing to develop schemes to staircase down? The focus remains on helping people to staircase up into home ownership, but there is no clarity about what can be done to help people to staircase down, which provides amazing opportunities for registered social landlords to pepper-pot, to prevent people from losing their homes and to increase the supply of affordable rented housing. What can the Minister do to drive forward that agenda? My other concern about those who face such difficulties is the differing regional impact. A colleague told me that repossessions in Kingston are down. We expect the trend to be upwards, but that problem does yet not appear to be feeding through, which is surprising given that so much of the slump is focusing on the financial services sector. We would expect the London area to be hardest hit, but of course we are talking about people with relatively higher incomes and bigger reserves to fall back on. Perhaps the bump will come later. In Cornwall, however, we see quite a lot of distressed home owners and repossession orders in the courts. What is the Minister's understanding of the regional impact? What advice is available to people in difficulty? Demand is far outstripping the supply of support. Forty per cent. of citizens advice bureaux calls go unanswered, because they cannot cope with the number of people asking for help, although that is not just on housing matters-perhaps on rent arrears and so on. However, what can the Government do to ensure a clear route for those in financial difficulty, so that they can receive the necessary support and advice? So much remains dependent on the voluntary and charitable sector. It was struggling to deal with numbers before, but things look like getting worse.",50153,[],Housing,0,29,housing,966

2008-11-12,Housing,557,Julia Goldsworthy,LibDem,False,"My hon. Friend underlines my point. The concern is that events in the mortgage market are having a knock-on effect in the social and private rented markets. Some of the most distressed selling is in the buy-to-let market. Again, there is more uncertainty in private rented tenancies. Are the Government monitoring repossessions on the basis of whether they involve owner-occupied or buy-to-let properties? That might offer an explanation. One would imagine a surge in the supply of private rented accommodation, but rental prices do no appear to be falling. Is the Minister's Department monitoring that? The social rented sector is the key issue. Even if the Government were steadily hitting their target of 50,000 new homes a year, it would allow them only to keep pace with the problem. We could be facing a massive surge in demand for social rented housing, and it is not clear exactly how the Government will respond. Some 1.7 million people are on the waiting list, and in many places, the number of people on waiting lists is greater than the stock of social housing. The Government's announcements are not enough. The key problem is that social house building has reinforced the cycle. In the boom times, it reinforced the boom, but now we are in the bust, nothing is being introduced under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Many registered social landlords depend on private sales to fund their social housing. That is also reinforcing the bust. We must break out of that cycle, and the Government have not done enough to do that. Figures were announced yesterday on the clearing house deal, which is supposed to help to free up affordable rented housing for social use in areas in which it is needed most. Following a scheme that was announced in May, 1,531 homes have been purchased for social-rent use. If we consider the areas of greatest need, however, only 18 homes have been purchased for social-rent use. In all the areas in which the demand is greatest, the least is being done. That brings us back to the fundamental issue of what happens to housing revenue account subsidy. Tackling that is important, as is allowing councils to borrow. Councils are sensitive to the problems, but they do not have the flexibility to deal with them. I have lots more to say, but I will close by highlighting the good work that is going on locally to tackle some of the problems. Councils such as Oldham are expanding their equity loan schemes to try to get empty properties back into use and to encourage the owners of those properties to get them back into use. Forums are being set up with local mortgage lenders. Some councils are keen to get into leaseback and rent-back schemes and social mortgage schemes. Will the Minister tell us what his Department is doing to connect with local communities, which best understand their own needs and are proactive in proposing solutions? Should the Department not see its responsibility as supporting local solutions, rather than sitting on high and coming up with bigger packages that do not hit the intended targets? Areas of most critical need are not seeing the benefit of the measures. I hope the Minister will address those issues.",50153,[],Housing,0,31,housing,548

We cannot look at this issue without analysing the Government's lamentable record on housing-no one else has said that, so it is worth while mentioning it. The moral of the story is that the top-down approach has failed since 1997. Under Labour, about 148,000 homes have been built each year, compared with 171,000 between 1979 and 1996.

2008-11-12,Housing,562,Stewart Jackson,Con,False,"No, I am afraid that I do not have time. The Home Buy Direct scheme was initially considering 120,000 units. In the middle of last year, we were looking at 207. Home information packs have done nothing to add to the viability of the housing market. The Government's own trials, which cost Â£5 million, have shown that they have largely failed to add to the viability of the wider market. The dithering over stamp duty, which the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) mentioned, had a demonstrably negative effect on the housing market. One had only to talk to the National Association of Estate Agents to confirm such a view. Eco-towns are a prime example of the Government's short-termism and a discredited failure. If such a policy were a pet budgie, one would take it to the vet and have it put down. The Minister for Housing is to pull the plug on the scheme and kill it off gracefully, as only she can. She is doing that after admitting that her predecessor misled the House on whether such projects would be built on greenfield or brownfield sites. The Government are still fiddling the planning process to squeeze out local decision makers-elected councillors-from such decisions. Where does that leave us? Our Prime Minister, the great helmsman, announced some incredibly ambitious, but massively unrealistic, house building targets in June 2007. Were such targets an ambition or a policy? The Government are not singing from the same hymn sheet in that respect. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors expects the number of new-built homes to be fewer than 100,000 units. The Government's limited attempts to kick-start the housing market, which we have supported, seem doomed to fail because they lack ambition. The Home Buy Direct scheme will work only if the 70 per cent. that the homebuyers have to find is lent by lenders, but such buyers are considered sub-prime mortgage holders and they will have grave difficulty in securing that funding, and we will be no further forward. The wider picture shows that just 33,000 loans for new properties were approved in September. The latest figure from the National House-Building Council shows that newly registered homes are down 68 per cent. in the 12 months to October 2008. Average daily sales are down 22 per cent. in the same 12-month period. As other hon. Members have said, the Government have failed on housing supply in a decade of boom. Now that we are at the beginning of the bust, they are unable to meet demand. The housing market is seizing up and developments are collapsing. Therefore, what should we consider in the immediate term? The hon. Member for Cheltenham talked about the use of greenfield and brownfield sites. The Government are not doing everything that they can about the remediation of brownfield sites and are not assisting developers to get that tenure mix correct by helping them to develop such sites in a timely way. If the Conservatives were in power, we would take direct action on stamp duty. We would scrap home information packs and regional spatial strategy housing targets because we are committed to localism. We believe that local people will deliver if they are given an incentive and provided with the infrastructure to make it feasible and viable to develop. There is not a great chasm between us and the Liberal Democrats in that respect. Moreover, we would consider new initiatives such as community land trusts. I am glad that the Government have moved closer to our position on that since we debated primary legislation earlier this year. In addition, we must look at section 106 agreements, and we have to work with people locally. I agree with the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell on that, and I commend him for his report. There were many ideas in it that we would seek to put into practice in government, although not all of them. He has done a good job, particularly in focusing on the crisis in rural housing. The Government need to trust local communities and their elected representatives. We need incentives, infrastructure and the right type of housing in the right place. This Government have run out of ideas, they have run out of policies and soon they will have run out of time. We need a new Government committed to localism, with new ideas to revitalise the housing market fully. A Conservative Government would do that, as they have in the past.",50153,[],Housing,0,36,housing,751
2008-11-12,Housing,563,Iain Wright,Lab,False,"It is a pleasure to serve again under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) on securing this timely and important debate. I agreed with virtually everything he said. His analysis was astute and knowledgeable, and his expertise in the housing sector came out strongly. In fact, the whole debate has been knowledgeable, and I have agreed with an awful lot of what has been said, with the exception of the remarks of the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood); I do not think that I agreed with anything that he said. I was also disappointed with the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson). Given that we are facing immense difficulties and that hard-working families out there are frightened about their housing situation, I thought that his contribution was somewhat backward-looking and introspective, and I was not surprised that in the midst of the biggest global financial turbulence since the first world war and with a dire need to recapitalise the banks' balance sheets, the Conservatives' one tangible solution is to scrap home information packs. They will need a bit more than that to become a viable Opposition. I am conscious of time. We could spend a great many hours debating this important issue, but I will focus on three matters. I will summarise the housing market challenge that we face, which has been eloquently articulated by my hon. Friend and others; describe how we will prepare for the upturn and support the construction sector and hard-working families who fear a housing shortage or repossession; and discuss the role of local authorities and the Homes and Communities Agency, and how the relationship between them will be key as we move forward through the current turbulence towards the upturn. I will be up front. I am not going to shy away from the challenges that we face in the housing market. The Government recognise the massive challenges in housing due to turbulence in the global financial markets. As has been articulated well in the debate, house prices have fallen, people are finding it harder to get a suitable mortgage and house builders are experiencing very challenging business conditions. Housing associations, as a result of stresses on their business model with regard to section 106 agreements, are finding it difficult to provide the finance to build houses for rent. Most people's homes are worth far more than when they bought them, and mortgage rates are low by historical standards, but I do not want to be complacent about that and rest on my laurels, as it would be a wrong approach. These are undoubtedly difficult times for the housing market. Demand indicators have weakened and are forecast to remain weak. Buyer inquiries to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have fallen every month since the beginning of 2007, and unsold stock figures are poor. The basis for current circumstances is exceptional instability in the international financial markets. That is where we have taken the most urgent and radical action. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor should be commended on their work to help to recapitalise the banks. They have taken extraordinary measures for extraordinary times. That should help to address the underlying lack of liquidity and credit that has created a more risk-averse approach to lending among financial institutions and frozen the mortgage markets. It will take time, as has been said, but the housing market will start to see the benefit. It is encouraging that thanks to political pressure, not least by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Bank of England's 1.5 per cent. cut last week has been passed on. There is still work to be done, but the Government are putting pressure on the banks in that respect. Although the crisis is global in origin and nature, the Government are committed to taking direct action to alleviate pressures in the domestic housing market. This Government do not think that the current correction is a natural feature of free markets and that we should ride the storm. This Government are not a Government who say that the price is well worth paying or that if it is not hurting, it is not working. We are keen to ensure, and are committed to ensuring, that we take action and work day and night to address people's fears about repossessions and housing shortages, and to put policies and actions in place to help to mitigate those risks.",50153,[],Housing,0,37,housing,749

House prices have risen in recent years as a result of benign economic conditions and people's feeling of security in their jobs, but also as a function of the relationship between demand and supply.

2008-11-12,Housing,569,Iain Wright,Lab,False,"People in this country are living longer, and the way that they live is changing. I suggest that as we face an economic downturn, greater stress on households may result in family break-ups, which will put even more pressure on housing. This is my key message: despite the short-term turbulence, which we recognise, acknowledge and are taking steps to act on, we need to have sight of long-term factors. To echo the analogy used by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, we have been blown off course by global financial pressures, but the desert island that we need to get to- That lovely Caribbean island where everybody has a decent home that is of good quality and has good infrastructure and facilities is key. That is why the Prime Minister has made it a key part of the Government's agenda. My hon. Friend made some extremely good points about confusion over shared ownership. In the case of shared ownership and shared equity, there are different products for different markets, but I understand what he said, and I will take it away and consider it to ensure that we can negotiate our way clearly through the shared ownership model. I am keen not to lose skills in the construction sector as a result of the economic downturn. The Government have taken action, and we continue to reflect on it. For example, we have created an apprentice matching service in conjunction with Construction Skills, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Learning and Skills Council to help to retain apprentices with employers or place them with new ones if redundancy is being considered. That service went live in September. We have also developed national skills academies for construction on larger building sites to ensure appropriate training. I am afraid that, largely as a result of my having allowed interventions, I cannot address the fundamental points, particularly the one about allowing local authorities to build, which I would encourage and would like to see. However, the Government are pressing ahead with needed reforms to focus on the long term, despite the economic turbulence, and to condition the market and industry for growth. Our focus is now on stimulating market conditions, seeking new ways to deliver the housing that this country urgently needs and ensuring that a planning framework is in place to support a rapid market recovery when recovery comes. We must focus on the long term while addressing the short-term turbulence that we face.",50153,[],Housing,0,43,housing,416

2009-06-09,Housing,256,Grant Shapps,Con,False,"I beg to move, That this House expresses disappointment at the minimal take-up of the Government's Homeowner Mortgage Support Scheme, Mortgage Rescue Scheme, many of the Homebuy schemes, and the facility for zero stamp duty for zero carbon homes; notes that the Government's planning guidance on housing has led to a glut of flats, the destruction of gardens and a shortage of family homes; asserts that the lowest level of housebuilding since World War II exposes the failures of the Government's top-down and undemocratic regional planning process; believes that the Government's Home Information Packs have harmed the housing market further during the recession; regrets the Government's failure to publish a Housing Reform Green Paper; and registers disappointment at the rapid and regular change in housing ministers leading to the appointment of a fourth Housing Minister in less than 18 months. I offer a warm welcome to the new Minister for Housing as he takes up his post. I know that his background and experience will be an asset to this important Department. He actually becomes the ninth Housing Minister since this Government came to power. He is the fourth that I have faced across the Dispatch Box in the last two years and the third in the last nine months. I therefore hope that he enjoys better security of tenure than his three immediate predecessors, who lasted 211 days, 254 days and 246 days respectively. I would not want to bet my house, however, on the right hon. Gentleman lasting beyond the next election. I would like to offer the Minister a piece of advice; I encourage him to look at the recently produced Conservative green paper on housing, which puts forward a number of ideas that the Government could adopt immediately for their own housing programme, although it seems to have caused a little confusion with the right hon. Gentleman's immediate predecessor, who seems to have taken our â€œright to moveâ€ policy a little too literally. I know that the right hon. Gentleman sat around the Cabinet table for the first time this morning. He may have harboured concerns that it was his rugged good looks that had won him a seat around the Cabinet table, but I am absolutely confident that he is there for much more than window dressing and that he will do a fine job. I wish him every success. Let us start this evening's debate by thinking about those people who are lucky enough to own their own homes, but who are desperately trying to keep them by paying their mortgages. The Prime Minister likes to stand regularly at the Dispatch Box and claim that he is offering â€œReal help nowâ€ through the home owners mortgage support scheme, intended to allow people to postpone paying interest on their mortgages for up to two years. It was announced on 3 December, but not launched until 21 April, with an estimated 17,000 people repossessed during that period of delay. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how many households have so far received help under that scheme. The Chancellor called the new scheme real help for home owners at risk of repossession, but it is not even available to many home owners. When first announced, the then Housing Minister claimed it would cover some 70 per cent. of the mortgage market. She said that she wanted to see â€œall lendersâ€ signed up to the scheme, but the reality is that fewer than half of mortgage lenders are signed up to the scheme, with some estimates suggesting it may not be much more than a quarter. Since the former Minister for Housing claimed she wanted to see them all signed up, can the present Minister for Housing tell us when he thinks that might eventually happen? When the scheme finally launched on 21 April, the then Minister also said that six other lenders would shortly join the scheme. She described that as happening â€œas soon as possibleâ€, but the new Minister was kind enough to reply to a parliamentary question just yesterday, saying that only one additional mortgage lender had so far joined the scheme. Will he tell us when the other five are going to join it? If the home owners mortgage support scheme has not worked, how about the mortgage rescue scheme? Now this is a scheme that invites registered social landlords to buy up equity in the homes of anybody struggling to pay their mortgage. It was announced on 3 September, but not launched until 16 January. This was a two-year, Â£285 million scheme designed to help 6,000 of the â€œmost vulnerable familiesâ€ to avoid repossession. Four months into the two years, instead of anything like 6,000, just two families have been rescued. Perhaps the Minister will therefore confirm that on the current trend, only 12 families will be helped by this scheme over the two-year period. I understand that that is despite more than 4,000 home owners approaching their local authorities for help and an estimated 31,000 homes repossessed since the time the scheme was launched.",51637,[],Housing,0,2,housing,842

Indeed, I think that while I have been in my present position, there have been three or four Liberal Democrat housing spokesmen, as well as the same number of Housing Ministers. The Government's response to the issue of unaffordability has been to offer a plethora of new so-called homebuy schemes. One of them, the social homebuy scheme, is nothing if not confusing, conflicting and often contradictory in terms of itself and other schemes. It offered 15,000 families, supposedly by this point, the ability to buy part equity in their own social rented housing. Well, at this point, a mere 306 families have benefited from the scheme. Another scheme, another headline, and more disappointment for hard-pressed families out there. What about the Home Buy Direct scheme? I hope that the House is keeping up with the many different homebuy schemes. Home Buy Direct was a flagship Â£480 million scheme, announced on 3 September and intended to help key workers and those on modest incomes to buy new homes from developers. The Minister told us that 18,000 affordable homes would be sold in that way. However, we had to wait until the end of April- 233 days, which is time enough for a Housing Minister to come and go-for any sales to proceed. I should be interested to hear what the uptake has been so far. MyChoice Home Buy was yet another homebuy scheme. I know that the former Housing Minister used to be confused by these schemes; I wish the current Minister luck in getting his head around them more quickly. MyChoice Home Buy was one of two very similar schemes. Both involved key workers-first-time buyers-owning a share in homes on the open market, and buying them with housing association help. However, MyChoice Home Buy ran out of money just one month after the beginning of the financial year, leaving thousands of applicants stranded. In the course of his work as a constituency Member of Parliament, the new Minister may have received e-mails such as the one that I received from my constituents Derek and Ellen, who wrote to me about their experience of MyChoice Home Buy. Both are key workers. They work for the NHS, and have young children. They were delighted, they say, when the MyChoice Home Buy scheme was recommended to them, and were delighted to be accepted on to it. They started to get excited and to look around homes. They viewed a number of dream properties that they had previously imagined to be out of their reach. Then they were told that the scheme had run out of money.

Only today we have had further proof, from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, that the housing market is suffering as a result of expensive and bureaucratic HIPs. According to RICS, new evidence released today suggests that HIPs are distorting the market, which is leading to fewer new instructions to estate agents at a time when people are struggling to buy homes.

I hope that he will take the advice not just of the Opposition Front Bench, but of organisations such as RICS and many others which say that HIPs are completely and utterly useless. If the Minister is in the mood to do something for people, he should note that almost all first-time buyers-nine out of 10-could be exempted from stamp duty. That is another policy that he is welcome to borrow from us. He may know-if he does not, he will get his head around it very quickly-that, in a past Budget, the present Prime Minister said that zero-carbon homes would be allowed zero stamp duty. We asked, out of interest, how often that had come to pass. There had been a fair amount of time for the arrangement to bed in, and one would have thought that there would be a fair amount of stamp duty exemption. The answer was that only 18 homes had benefited, and that Â£70,000 of stamp duty relief had been granted.

The more it does not work, the more the Government think the way to make it work is to push harder and blame the people on the ground. They misunderstand the reasons why it is not working. People do not want building to be imposed on them; instead, they want to be part of the process of building their own communities.

There are good reasons why these policies are failing. We have talked about the failure of regional planning and the inability to understand that people on the ground best know what is required to house people in their local areas. The green paper that I have referenced addresses ideas to bring in local housing trusts, which would enable local people to decide how and where that housing goes, and also to deliver their own planning permission to go ahead and create those new communities. That would do a great deal to bring forward new housing in this country, and it would do so much more quickly than setting up massive bureaucracies that are unpopular and not democratically elected. Let me now turn to a single example in my constituency, where this Government say that between 10,000 and 15,000 homes need to be built. We are not worried about the building of new homes; I happen to represent a couple of new towns and we are very comfortable with the idea of house building. The problem is that it is not right to stuff in 10,000 or 15,000 homes while closing the local hospital at the same time.

The obsession with targeting, numbers, sub-numbers and sub-targets is not solving the problem; in fact, it has made it much more acute. The people I meet when I visit homelessness shelters do not say to me that the problem is that the target for affordable home building is not great enough. They say that the problem is that not enough homes are built, and the people who run those organisations say the problem is that there is nowhere to move people.

It is getting ridiculous to be constantly lectured on how policies involving targeting, top-down Government initiatives and headline-grabbing news could possibly be the solution when the Government have failed to solve any of the problems for more than a decade. We need a new approach and a fresh start, and we need to find ways to ensure that housing actually gets built in this country to an extent that is commensurate with what people require in local communities. We also need to solve some of our long-term housing problems, such as the so-called tenant tax. That is the confusing housing revenue account-or, rather, negative housing revenue account. It is a system whereby 140 of the councils that have their own stock or arm's length management organisations are paying into the pot and just 40 are getting something out of that pot. What happens to the rest of the money? It is sent to the Treasury, which keeps it. The sums involved are Â£200 million this year, projected to rise to Â£300 million next year. I know that many Labour Members who are interested in this subject recognise that that is a real problem. It is a tax on people who can least afford to pay it. As the Conservative who represents the most council tenants, I can tell the House that they look very poorly on the fact that up to 50 per cent. of the rent they have to pay goes out of the area. The money does not fix the homes in my constituency or help to build new homes, but is instead sent to the Government centrally. That is not a sensible way of going about housing policy and it is not helping anyone; it is taxing the poorest people through a tenants' tax. It is completely unfair and the Government admit that it is a problem. They have put it into one of their lengthy reviews. Can the Minister tell us when the review will finally report?

That is part of the advantage of looking to local authorities to do more, in precisely the way that I want to see, as does the Prime Minister. I shall now say something about our response during the past 12 months. We have aimed to act swiftly to support those most affected by the downturn-first of all, people and families at risk of repossession, and of losing the very thing that is at the centre of the stability of their life: their home. We have acted to try to help those with particular problems in the housing market, including first-time buyers. We have also acted to try to support the construction industry, as well as to maintain the supply of new homes. At the same time, we have tried to pursue the longer term goals of increasing the supply of new homes, especially for low-cost rent or purchase. We have also looked to raise the quality, in both design and environmental terms, of homes, as well as to reinforce the rights of tenants. Our approach to the recession and those at risk of losing their homes can be characterised in two ways. The first is an attempt to put in place universal support available to all, whatever their circumstances. The support for mortgage interest scheme helps more than 200,000 households through the benefit system. We acted in January to change the rules so that more people could get more help more quickly through that scheme. That is why the Council of Mortgage Lenders, in its evidence to the Select Committee, said that theâ€œreduction in the period for claiming income support mortgage interest was a pretty fundamental change... it has been of very significant assistance.â€",51637,[],Housing,0,63,housing,367

We have tried to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes the Tories did in the 1990s. Moreover, we have fundamentally different values, and a different view of the role of Government when people are struggling and the economy is in recession. That is why we have acted where we can to try to help people stay in their own homes. We have acted to try to help firms stay in business. We have acted to try to help people stay in work. That is the fundamental duty of a Labour Government when people are in trouble. The universal support that we have tried to put in place for all families and households irrespective of means and circumstances includes free access to advice desks in courts across the country. That is an important part of the help that has been made available. It also includes the negotiation of a comprehensive range of support from lenders through the home owners mortgage support scheme, which has ensured that lenders view repossession as a last resort, rather than moving faster to try to repossess. The motion mentions the special schemes for people in specific circumstances. For example, more than 130 vulnerable households have so far benefited under the mortgage rescue scheme. It does not necessarily entail a simple buy-back of those homes; it can mean-as it has done in many cases- a freeze in the repossession actions by lenders. The scheme is not simply about stepping in to take over the ownership and equity for people who cannot pay the mortgage at all. Local authorities report to us that as a result of the scheme, more than 4,000 households that have been struggling with their mortgages have received free advice from their local authority. The measures are designed to be more than the sum of their parts. The combination of mortgage advice, intervention in the courts and lenders viewing repossession as a last resort means that in the first quarter of this year-a time when many would expect repossessions to rise-we have seen a 40 per cent. fall in applications to the courts by lenders to take possession of people's homes. The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield said that repossessions were at a record high. Repossessions were at a record high in the early 1990s. They were at a record high of more than 75,000 in 1991, when one in 12 households were in arrears and 1.5 million people were in negative equity. The combination of the action we have taken to try to help people stay in their homes means that at the very point at which one might expect the number of repossessions to go through the roof, as it did in previous recessions, only 12,800 were reported in the first quarter of this year. The result is that the director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders said last month that his forecast of repossession numbers this year now looks pessimistic, and he expects to revise it. That revision is a direct result of the action that we have taken, in combination with lower interest rates and other actions that we have taken on the economy. We know that first-time buyers have been hard hit by a lack of credit, with lenders in some cases requiring deposits of up to 40 per cent. So despite falling house prices, they are unable to get on to the property ladder. The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) mentioned home information packs, but it is the lack of access to credit that is the fundamental cause of stagnation in the housing market. There is no evidence to suggest that home information packs have added to the difficulties. On the contrary, a survey by Connells estate agents showed that sales with HIPs get to exchange six days earlier. ICM has highlighted the fact that more than eight out of 10 first time buyers in particular want more information, and HIPs are part of the answer. The hon. Gentleman invited me to look at his green paper on housing and stronger foundations. I have done so, and I was struck by several aspects of it, not least the introduction by the Leader of the Opposition.

He published a paper in which he called forâ€œtearing down the Berlin Wall of varying tenure and rent levels that operates between the private rented and social rented sectorsâ€.

It is a great frustration for me to debate yet another Conservative motion that has nothing positive to say. The Conservative analysis of Government failures in housing seems largely correct: it is certainly true that the Government's mortgage support scheme has so far helped just two people, that the facility for zero stamp duty for zero-carbon homes has helped just 18, that Government policies are leading to woefully inadequate numbers of homes being built, and that almost all of them are small flats.

I also agree with him about community land trusts, which he and I have debated in Westminster Hall. The trusts are very important in Cornwall and many other rural areas, and they may even represent a policy on which we can achieve all-party agreement. I said that the Conservative motion was vacuous, but the Government amendment reminds me a little of the string quartet that kept playing as the Titanic sank. There is no acceptance of what is happening in the real world: the Government hunker down and comfort themselves by reeling off a list of statistics while closing their ears to the desperate cries of those who have lost their homes, who live in cramped and unacceptable homes or who have no hope whatsoever of getting even that. Some 1.8 million families are languishing on council lists waiting for a suitable home that they can afford to rent. In London, around one household in 10 is waiting to be rehoused. In my constituency, the figure is even higher, with one household in five stuck on the waiting list for a council or housing association property. Earlier, the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. Mac Shane) mentioned the link with the British National party, and I think that he is right. Some of the areas worst affected in terms of housing are in the old Labour heartlands. The very people who elected this Government are the ones most let down on the issue of housing. Housing is a powder-keg issue. It ignites rows about race and immigration, and it provokes people to lose faith in the system. It is the very issue that fascist parties rely on to breed resentment and hate. The Leader of the House is correct to say that the Government should take responsibility for the rise of the BNP, and I completely agree. However, if there is to be any hope of tackling that sort of fascist politics, housing is where the Government have to start. What is needed is a serious investment in affordable housing to rent. The Government invested Â£12.5 billion in a VAT cut that made little or no difference to people's lives, when they could have spent that on building tens of thousands of more homes for people to live in. The Government also need to accept that the old cross-subsidy model of house building is not going to build any new homes in the short term. They need to scrap Treasury targets on the number of units per unit of subsidy so that housing associations have the confidence to know that they can use the money available to build without facing penalties later. It is ridiculous that at the very time in a recession that we need house building to increase, building has been grinding to a halt. So much for the fiscal stimulus. By the time we get out of the recession, housing need will be greater, house prices will again spiral out of control, and we will not be able to do anything about it because the builders will all have retrained or gone back to Poland. We will have nothing with which to tackle the problem. The Government have a real opportunity to improve housing now. Major investment now could absolve them of the sins of the past 10 years. I hope they will realise that they have an opportunity now and a clear way to make amends. I was pleased to hear the new Minister say how important he thinks it is that councils should be able to build homes. Councils are desperate to be able to build new homes for families in their area. They have to pick up the pieces when homeless families land on their doorstep, but they have only limited powers to fix the problem. The Prime Minister made warm noises about that several months ago, but the proposals that were put forward were thin on the ground. The Minister was not sure how to answer the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) on how many new homes would be built with the new money available. We calculated that it would be about 900 homes. That is two or three for every local authority area, which will make only a tiny dent in the number of 1.8 million people on housing waiting lists. If councils are to be able to borrow to build, they need to know what their asset base and their rental income will be. Taking new homes alone out of the housing revenue account is not enough. We must have fundamental reform of the housing revenue account system now. I am pleased to hear from the Minister that it will conclude soon, but we have heard that for a very long time. Every time there is a change of Housing Minister, it gets further delayed. I was pleased to hear the Conservative spokesperson join our campaign to end the tenant tax, but I was left a little unclear about what the Conservatives' proposals would be. The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) stated the position well for me. In my constituency, Brent, we receive a subsidy from poor tenants in Cambridge. It is invidious for poor tenants in Cambridge to be subsidising poor tenants' repairs in Brent, and a solution is needed. Our solution is that that should be topped up out of general taxation. People like me, who can afford to pay out of their taxes, should pay for that, but the Conservatives have no proposal at all, which means that there will be no money for repairs in places like my constituency.",51637,[],Housing,0,103,housing,971
2009-06-09,Housing,358,Robert Syms,Con,False,"The hon. Lady makes a good point. For all political parties, need has always been the basis of housing. If there is a debate about whether some areas should have resources and some should not, there has to be some kind of compromise. General taxation is one way of doing it, but at present the negative subsidy is rising so fast that in five years most councils will not have council housing stock, because of what is happening to the financial system.",51637,[],Housing,0,104,housing,82
2009-06-09,Housing,359,Sarah Teather,LibDem,False,"I entirely agree that we must end the system of negative subsidy. It is ridiculous. Councils cannot plan because they do not know what money they will have from one year to the next. They need to know that their rental income is available to reinvest in their housing stock for repairs or for building, and so that they have something against which they can borrow, knowing what their future revenue stream will be. The Treasury currently keeps about Â£200 million of the money coming in from rental income, so it is not as though all of it is going to repair houses in other parts of the country. It is unacceptable for the Chancellor to keep a portion of that rent. The second thing that the new Minister should do urgently is to give councils back their right-to-buy receipts. Only then can councils replace the homes lost through right to buy, to make sure that future generations have a chance of somewhere to live. Since 1980, 2.5 million council properties have been purchased under right to buy from a council stock that then stood at 5 million. It is no wonder that councils have nowhere for people to live. Taken together, new money, investment of rental and right-to-buy income, and extension of powers to borrow would make a real difference to councils' ability to build homes that people need. But in the Conservative motion and in their green paper, they have no plans to do that. They have plans to review the HRA system and to end the tenant tax, but no plans to top up finance that is lacking for repairs. They have no plans to invest more money in social homes and no plans to give councils back money from right to buy, so I cannot see how they can deliver on their promise to build more council homes.",51637,[],Housing,0,105,housing,312

In addition to building new homes, it is important that we make a more concerted effort to bring empty properties back into use. The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) made a point about MOD housing-a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester has made many times in the Chamber. It is an excellent point, but we need to be willing to think flexibly also about empty commercial space during a recession, and to be prepared to offer short-life housing to people who want it. The single most important thing that the Government could do to help to bring empty properties back into use is to make renovating them cheaper. They should cut VAT on renovation, rebuild and then make grant available to housing associations to repair the empty properties that they buy, because at the moment they cannot use Homes and Communities Agency money to do so. The Government should also offer grants and loans to individuals to repair properties in return for lets to social housing tenants. All those things would make a difference. The Conservatives' key policy for tackling empty properties is to reduce the space and design standard for social homes, and I wonder whether they have any idea how long the average social tenant spends in temporary accommodation.

However, I shall give some credit where credit is due, because the Government have done some welcome things, particularly on the changes to income support for mortgage interest. When we add up all the different schemes, however, we still have the problem whereby tens of thousands of people fall through the net and face having their home repossessed.

It takes a long time before someone is approved or found not to be eligible to claim help, and, in the meantime, they can get into great difficulty. The Government introduced a pre-action protocol that I thought contained many useful things. I agreed with all the protocol's sentiments, which we called for before the Government published it, but the problem is that it has no teeth, and I cannot understand why the Government are not prepared to reform mortgage law to give it teeth. If we were to reform mortgage law, we could give the courts the power to intervene to enforce some of the good things that are in the pre-action protocol. We would also be able to deal with the situation when a landlord's home is repossessed and the people who rent it get no notice at all, except when they go home and find that the locks have been changed. We can deal with much of that simply by giving the courts the power to intervene and then to put the rest into guidance, as the Government have done.

She lives in a two-bedroom flat with her four children and bids regularly on the choice-based letting system. However, the highest that she has ever been ranked is 140th out of 300, and she has no hope whatever of moving.

2009-06-09,Housing,378,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"I, too, should like to welcome the Minister for Housing to that most important post. About three quarters of householders in this country are home owners. For most of those people, most of the time, being a home owner has been a happy and successful experience. It has benefited them and their families enormously. Obviously, the majority of people still aspire to be home owners. However, people in many of those families are experiencing real pain because of a combination of factors, including lack of affordability and changes in their circumstances; in some cases they will have lost their job. That leaves many families genuinely worried, and they are sometimes at risk of losing their homes. That rightly causes concern to all of us. My right hon. Friend has already recognised that in the early 1990s the level of repossessions, with all the pain that repossessions put families through, was at least as high as it is now; in some cases it was higher. However, that should not stop us focusing a great deal of attention and support on those families. It is absolutely critical that we do everything that we can to reduce repossessions and to help people through a difficult time. On looking at mortgage law, I agree with the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) that we should in some cases do more to enforce controls against lenders who are excessively zealous in the action that they are taking. One particular group of people about whom we need to worry are tenants in buy-to-let properties. In some instances, we should also worry about unauthorised tenants in properties in cases in which the mortgage holder has defaulted. Such tenants have virtually no protection and are at risk of being thrown out, sometimes with no notice whatever. In many cases, they then become the responsibility of the local authority. I know that the Government are considering the issue; it is important that they look at it closely and act swiftly. For a host of reasons-for the sake of the people involved, and because of the pressures on local authorities-we need to do what we can to support those individuals.",51637,[],Housing,0,124,housing,361

There is no question but that there are large numbers of vulnerable households in such properties, whom we may need to act swiftly to assist. Before I move on to the core of what I want to talk about, may I take the opportunity to raise with the Minister an issue that I have raised many times with his predecessors? It is the plight of local authority leaseholders-people who own ex-local authority stock, having bought it, sometimes through the right to buy, but more frequently through resale. In some cases-I am thinking of my constituents-as an unintended consequence of a desirable objective, namely the decent homes initiative, they face major works bills of Â£60,000. Some groups of such leaseholders enjoy various concessions when it comes to that repayment. In particular, those who are retired are able to put a charge on their property for sale. However, many younger, working households have not so far been able to avail themselves of a scheme that gives them any realistic opportunity of being able to repay without losing their home. I am seriously worried about that group of people, and I urge the Government to swallow the resistance-a resistance that is also rooted in my local authority, Westminster, so it is cross-party-to providing practical support for those households. Some of them will lose their homes when those bills fall due, and they do not have the money to pay them.",51637,[],Housing,0,126,housing,277

2009-06-09,Housing,382,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"There is an important point in my hon. Friend's comment. Generally speaking, what he has mentioned was not a problem among local authority leaseholders, although it depended a little on where they were. The leaseholders causing me the greatest concern were those who held leases in high rises; it is extremely expensive to carry out decent homes initiative work on high rises. Many other leaseholders, however, were perfectly able to sustain a mortgage on ex-local authority stock in normal times. However, there is a genuine issue. Last week in my advice surgery, I met yet again a woman on housing benefit, who-extraordinarily-was allowed to buy her local authority property from Westminster council. I do not understand how anybody could have been complicit in allowing and encouraging people on very low incomes-sometimes benefit-level incomes-to buy their own homes. It is also fair to say that the roots of much of the global economic catastrophe with which we are now dealing lie in the American sub-prime mortgage market, in which people who simply had no realistic means of repaying home loans were encouraged to buy. We all have to be careful, however; the issue is not confined to America and it is not just a party political point. We have an understandable desire to support and encourage people into home ownership, but there are people on the margins who should not have been so encouraged. That brings me to my core point, which has been mentioned in this debate. I am thinking of the 4 million social tenants and the 4 million or so people-who overlap with the former to some extent-who are in a queue for social housing. Fundamentally, the big dividing line in housing policy is now between those of us who believe that social housing is part of the solution and those who believe that it is part of the problem. I say in all fairness that the Government have not built enough social homes; I have never believed that they have, and I am on record as having said that. I am concerned about meeting housing need, and I cannot deny that that is true. However, it is also true, although ignored on the Opposition Benches, that the money that we have invested in social housing has been much needed investment in the decent homes initiative. We have rehabilitated and refurbished tens of thousands of homes in my constituency that were long overdue. The investment was made, although I would have preferred it to have been slightly more balanced towards new homes.",51637,[],Housing,0,128,housing,424

2009-06-09,Housing,384,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend always manages to trump me when it comes to Hammersmith Conservatives; what is going on in that borough is jaw-dropping. He is absolutely right. Sometimes it seems to me that Hammersmith Conservatives make Dame Shirley Porter look like Octavia Hill. My hon. Friend will, no doubt, continue to fight that battle. I return to the issue of the dividing line on social housing. The message coming through extremely strongly from the practice in Hammersmith, from the statements made by Westminster council's deputy cabinet member for housing and from many Conservative think-tanks and supporting politicians is that social housing is the fundamental problem. Even the Leader of the Opposition's introduction to Conservative housing policy talks about families being trapped in social housing. The language repeated again and again in such texts implies that tenants are second-class citizens. It equates social housing with deprivation and loss of status. The implication is that tenants should be ashamed. I deplore that, because social housing should be a choice and tenure is not a matter of morality. People in social housing may not be there for life. Obviously, with home ownership being so desirable because of the equity return over the years, many people want to leave their social housing at some point, when they can do so, and enjoy the benefits of home ownership. However, when and while they are tenants, they are not in some way morally inferior because of the exercise of that choice. The thrust of the argument emerging from the Conservatives is focused on security of tenure. Tenants everywhere should be very worried about that emerging thinking because, as is well researched and documented, the loss of security of tenure has a devastating effect on communities and on the lives of the people it affects. There is a litany of policy in Conservative thinking that would do untold damage to neighbourhoods and families. It would also lead to additional expenditure being incurred by the public purse, particularly through housing benefit when tenants, whether in social housing or forced into the private sector, have to pay higher rents that must be picked up elsewhere by the public purse.",51637,[],Housing,0,130,housing,360

The abandonment of targets and the lack of acknowledgement of the need for social housing, as reflected in the motion, would mean that those people continued to be treated and regarded as second-class citizens, and that their housing needs would not be met.

2009-06-09,Housing,388,Andrew Lansley,Con,False,"I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute briefly to this important debate. I particularly enjoyed hearing the opening speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps). There is nothing that I wish to add to or detract from his critique of Government policy and his exposition of our policies. My purpose is simply to add some remarks relating specifically to South Cambridgeshire and the application of Government housing policy even in the months still available to them. Much needs to be done by the Government to offset the difficulties that we face in meeting our future housing need. The Minister will be aware that South Cambridgeshire is one of those places where housing need is the most acute, as are the problems of affordability and the house price to earnings ratio. In Cambridgeshire we have never taken the view that we wish to constrain the availability of additional housing supply; we have always actively sought opportunities to match new housing supply to the evident requirement for employment and new housing in our area. That is why, five or six years ago, we identified additional housing requirements through the county structure plan. In my constituency, we have given up a great deal of green belt. New developments are happening in Cambourne and in Trumpington Meadows. Through the structure plan, we are committed to the development of Northstowe as a new town of more than 9,500 homes. We have always advocated that. We recognised, after an exhaustive process through the structure plan, that that location was the right place for us to take the next step towards supplying a substantial number of new houses as part of a large increase overall. In my constituency, even on our existing plans, we intended to double the rate of new housing in the next few years. It will be no surprise to hon. Members that, in the fourth quarter of last year, much of the impetus simply stopped. It is vital to regain some of that initiative. The Government can do several things to help increase housing supply and provide more affordable and social housing in South Cambridgeshire. Like others, I have witnessed the number of people seeking social housing more than double during my time as a Member of Parliament. Some of my hon. Friends have already made the point, so I will not go on about it, that in South Cambridgeshire and Cambridge city, more than Â£11 million disappears in negative subsidy on the housing revenue account-something approaching 40 per cent. of the rental income in South Cambridgeshire. By the measure of housing need, which is the starting point for negative subsidy, we clearly have dramatically rising needs. We also need social housing and I therefore urge Ministers to act quickly to enable us in South Cambridgeshire and in Cambridge city to respond to the dramatic housing need by retaining more resources to improve our existing housing stock and add to it. Secondly, let me consider Northstowe. The new Minister for Housing told us nothing about the Government's plans for eco-towns in South Cambridgeshire. Despite all our efforts to offer additional sites for major new developments, the Government wanted to wish an eco-town upon us. We said that it was in the wrong place, there was no infrastructure to support it and that it was environmentally unsustainable. The Government wanted to go ahead, we fought and, in the space of several months last year, we defeated the proposal. It went away and I hope that it does not come back. We in Cambridgeshire will decide where best to support new housing supply. However, I stress to Ministers that, during the discussion last year with the Minister's predecessor but one, we made it clear that we wanted Northstowe in my constituency to be the first eco-town. In July 2007, just after the Prime Minister took office, one of his first proposals, which he set out in The Sunday Times, was to build eco-towns. The example that he gave was described as â€œOakington in Cambridgeshire.â€ Oakington, which is in my constituency, is the location of the planned new town of Northstowe. We want it to be an eco-town, an exemplar and the first new town of its kind in this country. We want it to go ahead, but that will not happen at the moment. Gallagher, the developer, has backed out and the proposal depends on the Homes and Communities Agency, with Government backing, being prepared to turn it into the first exemplary eco-town. I urge Ministers who are taking on their new responsibilities to consider positively how we can make Northstowe the first eco-town. If we are to take a rational approach to providing additional housing, the Government must remove from the regional spatial strategy in the east of England the specification that the housing targets are â€œa minimumâ€. If we carry on as we are, with little new housing being built, opportunistic developers will try to claim that, because we are not on track to meet the housing target in the regional spatial strategy, they can make highly speculative proposals for new house building in highly unsuitable locations at some unspecified time in the future. We will end up with an enormous overhang of designations for new housing in the wrong places, whereas local authorities should decide, with local people's support, where that new housing should be built, with the necessary infrastructure support. I urge Ministers to reject that misuse of language in the regional spatial strategy, which drives that bad effect.",51637,[],Housing,0,134,housing,924
2009-06-09,Housing,389,Phyllis Starkey,Lab,False,"It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), who made a thoughtful contribution and some points that deserve consideration. It was very different from the contribution from the Conservative Front Bench. I agree with the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), who has now left, that that was vacuous. Indeed, in my view parts of it were positively dangerous. I want to focus on a couple of the points in the Conservative motion, because it is important that we rebut them. First, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) spoke from the Front Bench about the take-up of the mortgage support scheme and the mortgage rescue scheme, as well as the homebuy schemes. His comments were essentially debating points and party political point scoring, and did not give a realistic assessment of the reality of the situation. I would point the hon. Gentleman to the interesting evidence that the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government heard from the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association. They said that it was far too soon to judge the success or otherwise of the two schemes to support people facing repossession, because of the time that it takes for people to get through to the end point. The famous two households at the end of the MRS involved individuals whose houses have been bought by a council or a housing association. The CML and the IMLA both made the point that those schemes are actually about preventing repossession. Much of the benefit achieved by both schemes, including the one that was introduced as recently as April, has been in encouraging those who are experiencing difficulties to approach their lenders straight away. Regrettably, in the past, people having difficulty with their mortgages tended to put their heads in the sand and hope that the problem would go away. They would build up huge arrears and at that point there would be repossessions. The evidence from both of the current schemes is that many people are going to their lenders first and that lenders are exercising forbearance-although partly out of self-interest. Lenders have realised that it costs a lot for a mortgage company to repossess a property-about Â£35,000 to Â£37,000-and there is not a lot of point in doing that in the current circumstances, because they would not be able to sell the property and recoup any losses. Lenders have been persuaded, partly in their own self-interest and partly because of the pressures put on them by central Government, that they should exercise forbearance, come to an agreement with their borrowers and use all possible measures to maintain people in their homes, thereby avoiding reaching the end of the process and having to get the council or a housing association to buy a property. Simply to cite the figures for how many people reach the end of the process, as the hon. Gentleman did, is to make a debating point. It shows that he does not give two hoots about the individuals involved and does not want to have a constructive debate-and the same goes for his comments about the other mortgage scheme. I notice that the hon. Gentleman is closing his ears, obviously because this is uncomfortable to hear, which will be interesting for everybody out there-not those in the Public Gallery, because there are not many there now, but for everybody who reads Hansard tomorrow. They will realise that the Opposition spokesperson is now chatting to the person next to him, because he does not want to hear the debate-which, if I may say so, also demonstrates his contempt for Parliament, as there is little point in having a debate if people do not listen to the contributions of others. The second point in the Conservatives' motion, which nobody has even alluded to, is the ridiculous suggestion, which the Opposition constantly make, that it is the Government's planning guidance on housing that has led to a glut of flats. There are two reasons why there are so many flats in city centres. The first reason is that local councils have not used their planning powers properly and have allowed planning applications to go through. The second reason is that developers make more money if they pack lots of tiny flats on to a small site. Opposition spokespeople frequently suggest that the reason why there are so many flats is the Government's rules on increasing the density of housing. Actually, the density of flats in city centres is many times higher than that set out in the guidance on density provided by the Government. The reason why flats are being built is that developers want to make the maximum profit, and that is what flats give them. Previously, they were able to sell the flats and get their money back. Supine councils do not make proper use of the planning powers that they already have to draw up proper local development frameworks that would allow them to refuse planning applications in the first place. It is ridiculous for the Opposition constantly to blame the Government's density requirements and to pretend that local councils have no responsibility in the matter. That brings me to the points that an Opposition worth their salt should have been making today, because there are some things that the Government need to do more of in order to address the problems before us. The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who is obsessed with regulation, made the astonishing point that he could not understand why house prices were falling even though housing need still exceeded housing supply. That is happening because there is no mortgage money. House prices, regrettably, do not respond to people's need; they respond to people's ability to compete for a scarce resource, which bears almost no relation to people's need for housing. Regrettably, many people who need housing do not have the financial resources to express that need economically. In order to enable more people to gain access to the housing market, we need to free up mortgage finance. That is not within the gift of the Department for Communities and Local Government; it is within the gift of the Treasury. Some very reasonable complaints were raised in the Select Committee about the asset-backed securities guarantee scheme. I cannot go into the technicalities now, but I refer the Minister to the transcript of the evidence. Clearly, certain things need to be done to tinker with that scheme in order to get mortgage finance flowing more freely. That would help shared ownership and shared equity schemes, in particular, and enable people to express their housing need economically. The Government are taking certain steps to try to get the housing market moving again. Evidence was given to the Select Committee by the two lenders as well as by the National Housing Federation and the Home Builders Federation, representing the housing associations and the builders. All those groupings said that the Government were doing the right thing, but not enough of it, and that more money should be made available for the schemes. In relation to the asset-backed securities guarantee scheme in particular, they said that it was not just a question of more money, but that the Treasury should be prepared to take greater financial risks. I urge the Government to consider that idea. The major criticism that the Opposition have made of the Government's steps to cushion businesses and home owners from the effects of this recession is that we are spending too much money, that we have borrowed too much, and that we should be borrowing and spending less. That is at complete variance with what was said by all those who gave evidence to the Select Committee. They said that, if anything, the Government should be borrowing and spending more now in order to try to restart house building, to keep the construction industry going and to ensure that the people whom we represent, and care deeply about, can gain access to the housing that they need at a price that they can afford, either to buy or to rent. I therefore urge the Government to consider increasing their spending even more, because if we do not spend that money now, the cost that society will subsequently have to bear of the lost opportunity to keep the house building industry going will be immense, as will the cost to the people whom we represent, because more families will have to live for longer in unsatisfactory and overcrowded accommodation. Those costs will be borne by future generations.",51637,[],Housing,0,135,housing,1434
2009-06-09,Housing,390,Robert Syms,Con,False,"Housing is an important subject for many of our constituents, and I therefore welcome this opportunity to make a small contribution to the debate tonight. I have raised questions on a number of occasions about the housing revenue account and the negative subsidy. I do not pretend that there is an elegant or easy answer to this complex and difficult question, but many areas of the country are contributing substantial sums of money, which is having a big impact on rents and on the ability of housing authorities and arm's length management organisations to deliver a service. It is not necessarily coming from the leafier or more prosperous areas of the UK. There are areas such as Bolsover and Chesterfield-and even areas such as Barking and Dagenham in outer London-that have major housing problems, but are contributing to the pot. The Government need to come up with some kind of long-term solution, so that authorities contributing a lot of money can plan and perhaps provide some additional housing stock-or at least spend money on reducing the voids. More importantly, when I talked to the Poole housing partnership, I found that it welcomed the decent homes standard and the money spent on housing stock. It also said, however, that if it had to continue paying the massive sums of money levied, it might not be able to maintain the housing stock in the long term. It might then have to look at some alternative arrangement and become more like a housing association. That would be a pity, because its satisfaction rates are very high. It is empowering tenants, teaching them to do all sorts of things like use computers and helping them with advice on how to deal with debt. The relative income levels of council tenants in my Poole constituency are surprisingly low, so there is a real need, as house prices are very high and social housing is going to take a major part of the strain. As I said, there is no easy solution, but there is a problem. Many Government Back Benchers have realised that at the current rate of increase, it will not be many years before as much as Â£1 billion will be raised from tenants' rents and then redistributed to other areas. The Minister said earlier that he would soon come up with a solution; we certainly need one soon. My hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) referred to home information packs, which were debated in connection with the Housing Bill. When we raised the question of what happens with these packs, which are time limited, if people do not sell their homes, the Minister always assured us that everything would be swept up when the home was eventually sold-but if someone puts their house up for sale in the current housing market and it does not sell for a while, they might have to provide two or three packs, with attendant costs and consequences. An argument for HIPs might be made in a booming economy, but in a housing market that is extremely sticky and likely to remain so for a while, they are an additional burdensome cost for people trying to sell their homes. They have become an impediment, so if my party gains the confidence of the British people and forms the next Government, it will repeal the HIPs as an important element in the strategy for housing market recovery. I think that the Homes and Communities Agency is a welcome development. In the current economic situation, it will play a major and important role in kick-starting some developments that have fallen by the wayside. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) mentioned the agency in the context of Cambridgeshire. Clearly, the Government are doing some good things, but what they have done in other respects is surprising. If someone had asked me in 1997 how many social housing units I thought the Government would provide during their term in office, I would have said, â€œWell, this is a Labour Government, so they'll provide a lot of social housing.â€ I know that decent homes standards was their priority, but the reality is that the Government's record on building council housing and other forms of social housing has been remarkably poor. The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) often makes his point with a degree of force and common sense. The result is that fewer houses are available for those who need them. My hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) mentioned armed forces housing. I welcome the recent legislative change to allow members of the armed forces to count for something on housing lists. That is rather a good thing. The overall housing situation is one of great difficulty. I agree with the Minister that fewer people are currently losing their homes. Given that we have a crash market, many lenders are being sensitive and sensible in their dealings with people, but that is not because of Government policy. As we heard earlier, Government policy has not achieved an awful lot. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has always said that provided that people who are in trouble tell lenders honestly that they are in trouble, it may well be possible to work out a solution. I welcome that. As I said during the economic debate the other day, I am not very pessimistic about the long term. I am pessimistic about our levels of debt, but I am not pessimistic about the British economy. I think that it will grow next year. Given the amount of money that the Government have spent, the devaluation and the reduction in interest rates, it would be very surprising if things did not start to move. In the light of some of the initial figures that we are seeing, I think it legitimate to say that the position is stabilising, and will probably improve next year. I hope that that will cause the housing market to stabilise as well. One of the big differences between the situation today and the situation in the early 1990s is the substantial level of personal debt among households. We know that unemployment will rise, although we pray that it will not rise by too much. People who lose their jobs, who do not receive help with their mortgages for quite some time, and who have credit card debts and other loans, will very quickly find themselves in financial trouble. Finally, let me point out to the Minister that Dudley is one of the authorities that make a major contribution in the form of negative housing subsidy, and that that issue needs to be considered. We need a formula, which may have to be a compromise. Clearly funds cannot be taken out of central London overnight, but we need some way of getting through the current circumstances. We should ensure that authorities such as the Poole housing partnership can plan, maintain their independence and provide a good service, but we should also have a needs-based housing formula.",51637,[],Housing,0,136,housing,1174
2009-06-09,Housing,391,Jeremy Corbyn,Lab,False,"I welcome the debate, and congratulate both Ministers on their appointments. I look forward to hearing what the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin), has to say in response to the debate. I have the privilege of representing an inner-city community where housing is an enormous issue. Only 30 per cent. of my constituents are owner-occupiers; the rest occupy council, housing association or privately rented properties. The levels of deprivation and overcrowding are extremely serious. I compliment the Government on the amount of money they have given us to establish decent homes standards, improvements in community areas on estates and better estate management-that has been a huge step forward and a welcome development-but there are still many people on the housing waiting list, many who cannot even get on to the housing waiting list, and many on the internal transfer list. The knock-on effects of overcrowding in producing poor health, under-achievement in education and all the other social breakdown issues are often directly related to housing. We all know of families who are experiencing hard times because of overcrowding, but when such families are given decent houses or flats, everything suddenly starts to look a great deal better. I believe that we-Government and local authorities-must do everything possible to improve the housing situation. In London as a whole, 200,000 families are living in overcrowded accommodation and 50,000 are living in temporary accommodation. Those figures are horrendous by any stretch of the imagination. The position can be dealt with only through a combination of policies, including a large amount of public investment in housing for people in desperate need. While I understand why the Government are so sensitive about the issues of home ownership and mortgages, I feel that, since the 1950s, the country has developed an obsession with home ownership, often at the expense of social rented accommodation. There is an obsessive belief that everyone should aspire to home ownership, while council housing is seen as the housing of last resort. I should love to see people being given a genuine choice between renting and buying, with no social stigma attached to not owning a home. No other country in Europe has become involved in home ownership to the same degree, and no other country in Europe has the same levels of excessive personal debt-largely because of home ownership, or because of the ability to borrow against what were perceived to be permanently rising house values and all the problems that accompanied that. I believe that we should take a rain check, and think it all through a bit more. Both the Minister and the Conservative Front Bencher are new to their posts so I am sure they will find it difficult to answer all the points raised, but I would be grateful if they tried to deal with some of them. The latest Government statement on house spending includes the allocation of Â£100 million for new council development. That is very good news, but it will not build many homes. Although Â£100 million might sound like a lot of money, council places in London cost about Â£100,000 per unit to develop. That allocation is a very good start, but we have to go a lot further, and a lot faster. We must also recognise that one problem is that, because of the Tory Government's policies in the 1980s of pushing sales of council properties and compulsory competitive tendering for council services, local authorities currently do not have enough skilled architects, planners and all the other expertise required to develop a housing programme, as that has either been sold off or gone away. Over the past few years in London, it has generally been housing associations that have developed new housing-that is also the case in most other parts of the country. The Minister needs to look at a number of issues in this regard, such as the relationship between housing associations and the Homes and Communities Agency, and the possibility of zoning them because there are some highly inefficient housing associations with large numbers of properties scattered over a huge area and the on-costs of managing them are very high. The housing associations are aware of that, and some of them are undertaking sensible transfers to bring about more efficient management. We also need to look at the democratic running of housing associations, because there is a degree of accountability for council tenants and leaseholders as they can get hold of a councillor or council official, but I do not find the same degree of accountability in some housing associations. Some are exemplary, but others are truly awful in their management methods and their tenants' representation methods, and we need to be tougher with them. They are not private companies; they are handling very large sums of public money and dealing with housing applicants who are nominated to them by local housing authorities. I started my contribution by pointing out that in my constituency, as in most in London, the fastest growing sector is the private rented sector. In an intervention on the Minister I made the point that my local authority, like many others, now routinely nominates people to the private rented sector because there are no council or housing association places for those in desperate housing need. The rent deposit is paid by the local authority, and housing benefit pays for the rent; and the rent levels are astronomical. I could give many examples of flats in the same council block where, for example, one is council-owned and is paid for by housing benefit of Â£100 a week and the other has been bought under the right to buy and then rented out on the private market at Â£300 a week, which is also paid for by housing benefit. The amount of public money we are pouring into the pockets of private landlords is ludicrous; the total is several billions per year in London. The total housing benefit bill in London is about Â£4 billion; I do not know the exact breakdown between the public and private sectors, but I am sure the unit cost of private rented accommodation is much higher. In the short term, there is not a lot we can do about that, as the private rented sector is providing housing for people, but rent controls in the private sector would prevent profiteering. Above all, we should provide far more places built to a decent standard, because I am shocked and appalled by the conditions of the private rented accommodation in which many people are placed at present. Members' work at our advice surgeries has made us all armchair experts on housing allocation policies. People come to us and say, â€œI'd like to get a house as we're a bit overcrowded.â€ I look up and ask, â€œAny illness in the family?â€ They reply, â€œNot muchâ€, so I say, â€œHow much? What's wrong with you?â€ When they tell me, I say, â€œYes, that sounds bad.â€ We go through the whole process, and then I might think that they will get a few more medical, overcrowding or sharing points. There is an entire science involved. I wish that that science did not exist; I wish it was not necessary. Within that science, we endlessly change what the priorities are, and two groups of people, at opposite ends of the scale, lose out. First, most local authorities have long since ceased to house single people unless they are either very vulnerable or desperately ill. There are many very aggrieved single people in their 20s and 30s who have chosen to lead a single life-that is their lifestyle choice-but have no chance of getting local authority housing. They have no chance of buying because their salaries are not high enough and they even find it difficult to go into shared ownership. We need to examine the lifestyle choices that people are making and start to reflect them a bit more. Let us move to the other end of the scale. The building programmes of local authorities, housing associations and private sector developers are all ignoring large families-they do exist. We need family-sized housing to be constructed as part of the entire development programme. Lastly, the Minister has doubtless been made aware of and fully understands all the issues associated with council housing and its finance. He has had plenty of time to get his head round that, having been in the job a whole day.",51637,[],Housing,0,137,housing,1419

2009-06-09,Housing,393,Jeremy Corbyn,Lab,False,"It takes but an hour. There are major issues to address. We must review the housing finance system to end what is, in effect, the taxation of council tenants and ensure that the money is fed back to meet the needs of people on housing waiting lists. It should also go back into maintenance and support systems for existing housing stock and into ending the discrimination against council tenants who have freely made a choice not to undertake a stock transfer to a housing association and not to become part of an arm's length management organisation. They should receive public sector support in exactly the same way as anybody else does. I wish the Ministers well in their new positions. If we do not solve the housing crisis, the horrors of the rise of the far right and of the British National party, and the destruction of so many people's lives because of bad health, educational under-achievement and family break-up, will continue.

2009-06-09,Housing,394,Nadine Dorries,Con,False,"I congratulate the Minister on his new role. I thought he was still a Whip and had got lost, so I was delighted to learn that he has been promoted, and I hope he does very well. I benefited from right to buy, without which my family would still be living on a Liverpool council estate. When I canvass the housing association areas in my constituency, people always say to me, â€œWe love living here and we love our house. We wish we could buy it. We wish it was ours and we could pay for it ourselves.â€ I wanted to make that point before going on to discuss eco-towns. Perhaps the Minister will respond by outlining the Government's thinking, and what his thinking is as a new Minister, on right to buy. Will that be made available again? Will the Minister clarify the position on eco-towns? My constituency was targeted to have an eco-town of 20,000 new homes. There was no rhyme or reason to the proposed site of the eco-town. It was in the middle of green fields, next to a lake, in a valley; it was nowhere near any infrastructure, hospitals, doctors, shops, rail networks, public transport or road networks. The proposal was to put the eco-town in the middle of the local beauty spot and that made no sense. As far as my constituents are aware, that project has died a death, but will the Minister confirm that? Can the people of Mid-Bedfordshire say goodbye to the eco-town? I would like to inform the Minister of a positive effect that the eco-town proposal had for Mid-Bedfordshire: it made residents very aware of the dangers presented by Government house building targets. My constituents realised that the Government could allocate a target and an area and they would have very little say in what was built, how it would look, where it was positioned, how large it would be and whether it would serve any useful purpose. That energised my constituents. I have harnessed that energy and made good use of it, and at a large public meeting we formed a constituency-wide housing committee; another meeting is to take place in September. We have formed three more committees from that one: a central planning committee to identify where we think housing is needed and should go, the type of housing it should be and the local needs it should meet; a tourism committee, because we would like the growth development targets in Mid-Bedfordshire to be met through tourism; and an environmental committee to examine the impact of housing on the area. The three committees will all report to the central Westminster forum, and we will feed that information into the new Central Bedfordshire authority. The reason we are doing that is that, as I am sure the Minister is aware, the East of England regional assembly recently published a report in which it stated, having talked to developers, that there should be up to 120,000 additional homes placed in Mid-Bedfordshire. Given that we have only 77,000 homes at the moment, that is an incredible number of homes, and it would more than double the number in the area. As one can imagine, many residents were alarmed about that. One reason for our alarm was that we sit between Luton and Bedford. I do not know whether the Minister has been to either area, but both are desperately in need of inward investment and urban regeneration. The hospitals, Bedford hospital and the Luton and Dunstable hospital, are based there. The main employers are based in those areas, and they have good public transport, good road and rail links and good bus routes. There are good schools, which are not full, as those in my constituency are. There are doctors' practices there, whereas there are no places on doctors' waiting lists in Mid-Bedfordshire. There are dentists, whereas there are no dentists in Mid-Bedfordshire. Both Luton and Bedford have large numbers of people who need social housing or are on housing association waiting lists. They have employment and they live in the areas that need investment in housing. Yet, for some reason, the Government have decided that the housing should be placed in Mid-Bedfordshire, between those two areas but with no bus routes, no links, no employment and no infrastructure. I ask the Minister to let us know why, if he feels that Bedfordshire needs such a high density of housing, it is not appropriate to put that housing in the areas where the people in Bedfordshire are screaming out for it rather than in an area that is mainly agricultural and has no employment and no employers looking to move in. One housing proposal that was halfway through being built in Wixams has been blanketed, and the developers have walked away from it. It is not now being built, for the reasons that I have highlighted. Nobody is interested in the homes, because there is no employment. Can the Minister please inform me why he is not looking at the areas that need the houses to be built? We are not nimbyist in Bedfordshire. We are not saying, â€œNo building in our backyard, we don't need any.â€ Of course we do. We have a population that is growing at such a rate that we need homes, including social housing, but nowhere near 120,000 homes. As one can imagine, that is an alarming figure, and that is why our committee has been set up and is feeding into the new Central Bedfordshire authority, which I am sure will challenge those figures and challenge the Government head-on. I should like to finish, as another Member wishes to speak, but first I return to the eco-town. As the Minister knows, there were problems with the sustainability of the proposed town. No decision could be taken about whether it should be targeted at sustainability level 4 or level 5, and what would happen by 2020 when it was built and fully developed. Those are huge problems, and if the Minister answers none of my other questions I hope that he at least can confirm that the eco-town proposal in Mid-Bedfordshire is dead. Is that the last that we will see of it? That is important information for the residents, and for the committee that was formed because they were energised by that unwanted proposal, to take into account in our proposals to the Central Bedfordshire authority.",51637,[],Housing,0,140,housing,1072
2009-06-09,Housing,395,Bob Russell,LibDem,False,"I am grateful to colleagues for listening to Madam Deputy Speaker's requests to keep speeches short so that everybody can take part in this debate. In welcoming the new Minister for Housing to his inaugural debate, I could not help but note his telling observation that our homes matter more than anything else. That is obviously true, but if people do not have a home, or if where they are living is not adequate for their family's needs, the observation is an empty statement that means nothing. Unless people have a decent home, they cannot say that their homes matter more than anything else. The 2009 Budget will barely make a dent in the 1.8 million households estimated to be on the waiting list for housing. The Â£100 million for council house building will produce fewer than 1,000 houses. Some 400,000 children live in poverty, so the Government's pledges in â€œEvery Child Mattersâ€ are meaningless if those children have nowhere decent to live. It is not often that I am almost moved to tears, because I have been around long enough to see neglect and poverty before. But we are now in the third millennium in the fourth or fifth richest country in the world. Short of failure to defend the realm, the biggest sin that any Government can commit is to fail to house our people. The Government of Clement Attlee were recovering from war, but they managed to build council houses. Successive Conservative and Labour Governments also managed to do so for some 45 years. The record shows that Conservative Governments built marginally more council houses than Labour Governments-there was almost a race to see who could build the most. Some 25 years ago, housing shortages had virtually ended and, in my town, there was no such thing as bed-and-breakfast accommodation for the homeless. When Ministers tell the House that bed-and-breakfast accommodation has ended, they are wrong. I was nearly brought to tears by the sight of three little girls, aged two, four and six, running around the waiting room at my advice surgery. They had done nothing wrong. Whatever problems their parents may have had that put them in bed and breakfast-they are now on their second B and B, in Ipswich, having been exiled to Suffolk, even though the girls' school is in Colchester-the children have done nothing wrong. The cost of keeping that family in bed and breakfast is considerably greater than if they had been allowed to stay in their housing association house, even though rent arrears had accrued. That would have been cheaper and it would not have destroyed the family-I fear that the next step will be for the children to be taken into care. I hope that that does not happen. The last two lines of the Liberal Democrat amendment, which can be found on the Order Paper, would have been standard Conservative and Labour party policy throughout the '40s, '50s, '60s and '70s. They refer to the need toâ€œinvest in a large-scale homebuilding programme to address the crisis in social housing which disproportionately impacts on the most vulnerable.â€If we insert the word â€œcouncilâ€ for â€œsocialâ€, hon. Members will know exactly where I am coming from. The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) made a powerful speech, with which I agreed. The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) referred to rural housing. I represent an urban constituency, but the consequences of the failure to provide council housing in villages that would enable the next generation of the indigenous population to live there mean that families are quite often driven into the nearest towns, where the housing problems are then exacerbated. Reference has been made to empty dwellings in both the private and public sector. In fact, there is sometimes not a housing shortage but rather a mismatch because there are so many empty dwellings. In my constituency, the garrison town of Colchester, there are in excess of 200 empty family houses on the Army estate owned not by the Ministry of Defence but by Annington Homes, because the Conservative Government privatised them. The public purse is paying Â£3,500 a year for every one of those houses to stand empty. What a great tragedy it is that one of these houses could not be made available for the family of the three little girls who are in bed and breakfast in Ipswich. A compassionate Government would do something about that. I ask the Minister and his ministerial team to make urgent inquiries into why those 200 empty dwellings in my constituency cannot be brought back into public use, when the public purse is paying to allow them to stand empty.",51637,[],Housing,0,141,housing,779

During the course of this debate, I tried to add up the total number of housing associations in my constituency. I got to 10, plus Colchester Borough Homes. Is it not time that we had a rationalisation of housing associations in different areas? The majority of these housing associations do not have any local management. As I am sure that we all know from our advice bureaux, if management is not local, there is a danger that antisocial problems will arise.

2009-06-09,Housing,398,Justine Greening,Con,False,"This is the second housing debate that we have had in nearly as many months. Despite what has been said by Government Members, our first debate focused on the important issue of social housing but we felt that there was more to talk about, as housing is such a vital issue for our party. We therefore wanted to hold a second debate today, in our Opposition time, to highlight the many major issues affecting housing in England. In fact, we called this debate to represent the real concerns and difficulties in respect of housing that are faced by millions of people in Britain-the first-time buyers finding it almost impossible to get on to the housing ladder, the home owners struggling to pay their mortgages and stay in their homes, and the families stranded in overcrowded houses or whose names lie on forgotten waiting lists. Above all, the underlying problem that Ministers never want to talk about is the present depressed rate of house building. As of 2008, it has been lower in every year of this Administration than it was in even the worst years of the Major or Thatcher Governments. The people we represent face uncertainty and anxiety about whether they will get a home or keep the one that they have. If their circumstances change and they have to move, they are worried about whether they can remain in housing that meets their needs. Yet again, Ministers have talked a good game today about tackling housing issues-as ever, we have a lot of warm words-but I am afraid that the delivery has been sadly lacking. In both the good times and the bad times in our economy, there have been a series of failed schemes, headline-grabbing initiatives and misguided policies. The result is that Britain's housing is in a very sorry state indeed. Concerns have been raised by hon. Members of all parties about what is happening in their constituencies. The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) talked about the challenges faced by leaseholders, and she pointed out that we must make sure that our desire to enable people to get on to the housing ladder is implemented in a sustainable way. That was a fair point to raise. The hon. Lady doubted the Opposition's commitment to social housing, but I assure her that we would not have devoted two debates to housing if we did not recognise how important the topic was. We may have debates about policy, but we would not spend time listening to the concerns expressed by hon. Members in this House and by people out in the country if we did not recognise the importance of the issue. As a prospective Government in waiting, my party must be able to give people a proper alternative whenever the next election is held, and that means that we must have an informed policy on housing. We also heard from a number of Opposition Members in the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said that communities can come up with good suggestions about where housing should go. He said that people will take responsibility for discussing how their housing needs can be met, and my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) made a similar point. Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) is not in his place, but he made some very fair points in expressing his concerns about housing associations. He spoke about the need to make sure that they are accountable to the tenants whom they look after, and he made some thoughtful observations about housing waiting lists and the housing allocation priorities that local authorities constantly have to juggle. I am sure that we can all relate to what the hon. Gentleman said, but the problem underlying everything is the fact that the amount of our housing stock is so constrained. That is why we have to keep coming back to the Government's lack of delivery on housing. They have been in office for 12 years now, so we cannot say, â€œWell, it may get better in a few years.â€ All the evidence suggests that there is something fundamentally flawed in the Government's approach to housing policy, as otherwise more houses would have been built before now. We know that people are finding it hard to get on to the property ladder, as the number of first-time buyers fell to an estimated 300,000 in 2007, compared to 500,000 10 years before. There are also real concerns about sustainability: in 2007, nearly one mortgage in 10 was for 100 per cent. or more, and the problem is made worse by the lack of house building. On average, 23,000 fewer homes have been built every year under this Government, and housing starts this year are at their lowest since the 1920s. Social housing is beset with problems, too. As we heard, there are 1.8 million people on the waiting list. That is the consequence of a steady lack of house building in Britain over the past 12 years. That is compounded by the fact that people who have accommodation often find it unsuitable. We have 560,000 households living in overcrowded conditions in England, and 200,000 of those households are right here in London. I am sure that many London MPs who participated in the debate today see those people in their surgeries every day. It is difficult to discuss their problems because of the underlying fact that not enough new housing is being built to give them a chance of having a home that meets their needs. We spoke about the people who own their home but are struggling to stay in it. Repossession claims have soared from 67,000 a year in 1997 to a staggering 143,000 repossessions in 2008. The Government have talked the talk about how to help these people, but the mortgage rescue scheme that the Government launched has helped just two people. Ministers may say that it will take time for the scheme to produce results, but that was not the message last year when it was launched. Expectations have been badly let down by the scheme. There has been a range of failed housing policies, such as home information packs, which add cost to the sale process and stifle the supply to the market. Only today, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that it thought that HIPs had held back the market. As we heard, we still have no definition of a zero-carbon home. The Treasury has given tax relief on 18 homes, but the Department for Communities and Local Government does not know how to define them. Only under a Labour Government could one Department have a definition and another say that there is no definition. We heard about eco-towns, a complete disaster project that ran into the sands because local people said no. We know that green issues are important to people throughout the country, yet when it came to smuggling in eco-towns through house building in inappropriate places, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Nadine Dorries) pointed out, local communities will not have it. They want Whitehall to work with them and give them the responsibility for deciding where the extra housing will be. They do not want the top-down targets that the Government have given them. Let us not forget the disaster of the botched announcement on stamp duty last summer. We have not talked about that today, but if the housing market was under strain up until then, the Chancellor managed to stagnate it with that botched announcement and totally dried up the market in a way that would have been hard to achieve if someone had had to sit down and think about it as a challenge, but the Chancellor managed it. The range and gravity of housing problems under the present Government and the Department are clear to see. Fewer houses are being built, and there is greater overcrowding, growing waiting lists, falling home ownership and rising repossessions. The Government's record on housing is reflected in the chaos that we have seen over the past week in the Communities and Local Government team. The Housing Minister has gone. The Communities Secretary has gone. Even the Under-Secretaries were moved. They are not here today to defend their record on housing, but given the Government's history of decisions in this area, perhaps leaving their team was the one good decision that they have made so far. We cannot go on as we are. We can tackle the issues that we have been debating today-get rid of home information packs, take nine of 10 first-time buyers out of stamp duty, get rid of the top-down targets set through the regional spatial strategy, and have local housing trusts that make sure that local communities can decide for themselves how much new housing they have and where it is located. However, we will not resolve any of these important matters until we have a general election. We have had 12 years of failed housing policy. It is time to give the British people the general election that they so desperately need. Then we can have a Conservative Government who can deliver the sort of housing policy that will make a real difference to families throughout the country.",51637,[],Housing,0,144,housing,1555
2009-06-09,Housing,399,Ian Austin,Lab,False,"I thank Opposition Members for welcoming me and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing to our new positions. This evening's debate has been a very useful early induction for both of us, not least because it has been such a good debate among Members in all parts of the House. Despite the disappointment about the changes, to which the Opposition's motion refers, I am delighted to be doing this job, because for many people their homes are not just their greatest asset but their greatest source of security and a strong foundation on which so much else depends: good health, getting a job, building a career, fulfilling potential at school and being part of a community. My predecessor as Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright), made a similar point in a similar debate several months ago, when he said that housing brings safety, security, community cohesion, health, life chances, prosperity and a host of other issues. I pay tribute to the work that he did and welcome all contributions that all Members have made today. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing rightly set out this Government's impressive housing record, which the motion before us entirely ignored. He set out also our efforts to maintain and build on that record, despite the difficult economic circumstances. We have been proactive and decisive, learning from the experience of the 1990s about the consequences of delay and inaction. Although the motion finds fault in a number of our policies, it fails to propose any alternative. The Opposition obviously want to criticise our record on housing supply, because that is what they are there for, but they do not tell us that this Government's efforts led to the highest levels of house building in 30 years in 2007-08. The Opposition's motion also neglects to mention the 110,000 households that have been helped into shared ownership and shared equity through our programmes, and the Â£29 billion that we have invested since 1997 to bring more than 1 million social rented homes up to scratch. The Opposition also failed to mention the significant strides that we have made on homelessness, rough sleeping and temporary accommodation: statutory homelessness decreased by 60 per cent. between 2003 and 2008; rough sleeping has fallen by 74 per cent.; the number of households in temporary accommodation is down by 33 per cent.; and we have ended the long-term use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation for families with children. That is an impressive track record. Every previous Housing Minister should be very proud of it, and we are committed to building on it. That is why we have acted proactively and decisively in the economic downturn to help people at risk of repossession, first-time buyers and the construction industry. Our priority has been to help those in financial difficulties to stay in their homes wherever possible, which contrasts with the 1990s, when the Government failed to act while people lost their homes. My right hon. Friend spoke about the wide range of measures that we have introduced-to strengthen universal support and to bring in specific schemes-and, as a result, the Council of Mortgage Lenders is now expected to revise downwards its forecasts of repossessions. Although our critics clearly want to focus on the number of households at the final stages of specific schemes, they do not want to talk about the real help that families are receiving. Lenders covering 80 per cent. of the market either have signed up to the home owner mortgage support scheme or offer their own comparative arrangements. Thousands of families are getting free advice from their local councils every month and lenders now have to prove to the courts that they have exhausted all other options before seeking to repossess. We have also introduced new support, in the light of the restricted global supply of credit, to help first-time buyers get a foot on the housing ladder. We have also increased the availability of shared equity schemes and introduced a new â€œrent first, buy laterâ€ scheme. Demand for our existing schemes remains high.",51637,[],Housing,0,145,housing,681

We cannot afford to make the same mistakes twice, so we have put in place a comprehensive package of support: Â£1 billion at the Budget; buying up unsold stock from developers; bringing forward funding for affordable housing, including higher grant rates where needed; and the new kick-start fund to get faltering schemes going again.

2009-06-09,Housing,407,Ian Austin,Lab,False,"I will deal with that point in due course, but the point that I wanted to make related to my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), who spoke with great eloquence about the impact on families who face repossession, and the position of leaseholders. I congratulate her on the work that she is doing to protect her constituents from a local Conservative council, whose policies were set out in great detail. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), the Chair of the Communities and Local Government Committee, speaking with a knowledge and expertise that few in the House can match, made a fascinating contribution and a devastating critique of the Opposition's case. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), who has made himself an expert on housing issues, made a thoughtful speech about the state of the housing market and the need to remove the stigma attached to rented housing. I shall move on to the questions asked by the Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), if I may, but first I point out that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North and the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) asked questions about the housing association movement. We have set up a new regulator for social housing, the Tenant Services Authority, which will drive improvements in standards and place tenants at the heart of regulation. It will also have a wider range of powers to intervene when things go wrong. The hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield raised a number of questions about the impact of the Government schemes. He asked how many additional lenders had confirmed that they were signing up to the home owner mortgage support scheme. I can tell him that Lloyds bank, Northern Rock, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Bradford & Bingley, Cumberland building society and others signed up to the scheme at its launch. He will be interested to hear that a number of others have confirmed that they will offer the scheme as soon as possible, including the Bank of Ireland, GMAC RFC, GE Money and others. There is no cut-off point by which lenders must sign up to the scheme. The hon. Gentleman asked about take-up of the home owner mortgage support scheme. It is a new scheme; nothing like it has ever been tried before. It enables eligible households in short-term difficulties to defer part of their mortgage interest payments. Lenders covering more than 80 per cent. of the market have either signed up to offer the Government-backed scheme or are offering comparable arrangements. Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association have welcomed the impact that the scheme is already having on borrowers getting in contact with their lenders to discuss options. The hon. Gentleman talked about the low take-up of the mortgage rescue scheme. It is targeted at vulnerable households-those made up of the elderly or the disabled and those with children-who would be eligible for help under homelessness legislation if their homes were repossessed. The scheme involves households getting thorough advice on their financial circumstances, and selling part of their home, which takes time. More than 130 households have had repossession action against them halted, and more than 1,000 households struggling with their mortgage have received free advice from their local authority. We believe that 6,000 households will be helped over the next two years. I hate to disappoint the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Nadine Dorries), but I can only tell her that the eco-town programme was designed to deliver a final shortlist of up to 10 potential locations. However, decisions will be made on the basis of quality, not quantity. I cannot comment on specific areas, but it is not a done deal, and no decisions have been made on the locations in which work will go forward. The other point that she made was about the right to buy, which has helped thousands of families to realise their aspiration to own their homes.

Let me start by welcoming the new Housing Minister, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk), to his post. It is a really important job, and I am sure he will bring to it much-needed skill and insight, and I sincerely hope he will also bring a new sense of understanding and urgency. My experience from dealing with the hon. Gentleman is that he is a modest man, unlike his predecessor, who gave hubris a bad name. As the hon. Gentleman is new to his post, it might be helpful if I set out why we are having this debate. Today, the country is gripped by the biggest housing crisis in a generation and the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. Since the spending review, our economy has shrunk by 0.6%. As a result of this Government's twin failure on economic and housing policy, the reality is that Britain is one of just two G20 countries in a double-dip. The reality is also that this is a recession and a housing crisis made in Downing street-and is it any wonder, as the Chancellor has multiple jobs and yesterday's Housing Minister multiple identities, and both authored worthless plans on how to bounce back from recession? The facts are stark: house building is down, homelessness is up, private rents have hit record highs, and we have a mortgage market in which people struggle to get mortgages. The latest Government figures tell us that fewer than 100,000 homes were started in the 12 months to June, which is a 10% decrease on the previous 12 months and amounts to fewer than half the 230,000 new households being formed every year.",60973,[],Housing,0,2,housing,409

When the crash came, our response was very different from what happened back in the dark days of the 1980s. Did we stand back and wring our hands? No we did not. We acted to keep people in their homes. Through Kickstart and other programmes, we took action, resulting in 110,000 homes built, 160,000 jobs safeguarded and 3,000 apprenticeships.

The sad reality of the gulf between supply and demand means that this week and every week, 2,500 fewer homes are built than are needed. The Minister will be aware that although his predecessor said two years ago:â€œBuilding more homes is the gold standard upon which we shall be judgedâ€, housing starts under his tenure were lower in every quarter since Labour left power. The Minister will also know from his considerable experience in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills that the collapse in the house building industry has had a catastrophic impact on the construction industry. The Office for National Statistics has confirmed that the total volume of construction output in the second quarter of this year fell by 9.5% from the total in the same quarter of last year. The ONS confirms that that was driven by a fall in work on new private housing of 6.7% and a catastrophic 25% fall in the public housing sector. Two years ago, we warned the Government that by recklessly raising taxes and cutting spending too far and too fast, they risked putting the economic recovery at risk. We warned them that if they cut the housing budget by 60%, it would be a devastating blow not only to house building and the construction industry but to the wider economy and the millions of families desperately in need of a home at a price they can afford. The Government, having failed to listen to those warnings, cannot now escape their failure or duck their responsibilities for its victims. Perhaps most devastating is the rise in homelessness and rough sleeping, the very issues that the previous Housing Minister said brought him into politics in the first place. Statutory homelessness has risen for five consecutive quarters, up 14% in the past year alone. I do not know what brought the new Housing Minister into politics, but, with the new homelessness figures out tomorrow, will he tell us whether he expects to see a fall or an increase for the sixth quarter in a row? Most heartbreaking of all-we see it all over the country-there was a 23% rise in rough sleeping last year. It is a visible, visceral epidemic that harks back to the 1980s, when Tory policies led to cardboard cities under bridges and annual reports of deaths in cold English winters. It is not just those without a roof over their head who are suffering. The Minister's predecessor and the Prime Minister have claimed on the Floor of the House that private sector rents are falling, so perhaps the Minister can explain why the very company used by both the Prime Minister and yesterday's Housing Minister to justify their claims, LSL Property Services, reported only two weeks ago that rents hit a record high over the summer? As a consequence, we have the rise of â€œgeneration rentâ€ with 1 million young people predicted to be locked out of home ownership by 2020 as they face a squeeze on their wages, increasingly unaffordable rents and difficulties saving for a deposit, as evidenced by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.",60973,[],Housing,0,6,housing,524

Friend is absolutely right, and it is a bitter irony that the public purse, through housing benefit, is picking up the consequences of the failure to build new homes on the one hand and subsidising landlords charging ever higher rents on the other. There are other serious consequences of the growing housing crisis, from health to welfare. Bad housing harms health and costs the national health service Â£2.5 billion a year. It holds kids back at school, and the price tag for lost earnings of young people whose GCSE results have been affected by poor housing is Â£14.8 million. Unaffordable housing drives up the benefit bill. The Government's supposed affordable rent programme alone will drive up housing benefit by Â£1.4 billion. Despite the costs of the housing crisis and the Government's long record of failure, Ministers continue to claim that they recognise the importance of house building, including to the economy. Since cutting the affordable housing budget by 60%, the Government have announced and reannounced countless schemes and initiatives that promised to get Britain building. May I summarise but some? In November 2010, the Department for Communities and Local Government launched the new homes bonus, promising actionâ€œto get the country building againâ€. In March 2011, the Government launched â€œThe Plan for Growthâ€. Remember that? It said:â€œA successful construction industry is vital for sustainable growth. Building and maintaining homes...are activities that underpin the entire economy...it is critical that industry gets the support it requires to build houses on the scale the UK needsâ€. It promisedâ€œradical planning reformâ€that would deliverâ€œthe housing the country needs.â€At the time, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government welcomed theâ€œaction to get the house building industry building againâ€. Two months later, the Government launched Firstbuy, promisingâ€œa much-needed boost to our house building industry, supporting thousands of jobs across the country.â€In November 2011, the Government were at it again, launching the housing strategy. Do Members recall that it was described as the housing revolution? The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister donned their wellies, hard hats and high-vis jackets for the TV cameras as they promisedâ€œto restart the housing market and get Britain building againâ€with schemes, they said, that could create 400,000 jobs. All that with Â£420 million, but a tenth of what was cut the previous year by the Chancellor. Not four months later, in March this year, the Prime Minister and the former Minister for Housing hit the airwaves again, launching the New Buy guarantee and promising aâ€œboost to the housing market...and thousands of jobs in the construction industryâ€, and yes, you have guessed it,â€œto get Britain building again.â€So much has been promised-hundreds of thousands of jobs in the construction industry, hundreds of thousands of new homes, hundreds of thousands of new home owners-but what has been delivered? A contracting construction industry and collapsing housing starts, a growing housing crisis, a double-dip recession, and an array of announcements followed by a litany of failure. Can there be any more fundamental an indictment of failure than the fact that, at a time of economic crisis, when the Government have promised over and over again to build Britain out of recession, building starts fall quarter after quarter after quarter, pushing Britain back into double-dip recession?",60973,[],Housing,0,8,housing,542

2012-09-05,Housing,337,Jack Dromey,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend speaks with passion about her constituency and the problems she faces. All over the country, it is typical for there to be enterprising Labour local authorities. Would that we had an enterprising central Government who really believed in local government and its capacity to help build Britain out of recession. I return to where I was. Perhaps I am being unfair on yesterday's Minister for Housing. It turns out that he took it on himself to build, and with a dedication and passion that many would find hard to understand; he hid it, but he was beavering away, busy building-building up his following on Twitter. I hope that the new Minister for Housing will spend his time dedicating his full attention to the job. I advise him not to be obsessed with sending out press statements, as his predecessor was. If there were a new home for every press release from the last Minister for Housing, there would be no housing crisis. Perhaps he was trying to prove his prophecy, made from opposition:â€œit's easy for a housing minister to catch your eye with a headline, but much harder to deliver more homes.â€For once, he was absolutely right. The new Minister for Housing is taking on a position of huge responsibility and national importance. Every Member knows the scale of the housing crisis and will have stories from their own constituency. I have never-ending queues of heart-breaking cases-young couples paying a fortune in the private rented sector, often in sub-standard accommodation, desperate to get a mortgage, which, if they could get it, would mean that they would pay less to buy a home. But they cannot get a mortgage. Those on ever-lengthening council waiting lists are desperate to get decent accommodation. A couple with two young children came to see me; both burst into tears because of the impact that where they were living was having on their children. There are also the local small businesses. In my constituency, a man from the local construction company-a decent man, who had been in business for 25 years-came to me and said, â€œWe just can't get work any longer.â€ One in four young people in Castle Vale, an admirable community, is out of work. They are good young people, desperate for an apprenticeship in the building industry, but all their hopes are being dashed. They will find that this is a Government in complete denial as they spin a line that things are getting better; a Government who promised to get Britain building but are in denial about falling housing starts; a Government who promised to unlock the mortgage market but are in denial about the millions locked out of home ownership; a Government who promised that rents would come down but are in denial as they hit record highs; a Government who promised an â€œaffordable housing revolutionâ€ but are in denial, with the previous Housing Minister hailing a 68% fall in affordable home starts and a 97% collapse in social housing starts as â€œrapid and dramatic increasesâ€; a Government who once promised not toâ€œproduce endless policies and initiatives that...lead to inactionâ€or toâ€œrepeat these mistakes of the past.â€The time for half measures and half-baked schemes is over. The CBI was absolutely right when it said that we face a national economic emergency. Rising to that challenge starts with the political will to put housing centre stage, both to meet growing need and to get a sluggish economy moving. The Government must put jobs, homes and growth at the heart of everything they do, not least because history tells us that economic recovery requires us to build our way out of recession, whether it was the eventual revival from the long depression of the 1930s or Britain's post-war recovery when we built homes for our heroes on a massive scale. I know that on this, at least, the Business Secretary, the new Minister's former departmental colleague, will agree with me, because he has said:â€œRecovery requires a big expansion in social and private house building.â€He is in government, so the question is why are they not getting on with it? The Government need to show the same determination that a Labour Government showed in 2008. When faced with a global crash as a consequence of the bankers crisis, we acted to keep people in their homes, unlike in the 1980s when the Tories presided over the heartbreak of mass repossessions, and we acted to build new homes.",60973,[],Housing,0,20,housing,745

2012-09-05,Housing,341,Jack Dromey,Lab,False,"My right hon. Friend, who has a long and honourable track record on housing, is absolutely right. Tens of thousands of people are in their homes today because we took action when faced with those dire economic circumstances, in dramatic contrast to what happened back in the 1980s. Unlike this Government, during the recession Labour rightly increased investment in housing to provide the homes that people need and to secure construction jobs. As well as providing funding to build 112,000 affordable homes, we created and maintained 160,000 jobs and 3,000 apprenticeships for young people. Yesterday's Housing Minister will be familiar with those homes because, extraordinarily, the Government have tried to claim credit for them. However, as the National Audit Office has confirmed, of the 170,000 affordable homes in the next five years that he used to talk about, 70,000 were commissioned and paid for by a Labour Government. Labour is showing the same determination now as it did then, because we intend to put housing at centre stage of our economic recovery plan. We understand just how important investment in house building is as a means of economic revival. We know that for every Â£1 of public money spent on house building, studies have shown that the economy benefits by up to Â£3.50. Money spent on building affordable homes is money saved as unemployed building workers are put back to work, young apprentices are taken on, and less money goes out on housing benefit. We know that in transmission time it is the quickest way to get a sluggish economy moving. Investment is the key. The Government were absolutely wrong to cut Â£4 billion from the affordable housing budget in 2010, and no amount of press releases or half-cocked initiatives will fix that. That is why Labour has proposed bringing forward infrastructure investment, including for housing, and why we have called on the Government to use Â£2 billion from a repeat of the bankers' bonus tax to fund tens of thousands of affordable homes, not least because public investment can lever in investment from elsewhere. The National Housing Federation has said that public investment of Â£1 billion, matched by Â£8 billion from the housing associations, would build 66,000 shared-ownership homes for people on low to middle incomes, create 400,000 jobs and, in so doing, save the taxpayer Â£700 million in jobseeker's allowance, not to mention the added savings from housing benefit and increased tax revenues. The NHF also predicts a boost in growth, generating Â£15.25 billion in the wider economy. The Government should commit greater investment now-we would-rather than leave it in the pipeline. Next, the Government need to get the banks lending again. Small to medium-sized firms, including small builders, are crying out for investment, but the banks are not lending. Thus far, the Government schemes have failed. The Government must also urgently consider the case, proposed by my right hon. Friend the leader of the Opposition, for a British investment bank. The German state bank, KfW, is a good comparison, and a British investment bank could support the funding of new infrastructure. Next, the Government must encourage innovation among local authorities and housing associations. The Government took a welcome step forward by proceeding with Labour's plans to free up councils to build the next generation of council homes through housing revenue account reform. Indeed, along with the Labour leader of Southwark council, Peter John, I launched its plans to build 1,000 new, much-needed council homes. The Government must now provide help and support to those innovative councils that are taking advantage of that reform to ensure that they use the headroom to maximise the number of homes built. It seems that those most in need of support are Conservative-run local authorities. As a freedom of information request by my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has demonstrated, Labour councils are building while Tory councils sit on their hands. A survey showed that five times as many social homes for rent are being built in Labour authorities than in Tory areas.",60973,[],Housing,0,24,housing,679

Investment in the private rented sector should be encouraged. Many of the measures in the Montague report-for instance, those on the use of public land, on attracting investment and on standards in the private rented sector-are welcome. However, we strongly oppose the proposal to further water down the affordable housing requirements that councils place on developers. Those requirements enable communities and local authorities to insist on affordable homes in mixed communities. Developers simply should not be allowed to build for the well-off only. The Government should cut VAT on home improvements, repairs and maintenance to 5% to help home owners and small businesses, and to create jobs in construction and building supplies, from glass and bricks to cement. They should also implement a one-year national insurance tax break for every small firm, including building firms, that takes on extra workers. The Government have continued with Labour's drive to free up public land for house building, but they must go further. Innovative deals are being done, but we believe that it is appropriate for the Government to consider schemes to provide public land to housing associations and other developers free at the point of use, with payback over time. Such schemes would overcome the problem of the initial cost of land and get affordable house building going. I referred earlier to the way in which the Government tore up the planning system. They are now returning to fundamental reform of the planning system. It was ludicrous to blame the planning system before they reformed it. It is laughable to blame it afterwards. The Government cannot seem to make up their mind. The Chancellor said on â€œThe Andrew Marr Showâ€ on Sunday that the city of Cambridge was a good example of how the new planning framework that they introduced earlier in the year is working. Later, on â€œThe World This Weekendâ€ the Business Secretary used the same example to suggest that house building is being held back by the current rules.

2012-09-05,Housing,350,Jack Dromey,Lab,False,"I will come on to those interesting statistics. Under the planning system that the Government inherited, applications were overwhelmingly granted speedily and there was development land for in excess of 300,000 homes. The most recent data from the month following the NPPF's introduction show that planning approvals fell by 37%. The fact that homes are not being built is not the fault of the planning system. The principal problem is the failed economic and housing policies of the Government. To get Britain building again, we need to address the root cause of that failure-their failed economic plan, which has caused a lack of liquidity in the finance market, a shortage of mortgages for struggling first-time buyers, and the biggest squeeze on living standards in a generation. Whether it is the economy or house building, the Government will always find somebody else to blame. The Chancellor blames the weather, weddings and bank holidays, and the last Housing Minister blamed the planning system and affordable housing. The truth is that the reason for the collapse in house building, the contraction in the construction industry and the double-dip recession is a failed deficit reduction plan that cut too fast. We urge action in the motion that we have tabled. The Government's failures in respect of housing are not just those of policy, gross though those are, but fundamental failures of leadership on an issue that is vital for the future of our country. If the Government really meant what they said about getting Britain building, they would have put housing at centre stage in their economic recovery plan and invested in it. They would have invested to build the homes that millions of families desperately need and to support those struggling to pay rent in the private rented sector. They would have invested in the future of our young people, helping them to achieve their dream of home ownership.

2012-09-05,Housing,360,Mark Prisk,Con,False,"I will go further than that. I will meet the hon. Gentleman. It is my first day in this position and I want to know and understand the issues. My diary secretary may regret that, as I suspect that other Members will try to get in the queue. However, I would like to understand the issue before commenting on it. Not adopting the top-down approach works in practice. For example, our investment of Â£4.5 billion in funding new affordable homes over the spending review period levers in Â£15 billion from the private sector to deliver those properties. That makes a total investment of Â£19.5 billion in new affordable housing, which will help us deliver 170,000 affordable homes by the end of the Parliament. The Homes and Communities Agency has now reported that it has exceeded its targets for affordable housing this year, achieving a total of 51,665 affordable homes in England. Contracts have been signed for affordable house building in all parts of the country and across councils of all political colours. Affordable housing is at the heart of our agenda. We have consciously sought to introduce initiatives to ensure that housing is the most affordable for first-time buyers for a decade. Mortgage payments are the lowest for 15 years as a direct result of our action to tackle Labour's deficit. In July, Halifax noted that housing was now the most affordable for first-time buyers for a decade. Conservative Members are and should be proud of that record. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington said, of course the challenge for first-time buyers is getting a mortgage. We understand that, and that is why we have launched the New Buy scheme, which provides guarantees for mortgages of up to 95% loan to value for new build properties. That has already given a helping hand to prospective buyers who were otherwise frozen out of the housing market. The Home Builders Federation has estimated that New Buy could deliver up to 25,000 additional new homes over three years. The Government also introduced the Firstbuy scheme. Labour Members claim that we are not doing enough and criticise the initiatives. They need to decide what they actually want. The Firstbuy scheme supports capacity in the house building sector and is assisting almost 10,500 first-time buyers to purchase new build property in England by spring 2013. Interestingly, demand for the Firstbuy scheme has been strong. Official statistics published by the HCA show there had already been 3,000 Firstbuy sales by the end of March 2012, which is good progress.",60973,[],Housing,0,43,housing,424

2012-09-05,Housing,362,Mark Prisk,Con,False,"With respect to the hon. Lady, the idea that budgets across the Government are impervious to or not involved with the deficit we have faced- She has highlighted a point not only about the overall housing budget but about how that money is used. The point I was trying to make is that when dealing with affordable housing, it is not just about every pound we spend but about how we lever in other private sector funds, which is important. It is peculiar that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington applauded that principle a moment ago. We have reinvigorated the right to buy-supporting social tenants who want to own their own home. That is a policy of which the Government can, and should, be proud. We have reversed Labour's cuts, and increased the right-to-buy discount cap to Â£75,000 across England from April. For the first time, every additional home sold under the right-to-buy scheme will be replaced by a new home for affordable rent, with receipts from sales recycled across the cost of replacement. I wish that the cultural opposition of Labour Members to this issue would reflect the reality. The right to buy promotes mixed communities and gives social tenants a financial stake in the well-being of their neighbourhood. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington mentioned the right to buy, and he might now be able to help. My understanding is that the Labour group on the Local Government Association opposed the right-to-buy scheme.",60973,[],Housing,0,45,housing,245

I would love to be a fly on the wall at the hon. Gentleman's next meeting with the LGA Labour group. Let me move on to the issue of building new homes. I am alert to the fact that time has passed, and I wish to ensure that Back-Bench Members have the opportunity to speak, especially given the ruling from Mr Deputy Speaker. In many parts of the country, there is a difficult housing market. We are under no illusions about that and one has only to look around the world to see housing markets in real difficulties. Much of that is a result of the financial consequences of the housing boom and bust that took place under the previous Administration. That is why we have launched the Â£570 million Get Britain Building investment fund that will unlock stalled sites for up to 16,000 homes and hopefully create up to 30,000 jobs. In addition-we have had a lot of support from many Back-Bench Labour Members on this-we set up the Â£770 million Growing Places fund for local enterprise partnership areas to fund infrastructure projects that will help to unlock some of the more troublesome sites. We are accelerating the release of surplus Government-owned land, with capacity to deliver up to 100,000 new homes on brownfield land to the benefit of communities around the country. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington mentioned that point, and I shall look again at his representations. I must ask, however, why over 13 years the previous Labour Government did not do that already? Why did they wait until they were in Opposition and then try to lecture us on what should happen in the future? It is a shame, but I would always be happy to hear a positive representation on the issue.",60973,[],Housing,0,48,housing,362

Unlike the previous Government, whose eco-towns were promised and never happened, this Government do not intend to dictate to people or impose on them. We want to work with them, which is an important principle. Let me give an example of how that policy has worked.

2012-09-05,Housing,371,Mark Prisk,Con,False,"That is a perfectly sensible point, but I want to look at it in a little more detail and get to understand the issue. I am a chartered surveyor, so have perhaps the dangerous quality of a little knowledge of the subject I deal with as a Minister, but I want to ensure I understand the aspect to which the right hon. Gentleman refers, because the way in which the market works has changed. With respect to interventions, many hon. Members wish to speak in the debate, so I shall make some remarks on the important issue of homelessness and then conclude. We want to ensure that we tackle homelessness and the problems of the most vulnerable. As the right hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members have said, the problem has been with us for many years. All Governments need to ensure that they are positive and determined to tackle the problem, but they also need to reflect on the fact that outside issues and complex causes underlie homelessness. I want to look, for example, at ex-service personnel and other groups with regard to homelessness, even if the Government have made important steps before I was able to take on the role of Housing Minister. It is important to bear in mind that the statistics are not quite as bad as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington painted-he was a little unnecessarily partisan. The statistics show us that homelessness is half the level it reached under the previous Labour Government and that it remains lower than in 28 of the past 30 years. I am under no illusion that there are things to do, but we have one of the strongest safety nets in the world to protect families and vulnerable households from losing their home. In addition, through the Government's measures, councils have been able to help more than 13,000 vulnerable households to secure alternative accommodation when faced with the prospect of homelessness. We are already taking action to help 50,000 households in temporary accommodation-all hon. Members will know of that challenge from constituents in that situation who have come to see them. We have consulted on a new power that will allow local authorities to use the private rented sector to house homeless families. That will mean shorter waiting times for homeless households and less time in temporary accommodation. Those with young children in particular will want the time they spend in temporary accommodation to be reduced-that is important. I shall conclude now in order to allow as many Back Benchers as possible to contribute to the debate. The Government are working hard to substantially increase the supply of housing, from the low point of 2008-09. Our housing strategy combines practical measures with an understanding that Whitehall cannot, and should not, try to control the housing markets. Our work in helping first-time buyers, in freeing up the planning system and in unlocking stalled sites is all part of our commitment to enable more homes to be built. But we are not complacent. The global financial squeeze is continuing to impact. That is why, later this week, the Government will have more to say about how we can accelerate the progress already made in housing and infrastructure. By tackling the deficit, we have built the foundation for a sustainable economy. We are now focused on getting houses built, providing more affordable homes and making sure that home ownership is affordable once again. I commend the Government's amendment to the House.",60973,[],Housing,0,54,housing,581
2012-09-05,Housing,372,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"Listening to the new Minister for Housing reminded me of the words of a previous Prime Minister: â€œCrisis, what crisis?â€ The crisis is that we should be building 250,000 homes a year, but we are building 100,000-and the number is falling. The average age of first-time buyers is rising, waiting lists for social housing are rising, rents are rising, homelessness is rising, and the number of houses we are building is falling. In my definition, that is a crisis. The fact that we only built 50,000 social homes-or affordable homes, as the Government now choose to describe them, although not all of them are social homes or indeed affordable-in the first year of this Government, and only 15,000 last year, demonstrates the scale of the problem that we face. Last year, in my own city of Sheffield, we built two affordable homes. My hon. Friends the Members for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) and for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) and I could each let those homes to completely deserving cases in the first half hour of any surgery we hold. That is the scale of the problem. I do not claim that the 13 years of Labour government were perfect, or that we built sufficient homes. We had a reasonable record, but we did not build enough. However, the fact that we did not build enough makes this Government's performance in building even fewer that much worse-and our performance is no justification for that. The Labour Government had an excellent record on the decent homes programme. There was a clear national target to deal with the Â£19 billion backlog of disrepair that has already been mentioned. We then allowed local authorities and housing associations to get on with the job of delivering that target at local level. The reality for new construction is that the private sector-the major developers-has never built more than 150,000 homes in a year, and probably will not get near that number again any time soon. If we are going to hit the 250,000 target-and I hope we can get more homes built by the private rental sector and the institutional investors, and through self-build, as we saw on the Select Committee visit to Almere-we will have to build far more homes for social rent. We have to be brave. Whether this Government do it or a future Government, we have to set a target for 100,000 social rented homes a year. We delivered the decent homes programme and there is no reason why we could not deliver such a programme in the future. The Select Committee recently published a report that said that there is no one silver bullet or magic solution to building sufficient homes. We did come up with several ideas that were agreed cross-party by all members of the Committee, but I was disappointed that the Government's response dismissed or downplayed every single one. I ask the new Minister to go back and have another look, because some of those ideas are very appropriate. At a time when we are trying to build more houses in this country and when, as I understand it, the Government are looking to underwrite investment in social housing, it is ludicrous that they do not even mention housing authorities or arm's length management organisations as part of that programme, only housing associations. Of course, housing associations have a role to play, but why are we capping how much borrowing local authorities can do, when under prudential rules they could do more? These are the only form of assets against which local authorities cannot freely borrow to invest. Why is that rule there? Why do we have these arcane Treasury rules that treat borrowing for investment in housing by local authorities differently from how it is treated in every other EU country, including not only Greece, which somebody might mention as a reason for not doing it, but Germany? Why not look at what happens there and why they are successful? Why not look at the historical grant of housing associations and how we can redefine that to allow them to borrow more money? Of course, we ought to support attempts by housing associations and local authorities to borrow in the retail markets, but a housing investment bank to build the money in the private sector and connect it with those who want to invest would be another major step forward that the Government could get involved in. It might need public subsidy or the sort of underwriting that the Government are now considering, but these are big ideas. The idea of self-build, about which the previous Housing Minister was enthusiastic, needs a little Government support to fund pilots and get local authorities shaping up those schemes, as we saw in the Netherlands, but it could deliver tens of thousands of homes a year. When in doubt, the Government tend to blame the planning system, but it is this Government's planning system now-since the Localism Act 2011 and the changes in the national planning policy framework. They cannot keep blaming the planning system and creating more uncertainty about change, because that uncertainty will reduce the number of planning applications and slow down the whole system. I hope that in due course we will have a further debate on the Select Committee's report. It was an attempt to lay out several ways of getting house building going in this country, but the response was deeply disappointing. I ask the Minister to have a look at it, because it contained many ideas that, if put into practice, could move us towards the 250,000 homes a year that the country needs in order to solve its housing crisis.",60973,[],Housing,0,55,housing,948

I refer to collective amnesia because of the Labour party's persistent failure over 15 or more years-throughout its time in government-to deliver on housing. I include in that its under-delivery of affordable housing. The net result was the lowest amount of house building in peacetime since the '20s and-this is particularly troubling-a decline of about 421,000 in the amount of social rented stock available. The Opposition showed collective amnesia in their assertion that we should place faith in local councils. I agree with that, but the Labour Government trammelled the ability of local authorities to take decisions on planning matters that were in the interest of and reflected the needs and priorities of their local communities. They also showed collective amnesia over the failure of their dirigiste, top-down, target-imposed system for delivering housing on the ground, and over the sometimes perverse impact that unduly rigid adherence to targets for affordable housing and other planning obligations had on the delivery of viable sites. My hon. Friend the Minister knows that the Government have already started the important work of building greater flexibility into section 106 agreements.

The important point is that the current Government have started on the important task of rebalancing the planning system. I was privileged to undertake that work with my right hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) and it gives a strong basis for policy going forward. It was ludicrous that we had such a complex system of planning and, allied to that, the top-down imposition of targets, which were a positive impediment to growth, not least because they set communities against appropriate growth. That created a system of tension and antagonism, which the national planning policy framework rightly seeks to remove. The final point that I should like to make in that context-and which I know my hon. Friend the Minister will take on board-is that we must look at planning and housing policy holistically. We should look at the interactions between housing policy and planning policy, and also at the need to give local authorities incentives to support sustainable growth-for example, through the way in which we are reforming the funding of local government finance. All three are parts of the same equation, if I may put it that way, and I hope that my hon. Friend will feel able to build on the work started in the Localism Act 2011 and the Local Government Finance Bill; I do not know whether he will inherit it, but I assure him that he will find it cheerful bedtime reading. The reality is that this Government are removing blockages in the system. My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Gareth Johnson) rightly referred to the change at Eastern Quarry. That project had indeed stalled; it is also something that, in my responsibilities for the Thames Gateway, I had some involvement in, together with my right hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps). I should also say that the realism shown by the Conservative-controlled local authority of Dartford council was a major help. However, the irony is that the system we inherited from Labour did not allow willing parties to come together and renegotiate an agreement to produce a more realistic reflection of current market conditions. Our Government gave them that flexibility; they took advantage of it and now those homes will be delivered. Indeed, the first homes will be delivered this year, which I hope will be a matter of pride to everyone associated with the project. I also hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will continue to build on the work that we have already seen with the Growing Places fund. There will be sound arguments to consider if in due course we are able to roll it out further, into the type of revolving infrastructure funds that have been talked about by informed sources in many parts of the industry. I also hope that he will continue to look at refinements to the operation of the community infrastructure levy-the CIL-so that it is a positive incentive to development and brings a genuine benefit to local communities. Again, however, we should look at some of the technical detail. For example, there are some excellent schemes, such as the one developed by Pocket in London, that do not require any public subsidy, yet they can face difficulties because they do not count as affordable housing under the CIL rules in the same way that they do under planning policy. Those are some small but important matters that I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will take on board. I know him to be an enthusiastic Minister and a good colleague.

The construction industry, in which Marshalls is a major player, should be at the heart of any economic recovery. Indeed, on 3 July, I tabled an early-day motion calling on the Government to back the Get Britain Building campaign. The campaign has three simple but important aims. They are to encourage the building of affordable housing, the stimulation of home improvement with a cut in VAT and investment in infrastructure. The Government should start to do those things today. Any economic recovery must be demand-led, with the construction industry at its heart. Such action could be a catalyst for economic recovery. I am sure that the Minister would acknowledge that every Â£1 invested generates Â£2.84 in economic activity. The message is simple: get building, and do it now.

I do not know what the promised announcements will be, so I would like to comment on what I would like to see and what the Liberal Democrats would like to push for in the future. Throughout, I feel that we need to acknowledge that some of the problems we are discussing have indeed gone back over decades and under all previous Governments. Just to keep up with the rate of household formation, we need between 206,000 and 282,000 additional homes each year between now and 2025, yet the average number of new homes added to the housing stock each year in England over the last two decades has been just 160,000 and is currently even lower than that. It is quite clear that we have not met housing need. We need to think about housing demand, too, because the fact that people cannot access mortgages at the moment is another cause of reduction in demand. There is a shortage of mortgage finance, which I feel has to be addressed. I acknowledge, however, that the coalition has done much to help first-time buyers. I want to concentrate on the supply side, while acknowledging that both demand and supply are important to the issues we are addressing. Undoubtedly, investment in housing would provide an important kick-start to the construction industry, and hence to the economy. We know of the massive multiplier effect of everything spent internally in our country on the construction industry. It is a win-win situation, with more jobs and more money created for our own economy, without particularly sucking in imports. Social housing waiting lists have grown by 70% over the last 10 years. Over 1.7 million families are stranded on housing waiting lists, yet social housing stock has fallen by 420,000. We have seen very little council house building. My hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell) repeatedly questioned the last Government on that point. We want to see councils building more. The coalition Government have taken some significant steps to give local authorities more freedom to raise more money in order to invest in their local areas-for example, the new homes bonus, tax increment financing and the community infrastructure levy. Reform of the housing revenue account is also important, as it leaves local authorities free to determine how housing revenues are invested. However, there is the cap on borrowing, and I agree with previous speakers that we should be looking to lift it and secure more powers for local authorities to borrow and invest in councils. Securing private finance is critical, and we need to explore further how the long-term investment needs of pension funds and insurers can be met through housing. The coalition Government have increased local authority new build. We have the new homes bonus, the one-for-one replacement condition attached to the right to buy, and the new â€œaffordable rentâ€ model, which will provide 170,000 new social and affordable homes. However, as a Liberal Democrat I should like more local rather than centrally led decisions to be made on the right to buy. The coalition is taking steps to provide more land for development by freeing up public land and trialling land auctions to enable more homes to be built, but I am sure that more can be done. For instance, there are 300,000 or 400,000 existing outstanding planning permissions. I think it outrageous that, when planning permissions have been granted, developers come back wanting to intrude on our green belt. We need a stronger â€œuse it or lose itâ€ policy on planning. That is a Liberal Democrat point, by the way. We should also think about the environmental impact of housing. The challenge is to deal with the dilemma of quantity versus quality. It is more expensive to provide homes that meet renewable and energy efficiency conditions. I congratulate the coalition on its empty-homes policy. We have taken big steps in this regard. There are 720,000 empty homes in England, 279,000 of which are considered to be long-term empty properties. Under the last Labour Government, there was no dedicated source of central Government funding to tackle empty homes, but the coalition Government have established a Â£100 million empty homes fund and some really good schemes to help people to return empty homes to use. The new homes bonus is paid in such cases, and there is also an empty homes premium. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell), who initiated the premium, and congratulate him on the work that he did in the Department for Communities and Local Government. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill).",60973,[],Housing,0,66,housing,803
2012-09-05,Housing,384,Yvonne Fovargue,Lab,False,"Thank you for calling me, Madam Deputy Speaker. I, too, welcome the Minister to his post. I want to discuss some policies that have not yet been mentioned. The first is the bedroom tax, or under-occupation penalty, which is blatantly unfair to social housing tenants. Many of them have lived in their properties for a considerable time and regard them not as housing stock assets but as their homes-homes with memories, in which they have built their lives surrounded by families and friends. Leaving that aside-if it can be left aside-I have to say that this blanket policy shows absolutely no understanding of the mix of housing stock in boroughs such as Wigan. Members of Wigan and Leigh Housing, my local housing trust, came to London to meet the previous Housing Minister-who has, shall we say, gone on to higher things-to explain the current predicament. Wigan has an over-supply of three-bedroom properties, which constitute about 50% of our social housing stock, and not enough one and two-bedroom properties. More than 4,300 of our 22,500 tenants will be affected by the under-occupation penalty, and they will have no real choice. They must pay the penalty, or move to private rented properties that will cost more. It has been estimated that if only a quarter of them want to move, it will take 10 years to re-house them at the current rate. In the meantime, how are they to pay the penalty? There is already concern about the rise of the payday lenders among tenants of social housing. Our tenants are taking out payday loans to maintain their household budgets because of the increased costs of food and fuel. Wigan has been described as one of the most car-dependent communities in Britain: people need their cars in order to get to work. All those problems will be compounded by the bedroom tax, which will force residents to pay at least 14% for one extra bedroom and 25% for two. It should not be forgotten that housing benefit is an in-work benefit which is paid to hard-working people on low incomes, or to pensioners who have worked all their lives with little or no occupational pension. The bedroom tax will add a further pressure to their already overstretched income. It will push them into the outstretched arms of the payday lenders in order to cover their day-to-day living expenses, causing them to fall into a spiral of debt. What point is there in forcing my constituent who is a single dad who has his two children at the weekends to move into a non-existent one-bedroom property? How will that help the family? If he does not move, he will be charged to remain where he is. How will his financial contributions to his children's upbringing be maintained? This is both unfair and unworkable. How will forcing the grandparents who came to see me to move into a one-bedroom property help their family? They look after their grandchildren at the weekend so their mum can work. They are all doing as the Government wish by supporting their family, but they will be forced to pay for that. That is not justice or fairness; it is taking money from those who can least afford it. I have mentioned how difficult it is to balance the family budget, and another measure may well add to that problem: the payment of housing benefit to the tenant rather than directly to the landlord, where the tenant wishes. I have had direct experience of that, as I was involved in a pilot scheme with the private sector when the private sector tenants were paid direct. Our local authority was so concerned about this matter that the Labour government gave additional money to pilot areas in order to work with the private tenants on budgeting and opening bank accounts and to identify their vulnerabilities. That work was greatly needed. An independent assessment of the pilot credited the success of that St Helens scheme to the intensive work done by Citizens Advice locally. However, no extra money will be given for that work in future, and Wigan and Leigh Housing and its tenant representatives are very concerned that payment arrears will result if this scheme is introduced without proper financial guidance and support on money management. They also fear that there will inevitably be evictions and a rise in homelessness, and Crisis is also concerned about that. I am also concerned about the extension of the shared accommodation rule to the under-35s, as that will also exacerbate the homelessness problem. Wigan and Leigh Housing is working with Citizens Advice to assist people affected by this rule by drawing up property lists and trying to match properties and individuals, but people are rightly concerned about moving into shared accommodation with others whom they do not know, and some are saying, â€œActually, I'd rather sofa-surf than do that.â€These changes are individually harmful, but they are cumulatively disastrous, and they show no understanding of the northern towns and their people, or their problems. They will not create sustainable and supportive communities. Instead, they will hit individuals who are trying to do the right thing. Debt levels will increase, and the payday lenders are already circling my estates, waiting to prey on people being forced by the Government to pay to have a family life in their own community.",60973,[],Housing,0,67,housing,894

There is nothing further I can do about that; it is now in Members' hands.",60973,[],Housing,0,68,housing,85
2012-09-05,Housing,386,George Hollingbery,Con,False,"I hope colleagues will forgive me if I ramble through my remarks fairly swiftly, as I have quite a lot to get through. The lack of housing for British people is of great concern to all of us, and we have to ask ourselves why sufficient homes are not being built. It is a simple matter of economics. Interest rates may be low, but the country is deleveraging. Private individuals are very cautious about increasing debt, which means fewer individuals are looking to buy. Banks are strengthening their balance sheets, and reducing their risk profiles and setting aside capital. The ultimate consequence is that there is a smaller pool of people who want to borrow, and fewer of them are qualifying for borrowing, and less money is available to lend to them. In short, this all boils down to a reduction in the amount of capital available to build homes. Is it any wonder, therefore, that house building numbers are falling? Although Â£19.5 billion of public and private funding is currently lined up to be spent on affordable housing by 2015, there is very little land to build it on. That land relies on section 106 agreements from private housing developments and they are not happening. Back in the earlier part of this year, the Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts), proposed that we reported on the financing of new housing supply. That report was published in May. The broad conclusion, as he has already said, was that there was no one silver bullet with which the housing deficit could be removed. The crucial question is now what can be done and whether the Government are acting on the possibilities. A number of options are available to the Government and action has been taken on some. First, crucially, we must keep interest rates under control. We are borrowing internationally at the lowest interest rates in history and that is a crucial part of the package. Any serious upward tick in rates would almost immediately increase the strain on existing owners through their mortgages, reduce the already low level of building and price further prospective owners out of the market. The clear implication is that any measure that added significantly to the debt burden the country is carrying would be likely to be entirely counter-productive in the medium term and might even reduce the number of houses available. Secondly, the Government can look to their own assets. They can provide public land for development, such as that brought forward under the â€œBuy now, pay laterâ€ scheme, which has been widely welcomed. Grainger plc said that that would help it run a build-to-rent programme. The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities reported to us that it was actively investigating investing its pension funds in rental accommodation on land that it would provide, with both funds coming together to make a cohesive package. The Government can provide guarantees to lenders and borrowers, and we have heard a great deal about that with the announcement of the Get Britain Building programme and the Firstbuy equity deal. We have had the New Buy guarantee and just at the beginning of August the funding for lending scheme was announced. That is an 18-month programme to allow almost unlimited borrowing by swapping assets for funding from the Bank of England to invest in small businesses and lend to private individuals to buy homes. We can also return the control of local council housing assets to councils. That programme was started by the previous Government, and I salute them for doing so. The Smith Institute said that Â£25 billion of real-terms investment will be made available for housing through that change. I have concerns, shared by the Chairman of the Select Committee, about debt caps, which we ought to re-examine, and the sharing of debt limits across councils. It seems to me that there is extra capacity in the system that could easily be brought into play, allowing us to build more social housing. There are the new rules on right to buy, but care must be taken to replace not only one for one, but, if at all possible, like for like in the area in which property was sold, particularly in small rural villages. New council developments to be let at a discount on market values can also be very valuable. We took evidence that the affordable rent programme will make a contribution; it will be limited over time and geographically and there will be restrictions, but it will help in the end. I will end there, but there is no doubt that we are at the end of the tail of an extraordinary debt crisis, which was left to us by the previous Labour Government. Essentially, that legacy of debt restricts the amount of capital available in the marketplace and the options available to the Government. I believe that they are doing all they can within the envelope for borrowing and I commend them for what they do.",60973,[],Housing,0,69,housing,840
2012-09-05,Housing,387,Simon Danczuk,Lab,False,"It does not take a genius to recognise that investing in construction at a time of economic difficulty can have a positive impact. The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills said in June:â€œThe experience of the 1930s tells us, however, that it is possible to build, and grow, out of deep economic crisis without abandoning deficit reduction.â€Even in the Government, there are people who believe that house building is a key part of getting the economy going. Even the Prime Minister said last November:â€œWe will restart the housing market and get Britain building again.â€The only problem is that the Prime Minister did not tell us when he would restart that housing market. House building is in decline. The Government have used up all the house building credits bequeathed to them by the previous Labour Government, and now that they are having to rely on their own policies, house building is falling. Affordable housing starts have declined by 68% over the past year. Overall house building has decreased by 10%. That shows that the Government have failed. They have not used house building to stimulate our economy, which is part of the reason why Downing Street has taken us into a double-dip recession. In many ways, Downing Street has failed to listen to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills-it could have used construction to drive the economy forward. Having said that, the Secretary of State has also been part of the problem, ably accompanied by the new Minister for Housing and the BIS team: they have pushed us towards a bank lending crisis. The new Minister for Housing, when part of the BIS team, introduced Project Merlin, which failed. They then tried a loan guarantee scheme. That failed. They then tried funding for lending. That has failed. Two and half years into their time in government, the banks still are not lending. It is the same story in housing-New Buy, Firstbuy, the new homes bonus and the Growing Places fund; the list goes on-but what we do not have is a co-ordinated effort to get people taking up mortgages and to get houses constructed for them to move into. In practically every aspect of housing policy, there has been failure. There are people in Rochdale crying out for social housing and for jobs. If the Government had got their housing and lending policies right, we could have had the construction jobs and the homes in places such as Rochdale. Sadly, we have neither. If that is not bad enough, the Government are dismantling the housing safety net that helps many people. More people are becoming homeless. It costs more to help people who are homeless than it would to stimulate the housing economy and support the housing charities that support homeless people. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue) mentioned the bedroom tax. People on housing benefit will have to pay a supplement to stay in their home or they will have to move out. One important point regarding the bedroom tax, which I do not believe the Government have considered, relates to community cohesion. Rochdale is a case in point, although this will apply to many towns and cities across the country. The bedroom tax will mean that many people who have lived on council estates for many years, and brought their children up on those estates, have to move out. Owing to the demographic changes in places such as Rochdale, it is inevitable that a perception will build up that members of one community are being forced out of their home for the benefit of those from another community. I ask the Minister to address that issue of community cohesion, because it will cause real problems and there is the possibility of its being exploited by the far right. I ask the Minister to take a sober view of housing policy and urge him to use housing and house building as key drivers to create jobs and re-establish the economy that we desperately need in Britain.",60973,[],Housing,0,70,housing,674
2012-09-05,Housing,388,Mark Pawsey,Con,False,"After listening to the measures outlined by the new Minister at the Dispatch Box, no one could accuse the Government of being negligent in their approach to house building. That contrasts with the record of the previous Government. The number that was not on the tip of the shadow Minister's tongue when I intervened earlier is 78,340, which is the figure for new houses started in the last full year of the previous Government. It was given to the House by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell). The shadow Minister told us that he is happy to support the record of the Labour Government, but that number pales into insignificance when we consider the fact that in 2011, the first full year of the coalition Government, 98,250 houses were started-a rise of 25%. Those figures make the motion ridiculous as it claims that housing starts are down. We all agree, however, that we need to build more houses. Statistics from the industry analysts Glenigan have been published today in The Daily Telegraph, under the headline â€œ2,000 new building projects approved every month since planning shake-upâ€. The article goes on to detail how the proportion of planning applications that are successful has increased by 8% since the introduction of the new national planning policy framework, from 73% in November 2011 to 81% in March 2012, leading to more consents in total, from 75,000 to 85,000.

2012-09-05,Housing,390,Mark Pawsey,Con,False,"Absolutely. The national planning policy framework is starting to bear fruit, so it was disappointing to hear Labour Members criticise the changes. Planning delays have been stifling house building. I want to focus on planning guidance and the delays that planning applications consultees continue to be able to cause in the development process. The Government's consultation paper on statutory consultees drew attention to 27 external bodies. It stated:â€œThis can mean authorities are reluctant to determine applications without input from these key bodies.â€That is where planning delays come in. I refer to my own constituency of Rugby where, I am proud to say, we have a very positive attitude to housing development and recognise the need to grow to provide accommodation for new households. Work has just started on the Gateway site, which will provide 1,300 new homes. In addition, over a period of time landowners have been working on proposals for a major house building site that will generate 6,200 homes-the former BT mast site. It is just the kind of development that the Government recognise as necessary to provide housing and, as Members across the House have indicated, move the economy forward. So what is the problem at the mast site? Even though the development complies with the local core strategy and the land was previously developed, the proposals are being slowed down, in my view needlessly, by stakeholder agencies such as Natural England and English Heritage, which are concerned about their own single issues, which I believe are being given disproportionate weight. In a second case, a constituent has applied to develop a site adjacent to a pond. As a result, a full newt survey has been requested before development can proceed, even though it is known that the habitat does not and cannot support newts. Again, that is holding up development. Even post-NPPF, external bodies have the powers to frustrate development. The NPPF was a good start, but there is still much more to do, and the Government recognise that in the new economy Bill, which will focus on reducing the time allowed for repeals and reviews, among other things, and help both development and the economy. The substantive motion states thatâ€œthe Government needs to take urgent action to get the economy and house building going againâ€. They have and they are. I congratulate the previous Housing Minister on all his hard work in supporting the housing industry and look forward to the new Minister taking the Government's agenda forward.

2012-09-05,Housing,393,Nick Raynsford,Lab,False,"May I first draw attention to my interests, as declared in the register? I intend to focus on three themes. First, I will debunk some of the myths and, frankly, the abuses of statistics that we have heard today from those on the Government Benches. Secondly, if time allows, I will offer my analysis of why we face this dire situation. Thirdly, I will suggest one practical way the Government could and should act to start new house building and help to get us out of the mess. The Government know that the housing situation is dire-their own statistics tell the story clearly-but rather than face the facts, they have been pretending, through what is, frankly, a shameless abuse of statistics, that the picture is rosier than it really is. The former Minister for Housing was at it all the time and the Prime Minister was at it today, claiming during Prime Minister's questions that housing starts were up. The Government amendment to the motion repeats the error and even the new Minister for Housing, for whom I have great respect and whom I welcome to his post, repeated the same incorrect claim. The only way in which the Minister can justify the completely non-credible claim that housing starts are up is by comparing the latest figures with those for 2009. Why 2009? There is no statistical justification for plucking out of thin air a year that simply produces a good outcome. It is as if a Health Minister, faced with an epidemic, chose to compare fatalities during their period with those of 1348, when the black death was ravaging the country. The truth of the matter is that 2009 was the depth of the recession and the figures were very low, but they recovered because the Government of the time had put in place measures to help recovery. The second quarter of 2010 was a significant period because government changed hands. I do not think that this Government can claim, although the previous Minister for Housing tried to, that the figures for that quarter were their responsibility, but by that quarter, starts were back up to 33,000. If the new Minister looks at his figures, as I hope he will-his officials will be able to guide him on this-he will see that in no quarter since then has that figure been exceeded. In the latest quarter, the total number of new starts was just 23,000-10,000 fewer than in the second quarter of 2010. Can we put an end to that abuse of statistics? Yes, the recession had a dire effect, but we were coming out of recession when the Government changed, and since then housing has been flatlining at levels hopelessly inadequate in comparison with the need for new housing. We have to find ways of stimulating new growth. Time is limited, so I shall go to my final point-my modest suggestion about how the Government can get some new house building started. The Minister will know that the worst hit area has been social housing because of the serious cuts made in the early months of the coalition in the social and affordable housing programme. That has drastically cut back investment in new social and affordable homes. I support the Government's measures to try to lever in more private finance, although there are disadvantages to do with rent levels, which will have knock-on consequences for housing benefit. The measures are nevertheless an intelligent way of trying to get as much building as possible. However, Government investment is not adequate or sufficient. I know that the Government will say, â€œWe can't put any more money in,â€ so let us look at what is not being well spent at the moment. There it is, in the Minister's own Department-he has only to look at his budget to see Â£250 million a year, over the next three years, allocated to the new homes bonus. I wholly disagree with the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), who spoke earlier about the bonus. It gives absolutely no benefit at all-there is no evidence to show any positive impact that it has had. The scheme itself is opaque. The linkage to the granting of planning consent, which it is supposed to incentivise, is so tenuous that, not surprisingly, no serious commentator believes it is having a beneficial effect. But it is very expensive, costing Â£250 million a year over the next three years. If that money were reallocated to direct investment in social and affordable housing, that could help to get things going. Linking schemes for social investment with private investment and mixed developments would help give greater confidence in the market as well. Steps can be taken, but they require the Government to be intelligent in their use of money and recognise that they have to find ways of investing to get us out of the serious mess we are in.",60973,[],Housing,0,76,housing,822
2012-09-05,Housing,394,Mark Spencer,Con,False,"I want to focus briefly on three issues that are having a big impact in my community-what type of houses we build, where we build them, and how many we build. Those are the three crucial aspects to the whole debate and they are having an enormous effect in my constituency and community. I shall start with the issue of how many houses. The Secretary of State is not in his place, but to his credit the first thing he did was abandon the disastrous regional spatial strategy figures that were having such a detrimental effect on the green belt in and around the city of Nottingham. Some of my local authorities are resting on those figures from the regional spatial strategy. I sincerely hope that the Minister can find ways of convincing them to reconsider the numbers of houses they are going to plonk in the green belt and focus on where and how those houses are being developed because they are having an enormous impact on the sustainability of the local communities. Where windfall properties appear because a petrol station or public house becomes redundant and is redeveloped, some local authorities do not take those figures into account but continue to push up their housing ambitions, and that has a big impact on the green belt. Let me deal next with what we are building. It is very important that we build houses that are appropriate to the communities in which they are placed. An elderly resident in a rural village location who is living in a three, four or even five-bedroom house might want to relocate in the same village, but if it has no elderly people's accommodation they will be forced to move away from the community in which they have established their life, family and friends, and connections. If we can find ways of building elderly people's accommodation within those village envelopes, that will allow people to move out of the larger house and into another property, thereby freeing up the property ladder below them. We do not want to force people out of their homes, but we need to encourage them to stay within their communities. By the same token, in former coalfield villages where the average size of a house is two or three bedroom, there is little point in allowing developers to build four and five-bedroom houses, because they do not slot into those communities. The most important issue is where houses are built. Some of my local authorities are not targeting brownfield sites. They should be developing former coalfield sites such as those in the borough of Gedling, but are instead putting their housing allocations in the green belt around the villages of Linby and near the town of Hucknall. There is funding available to address this. The previous Housing Minister developed a scheme whereby such brownfield sites could be unlocked because of the need for access roads and other infrastructure projects. Despite my writing to my local borough council to ask them to tap into that fund, it has decided not to do so but to allocate its housing allocations in the green belt. That is a tragedy for some of these villages, because the infrastructure cannot support what is there already, never mind the new housing. The village of Blidworth is the only local village entirely encircled by the green belt, and it already suffers enormous infrastructure problems regarding access to the road network, but, for whatever reason, the council has decided to allocate it an enormous amount of housing, causing a great deal of stress and tension for individuals. This is about getting right what we are building, where we are building, and how much we are building. I believe in localism, but sometimes my local authorities do not make the right choices.",60973,[],Housing,0,77,housing,635
2012-09-05,Housing,395,Siobhain McDonagh,Lab,False,"I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to what must be one of the most exciting jobs in Government. He will be at the heart of improving our economy by building more homes, and I am sure that it will be a really exciting period. I thank my hon. Friend the shadow Minister for calling this debate at such an apposite time. I would like to ask the Minister to reconsider the introduction of the provision in section 124 of the Localism Act 2011, on the forced discharge of a family into the private sector if they are homeless. As the law stands, if a family are recognised as being homeless, they can be offered a property in the private sector, and they can be discharged to it if they accept it, but they do not have to do so. Under the provision, they would have to accept it. My reason for opposing the provision is not in any way because I am anti-private sector; it is because I believe that we should do everything we can to ensure that work pays. Work is the best anti-poverty strategy that anybody has ever known. It represents a moral good for individuals, helps them stay healthy and gives a good example to their children. The provision will force working families into a benefit dependency from which they are unlikely to ever be released. I want to detain the House with three or four examples-depending on the time available-of how that would affect people in my constituency in south-west London. Although it is an expensive area compared with some other places in the country, it is certainly not in London terms. In the first example, Mr Brown is a postman and Miss James works in an after-school club where her two children go to school. They have an income of Â£26,000 a year, which is roughly Â£500 a week. If they were discharged to the social sector, the median rent for a two-bedroom property would be Â£95 a week. On their income, they would not be entitled to any benefit-they would be discharged, off benefit and would have to pay their rent. If that same family on the same income were discharged to the private sector, the median rent would be Â£196.15 a week. On their same earnings, they would receive housing benefit. Even if their income increased by Â£200 to Â£700 a week, they would still get approximately Â£20 a week in housing benefit, but they would be Â£83 worse off than families in social accommodation. If Mr Brown and Miss James's income was Â£600 a week and it was increased to Â£700 a week, not only would they incur the cost of child care, travelling to work and so on, but the loss of their housing benefit would be such that they would gain only Â£25 out of that additional Â£100 of income. How is that an incentive to go to work? The marginal rate of tax would be 75% in the private housing sector and 32% in the social sector. That is not an oddity-I could give many other examples. Mr and Mrs Ossai have four children and they lost their home as a result of the collapse of Mr Ossai's business. Mrs Ossai is a district nurse-a fantastic person whom people would want to be their neighbour. The family's income now stands at about Â£34,000 a year, which is Â£650 a week. This lady was willing to accept a tenancy in the private sector, for which the median rent is Â£253 a week. That meant that even if her income was Â£1,000 a week, she would still get housing benefit. I asked her not to accept that offer from the council-thereby earning the hatred of its housing department-and she is now in a three-bedroom flat in what is not the best estate in town, but in which her family can live and whereby she can earn enough to receive no benefits and to be independent. Moreover, she is a fantastic neighbour, because all the families, elderly people and those with kids who live nearby can go to her and see her going to work as a district nurse. She is a role model. This is about communities that have all sorts of people, and it is about providing role models and getting people off benefits, but the Government's simple provision will force, according to the their own figures, 20,000 working families into housing benefit, and that is wrong.",60973,[],Housing,0,78,housing,749
2012-09-05,Housing,396,Alec Shelbrooke,Con,False,"I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing to his new role. I am afraid that he is likely to be well and truly harangued by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew) over the coming months, because, to echo my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer), we have a real situation in our city of Leeds, where there is pressure on the greenfield and the green belt, even though 24,000 approvals have been made for brownfield sites. This is putting huge pressure on the local communities and on the amount of resources that Leeds city council is spending on trying to preserve the greenfield and the green belt. I want to suggest a couple of routes for the Minister to investigate. First, will he look at the incentives that we can give house builders to build on brownfield land? The right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn) is no longer in his place, but I think that he would recognise that a huge area of Leeds-I know that this is supported by the hon. Member for Leeds East (Mr Mudie)-needs regeneration. That regeneration is not happening because developers can make a huge amount of money and make vastly greater profits by coming out into my constituency, which is on the edge of Leeds, and building four or five-bedroom houses on greenfield sites, where there is a premium attached because of the countryside views. We can have this argument, but we cannot stop the developers doing that because it falls within the planning laws. Under the Localism Act 2011, Leeds city council is now responsible for bringing in plans to control that area further. We need to be more proactive in incentivising house builders not only to get building, but to do so where we want them to build. I suggest to the Minister for Housing that he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider introducing tax incentives for companies that build on brownfield sites. There are some 24,000 approvals in Leeds, which are ready to go. Those houses can be built, but the house builders are choosing not to build them. They have land-banked the land and could start building tomorrow if they wanted to, but better profits lie elsewhere. We could increase the profitability for companies of building on brownfield sites before greenfield ones. Perhaps we should also look at how section 106 agreements work. That would hopefully address the problem. I put that to the Minister purely as something for him to go away and think about, and to perhaps come back to me on. One of the greatest concerns is the east Leeds extension project, which has been on the books in Leeds for decades. It is getting closer and closer to happening as we speak. Our argument with the house builders is that they want to start building the houses before the new dual-carriageway link to the ring road that is part of the expansion project. That would put intolerable pressure on the existing infrastructure in the area. We need to look at how we can say to house builders, â€œYou cannot build a single house until you have put the infrastructure in place to cope with the new demand.â€When I was a councillor in 2007, we had severe flooding. Towards the bottom of the topography of my constituency, which is at its north end, there is a huge run-off area. The east Leeds extension project proposes to build on the greenfield land that allows that water to soak in. We need to look at a mechanism whereby we can say to the house builder, â€œNot only do you have to build the link to the ring road, but you need to build a storm drain under the development that will carry water away.â€ As I have said, the hon. Member for Leeds East has huge flooding problems that relate to the same area. By working with the community and helping to protect their houses from flooding, we may be able to get this house building moving forward with less resistance, because the community would be able to see the benefits for all. If we are to take pressure off greenfield sites and get some of these 24,000 homes, the vast majority of which are affordable, built on brownfield sites, we must look at the taxation system and section 106 agreements to see whether we can incentivise the house builders to move to those areas before they build on the green fields.",60973,[],Housing,0,79,housing,756
2012-09-05,Housing,397,Alison Seabeck,Lab,False,"I draw the House's attention to my indirect interests, which have been mentioned before in the House. I welcome the new Minister for Housing to the role that I consider to be the most important in government outside the Cabinet. It is arguably more important than several of the recently invented roles in the Cabinet. Yesterday, we saw the end of the tenure of the right hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) in that office. He said that his tenure should be judged on a simple golden rule: if he delivered more homes than were delivered under Labour, he would consider himself a success. On his own test, he has failed. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey) rightly drew attention to the national figures. In the south-west, the number of homes being completed is lower than in 2009, to use the year that the Minister, the former Minister and the Prime Minister have used. That figure is 7% lower this year than it was last year. The knock-on effects are startling and shameful to behold. Statutory homelessness in the south-west is up 15% in the past year and rough sleeping up 24%. Those are the brutal consequences of a Government who, for all their bluster and sunny language, have failed to understand the nature of the housing crisis, set their aspirations low and lacked the will to deliver. Nowhere was that better evidenced than by the Secretary of State and the former Housing Minister willingly offering a 60% cut in the housing budget in the 2010 comprehensive spending review. In its stead we have had a push-me, pull-you approach to affordable housing, with the Department for Work and Pensions reducing housing benefit while the Department for Communities and Local Government's affordable rent model has not only made social housing unaffordable for hard-working families on low incomes but, by the DCLG's own analysis, will increase the housing benefit bill by billions of pounds. We have heard about the bedroom tax, which is also hitting hard-working families, and the council tax benefit cut is coming. Like every other MP, I have people in my surgery who are in tears because they cannot cope with their housing situation. The Government have lacked a joined-up, effective strategic vision for housing provision, and their aspiration of 170,000 new affordable homes is dwarfed by the 256,000 affordable homes that Labour delivered in the last Parliament despite the credit crunch and the global banking crisis. In the past two and a half years, the Government have refused to take the necessary action to deal with a crisis of their own making. The former Housing Minister talked a good talk, but for all the effective media spin, nothing substantial has happened and the numbers keep getting worse. Labour's call for a tax on bankers' bonuses to kick-start the construction industry and deliver an additional 25,000 new homes was rejected by the Government, who instead chose to hand a Â£40,000 tax cut to millionaires. Ask any housing expert and they will say that the only way to get new homes delivered in the right place and of the right size to meet needs is to invest capital. I very much hope that the new Minister, with his understanding of construction and development and an open mind, will consider seriously how he can make the case for capital investment within the Government. My right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford) has given him a good starting point. The Government continue to say that the problem is with planning. Across the country, however, there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of unused planning permissions. Those potential homes are not being built because financial backing is not in place, the banks are not lending and potential buyers cannot get a mortgage. The Government want to open the debate about greenfield land, which is a running sore on their own Benches. Government Members have raised some concerns about it today. However, people across the country whose lives are on hold will continue to pay the price. They are not just families on council waiting lists, dismayed by the Government's decision to stop investing in new homes for social rent, but young professionals who once saw a simple route through renting to home ownership. They now find themselves in insecure rented accommodation in a sector that the Government have refused to regulate. The Government voted against our amendments to the Localism Bill last year that would have given renters greater rights and protections. Last year, the number of homes started in Plymouth was down, and there is a 24-month build time for homes, which is not good enough. Plymouth city council recently wrote to the former Housing Minister asking for a meeting to discuss how we could invest in building 5,000 new homes, including through a significant self-build programme. I hope that the new Minister will agree to meet me and representatives of Plymouth city council. What this country needs now is not a plan B but a plan C-C for â€œcrisisâ€, a crisis caused by the coalition.",60973,[],Housing,0,80,housing,856
2012-09-05,Housing,398,Justin Tomlinson,Con,False,"I welcome the new Ministers to the Front Bench. There have been some excellent contributions to this debate, but I would like to set out some alternative issues that are having an impact on new build sales. I do so on the basis of my time as a councillor from 2000 to 2010-a time of the last Government's house building at any cost, which hit residents' quality of life. My speech will be a whistle-stop summary of some of my concerns. First, the last Government were hell-bent on high density rules, which saw houses packed in at the cost of parking spaces, creating dangerous problems. They also built on valuable open spaces. Following the successful Olympics we rightly hear concerns about school playing fields, yet the last Government were all too happy to build on those useable open spaces, leading to long-term problems of childhood obesity. As councillors, we were also forced to deal with the problems caused by imposed housing targets. My local area of Swindon had already built 20,000 houses over the previous 20 years, making us one of the fastest-growing towns in the country, if not the fastest-growing, but we were told that we would have to find another 36,000 houses over the following 20 years. Such targets create confrontation and delays as angry local residents fight the unapproachable planning system. We had problems that I set out in a ten-minute rule Bill. In new build areas that remained unadopted, residents were paying council tax or street maintenance, yet the developers remained responsible. The developers were often very good when they were selling the houses, but when they had sold the last house, and until the area became adopted, they were all too often poor at maintaining an area. I had estates that had not been maintained for more than 17 years, with work waiting to be done before that area could be adopted, yet residents still had to pay, and that did not encourage people to buy houses in those areas. We have had a growing problem with the service and management charges in new blocks of flats. The rules are that, when the final development of that flat area has been completed, the residents have an opportunity to choose or even set up their own management company. However, many developers in management companies have found a way to delay that point, and residents who were told when buying the house that the service charge would be, for example, Â£1,000 a year, suddenly find the management company making pathetic excuses to hike up the prices, taking valuable money from hard-pressed residents who have no choice but to pay or be taken to court. My hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland) and I urgently request a meeting with the Minister to discuss how we can help such residents, who are increasingly targeted by cowboys who parade themselves as management companies. We have heard much about the banks. Earlier, I challenged the shadow Housing Minister because the previous Government had an ideal opportunity to deal with the banks. They were at the Government's mercy when the Government rightly came to their rescue, and they could have imposed some incentives and direct instructions, particularly to help first-time buyers, who are now finding it difficult to access mortgages.",60973,[],Housing,0,81,housing,551

That would have been my next point, but I am conscious of time, so I will be supremely efficient and simply pay huge tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Meon Valley (George Hollingbery), who covered that point. It is clear that, if the Labour party found itself in Government again and wrecked our triple A credit rating, interest rates would rocket, and we would have a real housing crisis on our hands. Many important issues have been raised today, but I urge Ministers not to forget the importance of addressing quality of life. If we are to restore the long-term appetite for new build housing and new build housing estates, we must improve their reputation. The fear factor is a bit like that experienced when buying a new car in the knowledge that as soon as it is driven off the forecourt, 30% of the value is lost. So many issues put people off going to those new build areas, which have already got planning permission. They should be addressed, because that will help the housing market and, crucially, the long-term quality of life of residents of all ages.",60973,[],Housing,0,83,housing,199
2012-09-05,Housing,401,Bill Esterson,Lab,False,"I commend to the Minister the advice of the Chair of the Select Committee to read the very good report that it prepared on this subject. It gives excellent examples of how to start to tackle the housing crisis. The evidence alone is worth reading for good examples from not only this country but throughout the world that we might embrace. The hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke) talked about the challenges of the green belt from the perspective of representing a seat outside a northern city. I am in a similar position and face threats to every small town and village that I represent. I hope that the Minister will respond to the hon. Gentleman's comments about providing incentives for brownfield development because they are much needed. There are good examples of brownfield sites around the country that were made viable under the Labour Government. Perhaps the Minister will consider what is needed to achieve such development during his tenure. Many of my constituents need housing. Many come to me for help with stories of the difficulties of finding anywhere to rent or buy. In Sefton, there are precious few homes available. In the town where I live, it can take up to eight years for those on the housing list to be given a house. The issue is of huge concern, yet the options are severely limited. Of course people want to stay in the town or village in which they live or grew up and where they have families and friends, and I hope that the Minister will address that. My hon. Friend the shadow Minister referred to the need to look at the local nature of housing need, and that is one of many issues to be resolved. There are many practical actions that the Government could take to help. The borough of Sefton contains 6,000 empty properties, and although VAT on renovations is charged at 20%, there is no VAT on new build properties, which makes it harder to bring empty properties back into use. Encouraging the renovation of empty properties is an important step and would help the economy. The tax on bankers' bonuses is mentioned in the motion, and the proposed construction of 25,000 affordable homes is of great interest. The lack of affordable homes to rent, to buy or for shared ownership is the crucial problem facing my constituents and those of all hon. Members. The Chancellor called for the planning system to be speeded up to help the construction industry, and in an earlier intervention I mentioned the need to use existing planning consents. Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, made the point better than I can: if we are to have the homes that are needed, particularly the affordable homes, we need to use existing planning consents rather than seek more. In Formby in my constituency, a representative from the developer David Wilson Homes told those attending a recent public exhibition about plans to build 300 houses on green-belt land. Hundreds of residents who turned up to the meeting were told that the development would go ahead and that there was nothing they could do about it. That exhibition coincided with the Chancellor's announcement about making planning easier, and the concern is that developers are queuing up to build on the green belt in places such as my constituency-and many other constituencies with rural or semi-rural areas-because it is more attractive and financially more advantageous. I hope that the Minister will listen to hon. Members from across the House who have called for practical suggestions that will protect the green belt as far as possible, and that he will take on board suggestions from members of his own party as well as from the Labour party on solving this very real housing crisis.",60973,[],Housing,0,84,housing,640

Statistics show that the average age of a first-time buyer is 37 years-at the same age, my mother and father had been married and divorced and had two children-and according to Scottish Widows, that age will increase to 44 over the next couple of years. Average rent is Â£725, which is half the monthly wage of an average earner, and it seems that owning or renting a house, or whatever people want, is to become like walking on the moon or flying on a supersonic airline to New York-a thing of the past. This debate has not been helped by the idea that somehow housing benefit is paid out to scroungers. It makes me absolutely sick and mad that the Prime Minister has placed a cap on housing benefit for political ends. He is not targeting people who are out of work; some 95% of the Â£1 billion increase in housing benefit has been paid to people in work. Seven out of eight claimants are people in work. The Government are not attacking those who are jobless; they are attacking those on low incomes. It is all very well to critique the Labour Government and for the Chancellor to appear on the Sunday programmes and say, â€œOh, it's all the fault of the planning regime.â€ I am sorry, but it is now the Government's planning regime and if they have a problem with planning, they should do something about it. I am not going to stand here and say the Labour Government were perfect. We need a quarter of a million new homes a year. If we are building only half that, something has gone wrong. The old ways will not do, so we need innovative measures. The new Housing Minister, who has made the trip from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, spoke about enterprise zones, which can be successful. We have heard from other hon. Members about examples of where house building is working, but in other areas, such as inner-city London and other city areas, there is a problem. Could we introduce some sort of enterprise zone where there are innovative schemes to bring about house building? We could look at an example from France. When an electricity generator is built, those living nearby are compensated by having free electricity. Could we do something along those lines, and provide a new school or medical centre where there is a new housing development? I did some research before the debate and found out about the No Use Empty scheme in Kent, under which 21,000 derelict homes have been refurbished. Can we evolve that? The scheme can give owners Â£25,000 to refurbish buildings, which will encourage other banks to lend. Those are innovative ideas. Time is getting on and I know that somebody else wants to speak, but I will say this: unless we act now, we are saving up problems for the future.",60973,[],Housing,0,85,housing,524
2012-09-05,Housing,403,Austin Mitchell,Lab,False,"We have spent too much time on a tit-for-tat argument about which party has done best by housing. The reality is that both the Conservatives and Labour have done badly by housing, but I proudly say that Labour has done less badly than the Conservatives. I shall make only two points. First, a housing crisis is building up primarily because we need 240,000 new houses a year but are building only around 100,000 a year. In that situation, we need a big housing drive, for two reasons. First, that is the best possible stimulus to an economy that is bumping along the bottom and which drastically needs to be stimulated by the provision of jobs. People need furniture and many other things when they buy a house-and in Grimsby they need pictures of me to put on the wall. We need that stimulus as quickly as possible. The second reason why we need a big drive is to deal with the crisis, but as other hon. Members have indicated, we need housing of a particular type. We need a big drive on public housing for rent-I do not care whether it is social housing or council housing. We need to stimulate both those things for the two fifths of the population who cannot afford to buy at current prices. They will not get mortgages, but they need good housing. We save money on the health service, education, policing and social services by putting them in good housing. That should be the prime focus of the drive. My second point is on how we can raise the money. We could and should issue municipal housing bonds so that local authorities can raise the money and stimulate investment in housing. The return will come from rents in an authority's own area. That is a simple way of doing things. The bonds could even be bought by the Bank of England, just as it buys Government debt for quantitative easing. That is the drive that we need and we could finance it with municipal housing bonds. Those are the two points I wanted to make. I welcome the new Housing Minister to his role, but he has a big job. It is important that he stimulates and begins the big housing drive right now.",60973,[],Housing,0,86,housing,381

We have not seen a failure to deliver on this scale since another Tory-Liberal Government failed to deliver on their promise to build homes fit for heroes for the families of soldiers returning from the horrors of the first world war. Conservative Members used to talk about a property-owning democracy, but many would-be home owners are now trapped in private rented accommodation, paying extremely high rents and unable to build up the very high deposits necessary to secure a mortgage.

If we are to have balanced communities, we need to create a situation in which people in different places on the income scale can live in the same community. What the Government are doing is completely wrong. We have seen a massive fall in affordable home starts and a catastrophic collapse in social housing starts. When I was first elected, I was a member of the Communities and Local Government Committee, and I well remember the ministerial team coming before the Committee. The then Minister for Housing said:â€œWe believe in house building; we believe we've got a better way to get houses built. The idea is to get a system which delivers housing in this country.â€The Secretary of State chipped in, adding:â€œAnd homes that people want to live in so kids can play in the streets and people come home with some pride.â€But they have totally failed to deliver on all the rhetoric on that day and since. In her contribution, my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck) touched on the fact that the Government are failing to deliver. Indeed, every one of the plethora of new initiatives announced by the Government has been an utter failure. As my hon. Friend the shadow Minister for Housing pointed out, in the month following the introduction of the NPPF, planning approvals fell by 37%, which accompanied the loss of 180,000 planning approvals as a result of the meddling in the planning rules by the Secretary of State when he first came to office. That puts into context the cavalier way in which the Government have addressed the whole issue of delivering decent housing. The Government's definition of â€œaffordable housingâ€ means that it is not even affordable to large numbers of people. Indeed, the ministerial announcements that we are seeing on various new housing initiatives would not have been out of place if they had appeared in George Orwell's â€œNineteen Eighty-Fourâ€ as the product of the Ministry of Truth. Perhaps we should rename the Department for Communities and Local Government. The reason we face this massive housing crisis today is the abject failure of the coalition parties' economic plan. They have cut housing investment at precisely the wrong time and, as a consequence, the construction industry is on its knees. It is a very labour-intensive industry and it could create huge numbers of jobs. Moreover, 80% of the products on a building site are procured from inside the United Kingdom.

What do the Government do in response to this huge and growing crisis and massive demand for housing? Rather than build the homes that people need, they tinker with measures that deny housing benefit to people under 25, inflict a crude housing benefit cap and impose a bedroom tax on people deemed to be under-occupying their homes, forcing people up to the age of 35 to live in a single room if they happen to be on a low income. The human cost of the calamity with which we are faced as a consequence of the failure of the Government's economic and housing policies is tragic and shameful. More people are homeless as a direct consequence of their policies, and more people are having to sleep on the street-as I mentioned, rough sleeping is increasing. This is completely unacceptable in the 21st century in one of the richest nations on the planet. I just hope that the new Housing Minister is not blinded by the failed ideology that resulted in the abject failure of his predecessor. The country is crying out for, and demands, real action now, not more meaningless initiatives. We need a clear plan, because plan A has totally failed. The new Minister said that he was committed to increasing housing supply. I hope that he can deliver on that.

It has been constructive and timely in a number of ways-from my personal point of view and in terms of the Government's programme-and I would like to congratulate right hon. and hon. Members on what has been a genuinely positive and constructive debate. I want to respond to some of the positive ideas raised, because it is an important part of my learning curve and so that we can tackle a problem with which, as several Members have said, many Governments have been faced. The hyperbolic contributions from Opposition Members do not help us to find a meaningful and lasting solution. I have already outlined the steps that the Government have taken to address the previous Government's failure to deliver sufficient housing supply. I want now to address some of the specific points that have been raised and that Members have asked me to touch on. After that, I shall conclude in the time left to me. We began with the contribution from the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts), who, to be fair, accepted that the Labour Government failed in several areas. I accept the point about self-build, however, and want to consider it further, because it is an interesting idea. Several Select Committee members have recommended that I read their report. I do not know whether they are on a bonus or chasing a sales target, but I am more than happy to look at it, because it is an important issue. I draw attention, in particular, to the contribution from my good friend, my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill). I would like to put on the record my personal tribute to him. The House knows that he was a hard-working Minister, experienced and courteous to the House-a lesson that I shall try to follow. He worked on Ebbsfleet, as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), where 23,000 houses went un-built in the 13 years of the last Labour Government. My hon. Friend ensured that those houses can now be built. He was right to say that Labour Front Benchers are unfortunately suffering from what one can only describe as collective amnesia. Now they talk highly about helping our councils, but they forget that they spent 13 years trammelling local councils and preventing them from doing what they want to do. We are changing that; that is what the Localism Act 2011 is all about. I thought the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs Riordan) was a little negative. She omitted to mention the contributions in transportation, infrastructure investment or the Â£770 million in the Growing Places fund-if I may, I shall come back briefly to discuss Halifax in a moment. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) highlighted the fact that this is a long-term issue. She asked about the empty homes package, which is a package of Â£160 million. I am pleased to say that we are scrapping the old top-down pathfinder targets, which sought to demolish houses. We are looking to ensure that we refurbish them. I also very much welcome her comments about the new homes bonus. A number of Members mentioned social housing issues. I will want to look at them, but to do so in the two minutes I have left would be to treat them inadequately, as they are deep and sustained issues. Let me turn the underlying economic issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Meon Valley (George Hollingbery) hit the nail on the head. He was absolutely right to say that we have recognised that ensuring that we deal with the deficit is what keeps interest rates low. For many of our constituents-indeed, for millions of households-ensuring that interest rates remain lower for longer is vital to their being able to continue to afford their homes. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey) talked about how the new Gateway site is a good example of a project that is progressing. The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford) is an experienced Member in this field. We disagree on a number of areas, and he will not be surprised to know that the new homes bonus is one of them. Indeed, he might like to know-he might also wish to debate this with the hon. Member for Halifax-that Calderdale council is receiving Â£1.7 million from that bonus for 550 new builds. I suspect that there may be an element of tension on the Labour Back Benches. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer) talked about the important issue of ensuring that brownfield sites are developed, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke). Getting the balance right between greenfield and brownfield sites is difficult. Wearing my old surveyor's hat, I want to look at the issue further. As a practitioner, I dealt with how we regenerate brownfield sites back in the 1980s and 1990s. I want to look at the issue, and I would ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to write to me about it. Let me turn, finally, to a couple of the last points that were raised. My hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) was absolutely right that we are determined to ensure that we get house building numbers right, and that we should develop and build on that and reverse the problems we faced under the last Labour Government. However, we should not ignore quality. That is an important point. Quality and design; places that people want to live in; the use of the vernacular-these are important as we think about how to ensure that we provide the appropriate homes. To conclude, the Government are working hard to increase substantially the supply of housing from the low point of the last Labour Government. Our housing strategy combines practical measures with an understanding that Whitehall cannot and must not try to control the housing markets. Our work in helping first-time buyers, simplifying the planning system and unlocking stalled sites is all part of our commitment to enable more homes to be built. By tackling the deficit we have built the foundation for a sustainable economy. We are now focused on getting houses built.",60973,[],Housing,0,93,housing,1057

Before I begin, let me say that I thought that Mr Speaker spoke for all of us earlier in his eloquent and moving tribute to our dear friend and comrade Paul Goggins. His death is a tragedy. He was as decent, compassionate, principled and, I have to say, cheerful a man as one could have the privilege to meet, and we will miss him dreadfully. Our hearts go out to Wyn and to their three children, Matthew, Theresa and Dominic. The fact that we face a housing crisis is common ground across the House. Why do we face that crisis? Because people are living longer and staying in their own homes, which is a good thing; because our population is rising; because every relationship breakdown increases the demand for housing; but principally because, as a society, we have not been building enough homes. Whether we look at starts, completions or net housing supply, the failure to build over the past three years could not be more starkly obvious. It is good to see the Secretary of State taking part in today's debate. By my count, he has participated in at least four major housing launches, and his Department has made nearly 400 announcements about housing in the past three years. I have brought some of them along. They are headed â€œBuilding more homesâ€, â€œWelcome rise in affordable housingâ€, â€œPlans to boost UK housebuildingâ€, and â€œPrevention is best cure for homelessnessâ€. This is the question that the Secretary of State should answer: is he proud of his record over those three years? The Secretary of State's Department tells us that an average of 232,000 new households will be formed in England each year over the next two decades. However, in the three years for which he has been in charge, the number of homes completed in England has fallen to its lowest level since Stanley Baldwin was first Prime Minister.

The truth is we need to build a lot more homes as a country-roughly double the current rate. The question before the House today is not whether we are now seeing a rise in housing starts from the pitifully low level the Government have bequeathed themselves over the last three years. The question before the House today is: does the country have a plan that will see building on the scale required? Judging by the record so far, the answer is clearly no, and there is one bit of advice I suggest the Secretary of State takes, which he himself gave: he did at least have the modesty to put out one press release which was headed: â€œNo complacency in the drive to build more homes.â€The Secretary of State should listen to the plans and proposals Labour have put forward about what more needs to be done. Let us consider affordable homes. What did the Government do? One of their first acts was to cut the affordable housing budget by 60%. Indeed, it was the largest cut they made. We have tried to persuade them to use the proceeds of the 4G auction to build affordable homes and to listen to the International Monetary Fund calling for an infrastructure boost by providing more affordable homes. They have not done that. I come now to the new homes bonus. The National Audit Office said there is little evidence that the bonus has significantly changed local authorities' behaviour, and the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee says there is no credible data available to show whether it is working. Indeed, she has pointed out that the areas that have gained most money tend to be the areas where housing need is lowest and the areas that have lost most money tend to be those where the needs are greatest. That is a familiar story with this Government: whether it is local government funding or the new homes bonus, they like to take from those who are least well-off and give to those who are most well-off. What is more, the money that is taken from the least well-off goes to areas where in all probability the houses would have been built anyway, so in what sense is the new homes bonusâ€œa powerful incentive for local authorities to deliver housingâ€? We know the new Housing Minister, the hon. Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins), does not think it is an incentive because he told us so. On 25 November he told the House thatâ€œthe new homes bonus is not about encouraging people to build homes.â€- That is what he said. If that is the case, what on earth is the new homes bonus for?

We cannot boost demand for housing, which is what Help to Buy is doing, if we do not also increase the supply. There is a growing list of voices expressing concern about the scheme, the latest of which belongs to someone who happens to sit at the Cabinet table with the Secretary of State. I refer, of course, to the Business Secretary.

We have called on the Bank of England to look into the operation of the Help to Buy scheme now, rather than in a year's time, precisely so that those points can be taken on board. I want to move on to discuss what else could be done to get the land, the finance and the planning consent required to build more homes. Ministers seem to argue that nothing is really wrong with the way in which the land market is working. I have to say to the Secretary of State that we disagree. The planning Minister, in his latest written answer to me, has said there are more than 523,000 units with planning permission, of which 241,500 have not yet even been started on site. That represents a lot of homes that could be built, yet companies are sitting on the land, with planning permission, waiting for it to increase in value and not building on it. The Office of Fair Trading looked into this matter and found that strategic land banks, including optioned land, were worth 14.3 years, which is about enough land to build 1.4 million homes. That is why we think it perfectly reasonable for communities that have given planning permission to say to those who sought it, â€œLook, will you please get on and build the homes you said you wanted to build? And if you don't, then after a time we will start levying a charge. After all, if you had built them, we would now be getting council tax revenue. In the most extreme cases, we will use compulsory purchase powers to take the land off you, with the permission, and sell it to someone else who will build the homes.â€I know that Ministers spluttered into their Cornflakes when we announced that policy, and that the Mayor of London described it as a â€œMugabe-styleâ€ land grab, but I would gently point out that among those who support the idea of charging when permission has been granted but no houses have been built are the International Monetary Fund and someone who goes by the name of Boris Johnson, who, when I last checked, was the Mayor of London. Moreover, the planning Minister once called for a tax on land to â€œdeter speculative land banksâ€. The hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen has also spoken up in favour of the proposal, and the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi) has tried to claim it as a Conservative idea.

Secondly, she found thatâ€œmany housebuilders â€˜trickle out' houses...to protect themselves against price volatilityâ€. Hon. Members say that that was a decade ago, but it is still going on.

The Government used to be very keen on those at one point, but they seem to have become less enthusiastic. I hope that the Secretary of State will say something about that when he responds, because it is hard to see how we will make progress without those things . We have to incentivise local authorities to come forward, which is why the Lyons commission is going to look at how we can help new towns and garden cities to be established and why a Labour Treasury would use guarantees-the Government are currently using guarantees for Help to Buy-for â€œhelp to buildâ€ for these new towns. Finally, we need communities to take responsibility for building new homes. On that I am with the planning Minister, because I believe that neighbourhood planning is the way forward. For too long, we have had a system in which nobody has really taken responsibility for building new homes. Thame in south Oxfordshire provides a good example of the new community plan. If communities feel that the new houses that they give consent to will solve the housing problem in their own neighbourhood, they will be much more likely to give agreement. That is why we need plots for self-build and local allocation policies for social housing, and why we need to give local people first call on having the chance to buy new developments in their area. That will give communities confidence that the homes will meet their need. The progress so far has not been considerable, but the task is. I do not know whether the Secretary of State in the end believed all his press releases and announcements, I do not know whether he thought that blaming councils would be enough and I do not know whether he was taken in by what I have to describe as the bombast of this Government's first Housing Minister, who boasted consistently of the Government's record. The problem is that the Secretary of State's record speaks all too clearly for itself. Therefore, the country needs a new plan. The public need it because they are the ones paying the price for failure. Homes give us security and a sense of community: they are where we build and raise families; they are places for children to do their homework; and they are good for our health.

It is a shame that Labour councillors and Labour MPs oppose the right to buy. Who is the biggest enemy of the right to buy? It is Labour-supporting unions such as Unite, the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians and the GMB, waging class war against the working classes. By contrast, we are on the side of hard-working people. We have changed the rules on housing waiting lists to give priority to the armed forces and to local residents, whereas Labour doled out council housing to foreign nationals.

The average length of time households spend in temporary accommodation has fallen by a third.

2014-01-08,Housing,288,Eric Pickles,Con,False,"My hon. Friend makes a very important point and I shall come on to it in a few moments. We have scrapped Labour's regional spatial strategies, which enveloped the planning system in red tape and hindered local plan making. The number of planning appeals has fallen, meaning more local decision making and more decisions â€œright first timeâ€. At the same time, we have protected the environment. The latest official figures, produced last month, show that the number of homes built on the green belt is the lowest on record-four times lower than it was a quarter of a century ago. We have made it easier to get brownfield land back into use by allowing surplus office space to be converted into homes. A survey in September of just 15% of councils reported more than 260 different schemes under those new rights, but the Labour response, from Labour MPs and from members of the London Assembly, is to oppose those new homes. We are not just backing large developers-we are supporting self-build by abolishing development taxes such as section 106 and the community infrastructure levy, getting the state off the backs of those who want to build their own homes. I hope that the hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams) will welcome that. Labour's response has been silence, no doubt because Labour councils want to tax people to the hilt. We need only to look at Labour's policies, which we have heard about from the right hon. Member for Leeds Central. Labour has a five-year plan and has reinstated a national housing target of 200,000 homes a year. The previous Labour Government had a target of 240,000 homes a year, yet house building fell to its worst peacetime level since the 1920s. It is a little like the state targets for the tractors that failed to roll off the Ukrainian production lines. How would Labour build new homes? I understand the Opposition have three policies. First, the shadow Housing Minister has called for five â€œnew townsâ€. I remind her that the last Labour Prime Minister promised five new eco-towns in 2007, and then, when they were not built-perhaps in a silent, unconscious tribute to Nikita Khrushchev-increased the number from five to 10. Not a single house was built. Not one. The only thing that eco-towns built was resentment. Labour has simply dusted off and reheated its old policies under a different name. The Government are supporting locally led large scale development, with more than Â£500 million of investment. We have kick-started new homes in the likes of Cranbrook, Wokingham and Sherford, and Ebbsfleet will follow very soon. Labour's next policy is so-called land banking, as we have just heard, and is a solution to a problem that does not exist, according to the Office of Fair Trading, Savills and Kate Barker. Of the half a million units with outstanding planning permission, almost 90% have started or are working towards a start. The number of homes on stalled sites is just 59,000 units. The Get Britain Building investment fund, worth more than Â£500 million, is helping unlock those sites, and we have made things easier by enabling unrealistic section 106 agreements to be renegotiated, making such stalled sites viable-a move opposed every single time by the Labour party.",65061,[],Housing,0,80,housing,549

2014-01-08,Housing,290,Eric Pickles,Con,False,"Perhaps we could nationalise them- I thought that would get the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr Campbell) excited. Perhaps we should confiscate the land.

Labour's policy of new development taxes and state confiscation of land would have the reverse effect of that desired, discouraging developers from complex land assembly projects. House builders will just let their planning permissions lapse or be more cautious about applying for permission in the first place. It is a recipe for fewer homes and a slower planning system. Labour's third policy is the right to grow, another Labour land grab to allow Labour councils to dump urban sprawl on their rural neighbours and rip up green belt protection. Labour cites the likes of Stevenage-we have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland)-Oxford and York.

It has even asked Sir Michael Lyons to come up with a couple more. Under the Labour Government, Sir Michael was paid Â£400,000 for his last review of Department for Communities and Local Government policy, so I hope that the Labour party is getting him at a cheaper rate. For all Labour's lame attempts at policy making, we can see what Labour would be like in reality, as my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies) suggested. In Wales, where housing is devolved, Labour runs the Administration, and its record on housing there is a disaster. According to the National House-Building Council, while new home registrations are up in England, they have fallen successively in Wales. Labour has hit the housing market with extra red tape, adding Â£13,000 to the cost of a new home with measures ranging from building regulations, to fire sprinklers and waste site management plans. House builders Redrow say that owing to the burden of regulation:â€œWales is the most difficult area in the UK in which to operateâ€. Persimmon Homes has pulled out of development in south Wales and the construction firm Watkin Jones has shifted its development to England rather than Wales. Labour failed to support the housing market, and has belatedly introduced a help to buy equity loan scheme. Watkin Jones said thatâ€œit is difficult to comprehend why the Welsh Assembly Government are failing to recognise the importance of following the UK Government's lead in getting much needed homes built.â€The Welsh Government, true to Labour form, have slashed right to buy. In microcosm, this is the real face of Labour: high tax, high regulation, the enemy of the free market, and the enemy of aspiration. I have outlined how the coalition Government's long-term economic plan is turning the housing market around, but there is more to do to build more homes to meet demand and deal with demographic change. The next spending round will see a further Â£23 billion of public and private investment in affordable housing. We are looking at further reforms to the housing revenue account to help councils build more homes. Our Â£1 billion build to rent fund is bringing institutional investment into the private rented sector-something that no Government have achieved before. Further change of use reforms will make it easier for redundant and under-used buildings to be converted to housing. We will deliver fairness in social housing by ending taxpayer subsidies to high-income social tenants-people like Bob Crow. Our economic plan is for the long term. Contrary to the doom and gloom of the Labour party, which wants to talk our nation down, our economy is on the mend, thanks to the hard work of the British people, and thanks to tough decisions to tackle the deficit left by Labour and to clean up their mess. Our policy is firing up the kilns, bringing the brickies on site, and getting Britain building again. I urge right hon. and hon.

I remember-this is going back a long time; I have been here 26 years-that when we came to power in 1997 on the back of 18 years of Tory rule, houses were crumbling and falling to bits. If Members look at the record, they will see that in that period Labour put at least Â£9 billion or Â£10 billion into refurbishing houses. In my constituency, I remember new kitchens and bathrooms going in, and new roofs going on the houses. A lot of work was done, so when the Secretary of State knocks the Labour Government, he should remember what they did to refurbish houses that were neglected in the previous 18 years of the Tory Government. I want to talk about Northumberland. The county council has a waiting list of 10,000 people. It is not a big area, but it is rural and sparsity is an issue. A lot of houses are needed in the countryside and there is a big problem, as the Secretary of State said. There are not many brownfield sites in the countryside, and in extreme circumstances we may have to use green-belt areas, as has been said. There is always a problem in the countryside, because it does not want houses to be built, so there is a big demonstration about it. I do not know where the kids are going to live-sometimes we have to put houses in the countryside. Northumberland county council has a plan to build 2,000 houses a year, which would constitute 300 jobs a year. That would put a lot of money into the economy-the council reckons Â£10 million, if it can get the programme going. The only problem is that, at this moment in time, it is completing 191 affordable houses. I do not have a problem with Help to Buy-if young people have a bit of money and want to buy their own home, that is their right-but we need houses for the poor and those people who cannot, even with Help to Buy, afford to buy. We need to build homes for them. There are 10,000 people on the waiting list in Northumberland, which has a population of only 300,000, and there is a problem with people trying to get houses. Under the county's core strategy, at least 30% of the 2,000 houses that it is trying to build will be affordable for poor people who cannot afford to buy a home on their own. There are three sites in my constituency where building is under way. I am going tomorrow to have my photograph taken at one where the last house is just being finished-I will be proud to see it, as it is an affordable house. Something is being done, but it is very, very little-it is not enough-and the engine needs to go faster and faster so that we can build more. We have land in Amble, Berwick, Corbridge, Craster, Embleton, Shilbottle, Rothbury and Wooler. They are not in Blyth-I am in the big town-but in the countryside, where we have land to build. One or two sites might encroach on the green belt, but not by very much, and Northumberland county council really does not want to use that land, as it wants to build houses where they are needed. They are needed in those places in the countryside. I hear Members saying, â€œYou can't build in villages; you can't build here,â€ but we have to build in villages, as they have to survive.

2014-01-08,Housing,296,Mark Pawsey,Con,False,"It is entirely right that we should debate the serious issue of housing this afternoon, but I am afraid that the Opposition have picked the wrong time to table a motion with such wording, as it does not reflect the state of the market, which is decidedly upbeat. However, those words might have been appropriate in 2010, when under Labour house building fell to its lowest level for nearly 100 years and Labour was consistently breaking promises on what it would do regarding housing. I took the trouble to read the 2007 conference speech made by the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)-his first speech after becoming Prime Minister-in which he promised that Labour would provide 240,000 new homes a year. The following year, the figure for new homes was 115,000-the lowest since the 1920s. Labour said that it would build eco-homes, and it kicked off with five communities, which went up to 10. That was going to be the centrepiece of its housing policy, but none of the communities was ever built or developed. Labour presided over a period of regional spatial strategies, with a top-down â€œcentral Government know bestâ€ system, but that simply failed to push forward land for development. The words in the motion are wrong, because things are starting to happen with housing. The Government's policies have begun to bear fruit, and nationally nearly 400,000 new homes have been delivered since 2010, and starts are up by 23%. The improvement applies not only to owner occupation: 99,000 affordable homes have been delivered since 2011, which is halfway towards delivering the 170,000 homes that the Government seek to deliver by 2015. The Government's initiatives to encourage home ownership are working. The Help to Buy scheme, which was launched in April 2013, is allowing people to get started on the housing ladder. There were 5,000 sales in the first six months and 1,000 house builders are registered. The importance of small and medium-sized developers has already been mentioned, and some 90% of the developers registered under Help to Buy are small or medium-sized companies. There are now 11 lenders covering the scheme. We are also meeting the aspirations of those in the social housing sector who wish to buy their own home by invigorating the right to buy. My constituency is in the middle of England, and it sits in the middle of many statistics. In 2010, the number of new builds in Rugby fell by 62%, which was inconsistent with the level across the country as a whole, but in 2012-13, housing starts in the constituency increased by 260% to their highest level since 2007-08. Included in those figures is the gateway development of Eden Park, which the Housing Minister visited last February, where three developers are building 1,400 new homes-and selling them as fast as they can build them. The positive attitude to development in my constituency is reflected by an application for 6,200 new homes that will come before the local authority's planning committee tomorrow, so things are moving across the country, especially in my constituency. What would have happened if Labour was in power? With regard to measures on land banking, we have heard about state confiscation.

We are facing a housing crisis that has been preceded by 30 years of housing neglect due to 18 years of disinvestment under the Conservatives and 13 years of inadequate investment under Labour, simply because there were other priorities at the time, such as education and the health service. We have since had four years of cuts and low-level production. Members have talked about levels of house building not seen since Stanley Baldwin's time, but when the Government came into office, why did they not seize the opportunity to boost the economy by building houses, as was done in the 1930s-in Stanley Baldwin's time-as a means of recovering from recession?",65061,[],Housing,0,91,housing,167

We did a good job on decent homes and a limited job on home building, but it was just not enough, given the scale of the problem. Our present commitment is to build 200,000 houses, which I welcome. However, I argue that we also need a commitment to more public housing for rent. Let us talk not about affordable housing, because it never is affordable, but about public housing for rent, because that provides for the greatest need. Two fifths of the population-the figure is higher in some parts of the country, especially London-simply cannot afford to buy and cannot raise the money for a mortgage without long years of struggle or winning the national lottery. Those are the people who we need to help. We need a big build of public housing for rent to provide for their needs, and that is also needed to bring down the housing benefit bill, because the reason why it is now so high is that we have not built council and social housing, which is much cheaper to provide. The Government's proposals, inadequate and belated as they are, will make things worse because increasing the discounts on the sale of council houses means reducing the stock of available housing to meet people's needs. That policy will certainly not generate enough revenue to pay for new building. We should have a rule that every council house sold must be replaced by a new one. If we had introduced such a sensible provision from the start, we would have maintained the housing stock. The fact is that private sector build has not risen to 200,000 for many years. According to Shelter, its highest ever total was 175,000. We need a more public housing for rent, which we always had in the past. We could provide for that by removing the cap on local authority borrowing and channelling money into contracts to build. We could ease the situation-perhaps as with the Bank of England's quantitative easing-by helping the housing associations, which currently face huge problems with arrears, largely because of the bedroom tax. They need help, so they must be allowed to revalue their stock so that they can raise money. Contrary to what the Secretary of State said, all the evidence points to a need for a massive attempt to build public housing for rent, which would energise the economy and put people back to work. That is the only way out of a crisis resulting from 30 years of neglect and house building rates well below the target that we need, which is 240,000 a year.",65061,[],Housing,0,93,housing,438
2014-01-08,Housing,302,Alec Shelbrooke,Con,False,"I will focus my remarks on my constituency and on Leeds. The housing stock obviously needs to be increased, but I have taken issue with the Leeds core strategy and the amount of housing it says needs to be built over the next 15 years. The university of Leeds-that august institution is in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn)-has stated that building 70,000 houses in Leeds would not be completed until 2060, which raises the question: why should they be built over the next 15 years? There is therefore an argument to be had about housing figures in different parts of the country. I totally disagree with the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr Campbell), who is no longer in his place, about villages needing to expand to cope with the housing crisis. One of the major pieces of legislation that this Government have brought in introduces neighbourhood plans, which allow people in the villages in a local area to say, â€œIf we want our village to survive-the little local shop to carry on, the pub to survive, continued use of the village hall, and so on-we need to invest in housing.â€ People in some of my villages may feel that we need more bungalows for elderly people, while those in other villages may feel that there is not enough affordable housing and that we need to build two-bedroom terraced homes that would help young people to stay in the village where they were brought up. The problem that we have in Leeds and in my constituency is that as soon as these plans are proposed, the developer says, â€œWell, that's very good, but actually I want to build not 20 houses there but 200 or 400 houses.â€ That would completely change the nature of the villages in my constituency. Leeds city council has deemed that the constituency overall has to take 1,200 houses. If we put that in the context of there being 41,000 houses to start with, we can see that it represents an enormous expansion. Under these plans, the villages of Micklefield and Kippax and the town of Garforth will all blend into one huge development. I believe that the figures are wrong, as I said when I gave evidence on the core strategy, and if I had more time I would expand on that. However, the local authority has the power to identify more sensibly where larger-scale developments could go. I am unashamed to say on the record that I support the idea of freeing up land in the northern part of my constituency in an area called Headley Fields, which is out towards the parish of Bramham, the village that I reside in, although nowhere near it. That land could take the housing allocation for the next 15 years proposed by Leeds city council. Because it was there and could be planned from day one, proper infrastructure such as transport facilities, pubs, schools, and doctors surgeries could be put in place. At the moment we face the problem of 5,000 houses coming in through what I call death by a thousand cuts-putting 400 houses into a village here and 400 houses into a village there. That would mean that not enough would come out of the new homes bonus to provide the extra facilities, such as the local schools, that were needed. I do not believe that we should build garden cities, but there is certainly an argument for building new villages in areas and not expanding the existing villages. Planning as a whole in order to have the necessary facilities built in those villages is a better way forward than adding developments on to each village. The neighbourhood plans that this Government have empowered local communities to use can then be put into full effect.",65061,[],Housing,0,94,housing,637

When we talk about housing, we are not just talking about building new family homes, important though that is; it is also incredibly important to realise that a lack of housing supply hits the most vulnerable the most. I want to say a few words about the place where I live, was born, grew up, went to school, and now represent-Luton-and why I believe that it is time for radical action. In Luton, through to 2030, we will require some 23,500 to 33,500 new dwellings. That is an enormous number. It points to the fact that Luton is a town with a young population and large families and has a large population that has increased through the migration of successive generations. It has always had to look just beyond its boundaries in order to expand. That process has ground to a halt, and we are facing serious challenges. There is limited capacity regarding developable land in Luton. We reckon we could squeeze in about 6,000 homes in the next 15 to 20 years, but we have to balance that against other competing needs. What is the point of a house without a job to go with it? How do we provide good-quality green space? We have a massive problem with primary school allocation that will become a massive problem with secondary school allocation. We need to build new schools, let alone new houses. This is where the challenge arises, and I can appreciate it because I hear about it in many of the places that I visit. I am a Labour activist, and I sometimes share the frustration about our record in government in delivering more homes. However, people forget that, from 1997 to 2010 across the six counties in the east of England, we built the equivalent of a seventh county in terms of housing, and that was still not enough to keep up with the demand that existed. It is important that we have new towns, garden cities, and so on, but, particularly in the south-east of England, we need to grapple with the problem whereby towns feel that they are unable to expand when we know that there is a great social need for them to do so. That is why I welcome the proposals made by Labour Front Benchers on the right to grow, which would give local authorities powers that they otherwise would not have. It is very different from a top-down solution such as the former regional spatial strategies that set a specific target.

That is why we should bring in a right to grow in conjunction with the pendulum swinging back towards using brownfield first. These things are not rocket science, but there is political ideology behind them. That is why the Secretary of State's dismissal of our proposals was so short-sighted. We all recognise that we need more housing and further housing growth. That requires a mechanism that balances the requirements of local authorities to deliver for the people in their borough boundaries with the need to be good neighbours as well. Ministers are scaremongering about greenfield sites being used, but that would take place within the context of the existing national planning framework. If we are to find a workable solution to many of the problems we face in allowing towns to expand, we will need to have an overall mechanism, but this Government have put in place a series of different mechanisms. They try one, try the other, try the next, change the rules, issue a press release and make an announcement, but we have not seen the delivery, and that is because it is hard to do this stuff.

It was very easy to do that because there was no local consultation, no involvement of local democracy, no hassle, and no localism. I want to hear a little from Labour Front Benchers about the strong tension between the words in their motion about creating new towns and their recent paper-thin conversion to a commitment to localism. I also want to hear from Labour Front Benchers, as I heard from the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Austin Mitchell), a word of apology. In the 13 years that Labour were in Government, Stockport lost 2,683 social homes and none were built in their place, and 421,000 homes were lost from the social housing stock across the whole of England, which the hon. Gentleman, to his credit, pointed out. At the height of the boom in 2003, 90,000 homes were lost. In 2004, 71,000 were lost and in 2005 the figure was 69,000. In those three years alone, 230,000 social homes for rent-a quarter of a million homes-were lost from the housing stock. That took the number of homes in the social rented sector below 4 million for the first time since 1955. At that time, the current shadow Chancellor was telling us that there should be less regulation of banks and the then Prime Minister was telling us, solemnly and repeatedly, that he had got rid of boom and bust. He turned out to be 50% right: he had got rid of the boom. It would be good to hear a word of apology for not just the housing situation we inherited, but the financial situation, too. The coalition Government have started to put things right. Our Â£4.5 billion investment programme is delivering social homes for rent at only half the public subsidy required under Labour. Labour took us below the 4 million homes mark nine years ago. It took another six years of Labour Government to take us a further 72,000 homes below that, but I am very pleased indeed that it has taken three years for the coalition Government to bring them back.",65061,[],Housing,0,98,housing,382

As every expert, academic and, indeed, politician recognises, if we want growth in housing overall, there has to be growth in social housing. Labour blew its chance to deliver that and it is the coalition that is creating the opportunity for it to happen. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said, this country now has a policy whereby, when a social home is sold, another will be built in its place. He would be right to say that it takes a little while to get the planning permission and other stuff in place, but the policy and the delivery of it are there. I ask the groaners on the Opposition Benches: where was that policy during their 13 years? Some 400,000 homes were lost and no attempt whatever was made to replace them, leaving the waiting list at a record level. As the Secretary of State reported, it has now, thank goodness, dropped. The Liberal Democrat influence on this coalition Government means that we are delivering more social homes and, at the end of this Parliament, we will have an increased stock, not a reduced stock, which is exactly what Labour left us with-a reduction of 421,000.

They cannot afford the rising prices or the rising rents. That is this country's housing crisis. I challenge the Secretary of State with the comments made by his then Housing Minister to the Communities and Local Government Committee three years ago, when he said that the â€œgold standardâ€ on which the Government would be judged was building more homes than were being built before the recession. The Government have been building about half the number of homes that were built before the recession. However they choose to dress up the figures, they have failed by their own standards. As some of my colleagues have said, that is not a terribly hard standard to meet, because the Labour Government did not build enough homes. We built more homes than this Government are building, but we did not build enough.

2014-01-08,Housing,311,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"Absolutely, and that brought great delight to many tenants up and down the country. The Government can pray in aid the fact that with the fallout from the banking crisis the private housing sector in this country suffered a decline in demand, but they compounded the problem by cutting the social housing budget by 60%. The right hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Sir Andrew Stunell) was at that time a Minister in the Government who allowed that to happen, and he should stand up and apologise for it. The reality is that the cut was 60%. Government expenditure as a whole was cut by 20%, but social housing capital expenditure was singled out for the biggest cut of all major Government programmes, which has compounded the problem. I welcome the Labour leadership's commitment to move towards building 200,000 homes in this country by 2020. That is a good commitment, but I want to see it go further in the longer term: we must get to 250,000 to get demand and supply back in sync. The reality is that the construction industry in this country is now in such a mess that it could not respond more quickly to a higher target: prices of bricks and labour are already going up in the industry, because it has got down to such a low level. It is therefore realistic to set that target. The issue is that the private sector in this country, as has already been said, has never built consistently more than 150,000 homes. If we are to get up to a figure of 200,000, a large part of that must come from the social housing sector, from local authorities and housing associations. To enable that to happen, we will have to spend some public money. We must all recognise that: if this is a crisis that is a priority for us to deal with, some public expenditure will have to go in as well. I hope that we can get to a general situation in which we recognise that to achieve the stabilisation of house prices and rents, as has happened in Germany, housing supply has to meet housing demand in the long term. To achieve that will require the sort of cross-party agreement that we had in the 1960s and 1970s, when successive Governments of different political persuasions built the homes that the country needed. I hope that we can get back to such a situation. I want to refer to my Select Committee's 2012 report on â€œFinancing of new housing supplyâ€, in which we considered and proposed the idea of a housing bank, with guarantees for institutional investment to go into the social housing and private housing sectors. I recognise that the Government have gone a little way towards that, but not sufficiently. That has been done in the Netherlands; why can we not do it here? Instead of giving guarantees for mortgages, let us put them into building homes. We could take the cap off local authority borrowing, and 60,000 homes could be built immediately. I think that that has cross-party support in the House, so why do the Government not do that? It would not cost any more taxpayers' money, and it could be done instantly. We could look at the housing grant paid to housing associations, which lies on their books as a debt. If it was released tomorrow and that grant was written off-again, there would be no cost to the Treasury, because it has already been paid out-we could free up housing associations' ability to borrow and build more homes as well. We could look at self-build, which is the hidden element in a potential housing renewal. The Government could go to see what has been done in the Netherlands, where there is not so much self-building as self-constructing, which involves getting local authorities to lay out sites and getting planners involved on a simple basis. They could go to see how people in the Netherlands, often with the involvement of small builders, are building their own homes-the homes they want, because they have designed them-at about 80% of the cost of a house bought from a private developer. That could be another element. There is no one silver bullet, but the report includes several measures which, if the Government implemented them straight away, would help to remove the immediate problems of the housing crisis and set us in the right direction.",65061,[],Housing,0,103,housing,740
2014-01-08,Housing,312,Annette L Brooke,LibDem,False,"I will be very brief, but I want to pick up the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Sir Andrew Stunell) about the good initiatives taken by this Government. The fact is that there are more social homes than when we took office in 2010. Progress has been made, and one could rattle off the many good things that have been introduced. They include, for example, encouragement for empty homes to be brought back into use, which is a win-win situation. There is also the whole concept of neighbourhood planning-really involving communities in making important decisions that will increase the supply of housing. Obviously, however, there is more to do. I appreciate that the limit on the housing revenue account has been raised, but I want the borrowing cap to be raised for all councils. I would like more initiatives to increase land supply. There was a pledge to pilot community land auctions, and I would be interested to know what progress has been made on them. There are therefore innovative things that we can do. The answer is not to knock the very good work that has been done, but to accept that there is consensus on tackling our real housing crisis, and on the fact that by tackling it we can contribute to economic growth and create important jobs and apprenticeships for young people. We can create a win-win situation.",65061,[],Housing,0,104,housing,238
2014-01-08,Housing,313,Emma Reynolds,Lab,False,"It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. We have had a wide-ranging discussion about housing, which is an issue that is close to the hearts of many of my constituents and important to people across the country. It is patently clear that the Government are in complete denial about two things: the scale of the housing crisis that we face and the scale of their failure to tackle that crisis. I was astonished that the Secretary of State came here today to tell us that we should rejoice in the â€œsustained turnaroundâ€ in the housing market. His statements fly in the face of the facts. Last year, only 107,000 homes were completed. That is not even half the number of homes that is needed to keep up with demand according to the figures of his own Department. It is regrettable that the Government are presiding over the lowest level of house building in peacetime since the 1920s. If the current trends were to continue, there would be a breathtaking housing shortage of some 2 million homes by 2020. The housing shortage is central to the cost of living crisis. Young people and families across England are struggling to get on the housing ladder and struggling with rents that are at a record high. The first thing that the Government did when they got into power was to cut the affordable homes budget by 60%-a huge cut. It is therefore no surprise that in the last year alone, there has been a 29% drop in the number of affordable homes that are being built. There are fewer home owners since the election, despite the previous Housing Minister, who is now Chairman of the Conservative party, claiming that the Government would increase home ownership. Tragically, homelessness and rough sleeping have risen in every year under this Government. Both are up by about a third since 2010. The number of families who are in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation is tragically at a 10-year high. What is the Government's approach to the biggest housing crisis in a generation? It seems to be a flurry of announcements. As my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State said in his opening speech, there have been no fewer than 400 announcements in the past three and a half years. However, their many warm words have not been matched by action. It seems that the Housing Minister recognises that that is a problem. He came to the House in November and told us thatâ€œthe new homes bonus is not about encouraging people to build homes.â€- Rather confusingly, he said later in a written parliamentary answer to me that it was an incentive to build homes. Perhaps today-third time lucky-he will clarify what the new homes bonus is for. The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee have both concluded that it has had little impact on housing supply. On the demand side, the Government have introduced Help to Buy. We strongly support help for first-time buyers but, crucially, Help to Buy must be matched by help to build. The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, who sits around the Cabinet table with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the cross-party Treasury Committee and the former Governor of the Bank of England have all said that the scheme carries risks for the economy. The Prime Minister's new housing adviser, Alex Morton, has gone even further by saying that it risks detonating a bomb under the British economy. However, the Government continue to do next to nothing to boost supply, which is pushing home ownership further out of reach for young people and families. While the Government are clearly complacent, the Labour party understands the scale of the challenge. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition announced in September that a Labour Government would build at least 200,000 homes a year by 2020. That is a realistic but ambitious agenda. We have asked Sir Michael Lyons to chair a commission that will draw up a detailed road map towards that aim, which is effectively to double the level of house building. There are specific areas that the commission will consider and specific problems that the Government are reluctant to recognise. I will refer to those briefly. The first concerns problems with the land market, the second is the restriction on communities' right to grow, and the third is the lack of any action by the Government on new garden cities and new towns. First, there are deep and structural problems with the land market. My hon. Friends the Members for Great Grimsby (Austin Mitchell) and for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts) have stressed that even in the good times the private sector did not deliver anywhere near the number of homes we need to keep up with demand. It is clear that developers are sitting on land and waiting for its value to increase. The Government seem to be in denial about land banking-although some of their Back Benchers seem to recognise it as a problem-but the International Monetary Fund and the Conservative Mayor of London clearly say it is a problem. We intend to give local authorities the power to escalate fees on developers who sit on land and, if that does not work, to use compulsory purchase orders if those developers still refuse to get on and build the houses that this country so desperately needs and for which communities are crying out. We also have a problem with the dominance of big house builders. Small house builders face major problems accessing land as well as finance, and the market is dominated by a few big house builders. That was not always the case; in the late 1980s, small and medium-sized house builders delivered two-thirds of new homes, but now SME builders build only around one third of new homes. We must find ways to make the market more diverse and competitive-I hope we can agree on that. Secondly, over the past three and a half years we have had warm words-in particular from the Deputy Prime Minister, but also earlier from the Prime Minister-about garden cities, yet not one measure has been taken to put in place conditions to deliver them. It was even reported last week at the start of the new year that the Prime Minister has forbidden Ministers from identifying any sites for potential new towns during this Parliament. Some would say that is pouring cold water on the proposal; others might say it is putting it into a deep freeze. Labour, on the other hand, is committed to new towns, which must form part of the solution to the housing crisis. The post-war Labour Government started 11 new towns because they had the determination and vision to act. That is exactly what we need now and what the Government are lacking. The Lyons commission is looking at ways to incentivise local authorities to come up with sites, and my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor recently committed a Labour Treasury to using guarantees-much like those provided for the Help to Buy scheme-to support the building of new towns.",65061,[],Housing,0,105,housing,1197

On this issue, as on many, Labour has a problem with credibility. It was the party that allowed access to mortgages six, seven, eight times individuals' salaries. It was a totally unsustainable path that contributed to the banking crisis that led to the deepest recession since the 1920s. Even in the boom years, it failed to deliver the required housing. The total build dropped to the lowest number in 100 years. It promoted eco-towns-10 in total-but not one appeared. New Labour at its finest: all spin and absolutely no delivery. Not only did Labour fail to deliver the houses promised, having nearly bankrupted the country, but it took the livelihoods of 250,000 construction workers and destroyed thousands of businesses by its actions. It talks about a cost-of-living crisis, but how many families did it break by its actions? How many meals did it take off the table by its actions? How many summer holidays were lost?

Our motion calls on the Government to bring forward a comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis, which should focus on: building more homes, including badly needed affordable homes; boosting home ownership, allowing people to fulfil their aspirations to buy their own home; improving private renting for the 11 million people now renting from a private landlord; and reducing homelessness and rough sleeping. Let us be clear that the big overarching problem is one of massive under-supply of new homes. In England, we are building only half the number of homes we need to keep up with demand. It is true that under successive Governments of different political colours there simply have not been enough homes built for decades. It is also the case, however, that in the past five years house building has fallen to its lowest level in peacetime since the 1920s. The Prime Minister likes to maintain that the Conservative party is the party of homeownership, but the truth and the facts fly in the face of his rhetoric. Homeownership has fallen to a 30-year low. It is, as it happens, at its lowest since the last time there was a majority Tory Government.",69100,[],Housing,0,4,housing,267

2015-06-10,Housing,275,Emma Reynolds,Lab,False,"I will take our record on building affordable homes over the Government's record at any time. We had the decent homes programme- Well, we built over half a million affordable homes in our term in office, and we have seen the number of homes built for social rent under this Government fall to a 20-year low. We have transformed the lives of all the people living in council houses when they were left to rack and ruin after 18 years of a Tory Government. The scale of the challenge ahead is therefore huge, but are the Government's policies up to the task? Let us consider them in turn. First, we have the Government's proposal to deliver 200,000 starter homes at a 20% discount. When questioned earlier this year on where the discount was coming from, the right hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) was completely unable to answer-and no wonder. The Government have said that the 20% discount will save the average first-time buyer Â£43,000. The likely overall cost would therefore be Â£8.6 billion. They claim that this will be paid for by removing levies for affordable housing and infrastructure, but their own figures suggest that the average cost of affordable housing contributions accounts for only a third of the proposed discounts. How would the rest of the discount be paid for? This also poses the question of who will pay for the vital infrastructure that we need in new housing development-a topic on which the Minister for Housing and Planning often speaks. After all, when it comes to new development-he and I know this very well-many people are concerned about the pressure on existing roads, schools and other services. When the Secretary of State responds, will he give us proper answers to these questions? Secondly, there is the proposal to extend the right to buy to housing association tenants. The Labour party is on the side of those who want to buy their own home. We want as many people as possible to fulfil that aspiration, but the Government's current proposals raise more questions than they answer. The hon. Members for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy), for South Dorset (Richard Drax), for Salisbury (John Glen), for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson) and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) have all raised concerns about the ramifications of the Government's proposals. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said that the Tory party had pulled a rabbit out of the hat in the final weeks of the election campaign, and needed timeâ€œto iron out its obvious iniquitiesâ€. The hon. Member for South Dorset said only last week:â€œThere is no doubt that the first generation would be extremely grateful, but what about those who follow?â€, and he expressed concerns about the proposals leading to a shortage of affordable homes. The hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said that these plans amount to â€œinsanityâ€-his characteristic turn of phrase-if more council houses are not built in the areas where they are sold. He also expressed concerns about this policy eroding the mixture of socio-economic groups in London. Conservative peers in the other place have also expressed concern. Baroness Byford described the proposals as anâ€œabsurd attack from a Conservative Government on the property rights of some of the most needed and respected charities in this countryâ€- The former head of the civil service and permanent secretary from the Secretary of State's own Department, Lord Kerslake, and Lord Turnbull, the former permanent secretary to the Treasury, have both said that the Government should think again. Beyond Parliament, other bodies have raised serious concerns. The CBI has said the proposal does nothing to â€œsolve the problemâ€ of the housing crisis, while the Chartered Institute of Housing said the figures â€œdid not stack upâ€. We have also seen those well-known socialist publications The Economist, The Spectator, The Daily Telegraph and the Evening Standard raising concerns. The Secretary of State thus needs to provide answers to the following questions. How much will this policy cost? The Conservatives refused to answer that question during the election campaign. The Department has also blocked, after an FOI request, the release of a secret document detailing the policy's costs and economic consequences. How will it be paid for? The Conservatives claimed during the election campaign that they would force councils to sell off their most expensive properties and use the proceeds to pay for the right-to-buy discount. However, the Government have no idea whether these 15,000 properties will become vacant every year, let alone whether Â£4.5 billion would be raised. In a response to a recent written parliamentary question, in which I asked the Secretary of State what estimates the Department had made about the value of these homes and the number that would become available each year, the Housing Minister admitted in his response that it simply did not know. Perhaps the Secretary of State will tell us how on earth the Government know how much money they will raise if they do not know how many of these properties there are, how many will become available and how much they are worth. Given that there will be a time lag between forcing councils to sell off expensive council properties and funding the discount, will the Treasury step in to fill the gap? What is the plan to replace the homes sold? The Government have yet again promised a one-for-one replacement on council homes sold-despite the Secretary of State claiming on the â€œTodayâ€ programme only a few weeks ago that no such promise was made in the last Parliament. I hope he has now had a chance to catch up on Tory party policy. It was their policy and it failed badly. For every 10 council homes sold through the right to buy in the last Parliament, only one council home started to be built. The question thus arises of why anyone should believe the Government's promises now. Serious questions have also been asked about the impact of the policy on the ability of housing associations to borrow money and build new homes. Moody's is now the third credit rating agency to warn about this policy's impact. It said that it could hit the financial viability of housing associations, risking their ability to raise private finance to pay for new house building. Here in our capital, the biggest group of housing associations has plans to build 93,000 new homes, with the vast majority of the funding coming from borrowing against future rental streams, but how many of those new homes will now be put at risk given that the rental streams and assets are so uncertain? Legal experts have expressed doubts about forcing independent charities to sell off their assets. Some have said these assets are not the state's to sell. Some will have been donated through their wills by individuals-some in their dying days-who wanted to provide homes for the most vulnerable people, such as those with disabilities, autism and indeed the aged or the homeless. Perhaps the Secretary of State could tell us whether these housing association properties will be included in the scope of the legislation. Other experts have suggested that this level of Government involvement with the assets of private independent charities will lead to the reclassification of the Â£70 billion-worth of housing association debt being reclassified as public sector debt. Have the Government assessed that risk? Ultimately, we will have to see what the Government bring forward, but the test for any housing policy of this Government must be whether it eases rather than deepens the housing crisis.",69100,[],Housing,0,26,housing,1272

Where are the measures that will provide a new generation of garden cities? Such measures would not only tackle the housing crisis, but help our economy to grow.

We must not forget the impact of the housing shortage on business. The CBI and many other business organisations have expressed concern about the lack of affordable homes for their employees.

However, I may give way towards the end of my speech if I am feeling generous. The number of affordable homes provided last year was the lowest for nine years, and the number of homes built for social rent hit a 20-year low. However, there seems, again, to be a complete absence of Government proposals for addressing the crisis in affordable housing. The Secretary of State's predecessor and the current Housing Minister reduced investment in affordable homes to a 14-year low, and watered down all manner of requirements for developers to build affordable homes in new developments. It is incumbent on the Secretary of State to adopt a fresh approach, and we hope that he will do so. He should also look at the definition of affordable homes, which has been totally skewed. Homes are simply unaffordable for many people on low incomes, and the impact on the housing benefit bill has been disastrous, which is also bad news for the taxpayer. Let me now say a little about the 11 million people who rent from private landlords. There are some excellent private landlords out there, who provide decent homes for their tenants, but too many tenants have to deal with poor standards and great insecurity. Many people-individuals, couples, and families with children-are now settling in the private rented sector, either because they cannot obtain a council or housing association home, or because they cannot get on to the housing ladder. However, there was no mention of private renters in either the Conservative manifesto or the Queen's Speech. Will the Secretary of State tell us what the Government will do to give that growing group of people the security and stability that they want? Will he also tell us how he will tackle the growing problem of homelessness and rough sleeping? In the years before he became Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition appeared to take a great interest in homelessness. Along with the former Housing Minister, the right hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), he set up the Conservative Homelessness Foundation. However, we hear little about that foundation now, and, indeed, we hear little about these issues. Might that be because homelessness has risen by 31% since 2010, and rough sleeping has risen by 55%?

2015-06-10,Housing,295,Emma Reynolds,Lab,False,"This is a serious issue and the Government need to do something about increasing the number of affordable homes.

It is not rocket science: in our country and some other countries where there is a lack of affordable housing, we see an increase in the number of people having to sleep rough on the streets or being referred by their local authorities to what is often called bed-and-breakfast accommodation but which looks nothing like bed-and-breakfast accommodation.

We are talking about some of the most vulnerable people in our country who are being made to live in temporary accommodation week after week, month after month, and individuals who are not considered to be a priority in law or statute by local authorities and who are simply left sleeping on the streets with all the dangers that entails. They are more vulnerable to being attacked, to violent crime and to dying at a very early age.",69100,[],Housing,0,46,housing,198

They have made it worse and they have particularly made it worse for people on low incomes and, in some parts of the country, for people on middle incomes. I am proud of the record we had in Government, but it is the case that there have not been enough homes built for quite some time-for decades-and I will not take lessons from the Conservative party. The case for a comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis is overwhelming. Indeed, at the homes for Britain rally in March the then Conservative party chairman-who is keen on making commitments-committed his party to publishing such a plan within a year of taking office. I am afraid that we have seen nothing of that so far, however. We will need to judge the Government on the test of whether they tackle the housing crisis in a serious way. That is why we have called for a comprehensive plan today. If the Government want to increase home ownership, not manage its decline, if they want to help private renters, not just ignore them, if they want to build more affordable homes and reduce homelessness and not just talk about it while affordable housing supply plummets and homelessness soars, and if they want to drive the wider economic benefits of building more homes too, they must set out a comprehensive, long-term plan to tackle the housing crisis, as we have put forward in our motion today.

The plans coming forward under the national planning policy framework are providing for 23% more homes than those they replaced. Neighbourhood planning is making a big contribution, right across the country. This Government are on the side of the working people of this country. We are for the ladder, not the queue. We are for the housing association tenant who aspires to buy their home, for the young family who want to sign up for a starter home, and for the couple who have always dreamed of owning their own home-with Help to Buy, we are helping them with their aspirations. We will support their aspirations. We will build more homes in every part of the country, so that Britain is a country of opportunity, where everyone who works hard can realise their dream of home ownership. That is the proud Conservative legacy, stretching back generations, from Disraeli to Macmillan, from Thatcher to Cameron.

2015-06-10,Housing,348,Eilidh Whiteford,SNP,False,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. May I say how refreshing it is to be called so early in the debate? I can assure you that that novelty will not wear off quickly. I begin by welcoming both the Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds) to their new roles. I also commend the official Opposition for dedicating their first Opposition day to housing, where the crisis is â€œurgent and growingâ€, as they so aptly put it. I trust they will not think I am making too barbed a comment when I say that I hope that reflects a change and a new prioritisation of housing on their part. As others have said, it is hard to avoid the inconvenient truth that this crisis goes back decades and reflects chronic underinvestment in social housing by successive UK Governments, Labour as well as Tory. That is one key issue that needs to be clearly stated today. The other is the deceptively simple point about supply and demand: there is a critical shortage of affordable housing in almost every part of the UK. In some ways, that is so obvious as to be self-evident. If it is not evident to Members of this House yet, it will be after the first round of constituency surgeries. I repeat that simple point because that shortage-that lack of supply of affordable homes-is the problem from which almost all the other issues stem. Unless we bite the bullet and start building affordable homes at scale, we will make limited headway and we just will not address the housing crisis. I can assure the House that housing is a priority for the SNP, and I hope I can look forward to hearing contributions from one or two of my new colleagues who will be seeking to catch your eye to make their maiden speeches in this debate, Mr Deputy Speaker. Although much of housing policy in Scotland is devolved to the Scottish Parliament, we cannot forget that the financial framework in which it operates is determined here at Westminster. When we consider the need for investment in affordable housing, particularly housing for social rent, we need to take account of the ongoing impact that austerity is having on the ability of social landlords to invest in new housing stock, and of the impact of cuts in capital expenditure on the ability of devolved and local governments to meet housing need. Scotland has had a 25% real-terms cut to its capital budget since 2010, and ongoing austerity will restrict the ability of future Governments to respond adequately to a growing shortage of affordable housing. The priority the SNP attaches to housing is underlined by the fact that despite the austerity cuts, the Scottish Government are on track to invest more than Â£1.7 billion in housing and deliver 30,000 new affordable homes by the end of their Parliament next year. They are already more than 90% of the way there. That track record compares very favourably with every other part of the UK and, indeed, with previous Administrations in Scotland. Perhaps the most illuminating measure to illustrate the relative performance of the Government's delivery of social housing across Great Britain is the ratio of completions per 100,000 of population. Last year the figure in Scotland was 65.3, which compares with only 44.7 in England and 24.6 in Wales. It is worth noting that since 2007 Scotland's ratio of completions has outperformed the rest of the UK for all types of housing, not just social housing, although those rates are still below pre-recession levels and the construction sector is still facing very challenging times. Although the Government have made much of their plans to extend right to buy to housing associations-a move that will compound rather than address the under-supply of affordable housing-we have gone down a different route in Scotland and ended the right to buy. That will enable us to keep up to 15,000 precious homes in the social sector over the next decade, and will protect the public investment that has been made in affordable housing. With nearly 200,000 people on the list for a council house in Scotland, we simply cannot afford to be depleting the stock further, and ending the right to buy is giving social landlords greater confidence to invest in new builds. Although I am making a case for investment in social housing, I want also to make clear the essential and valuable role that the private rented sector plays in our housing market. I want a thriving private rented sector that is an attractive and affordable option for tenants, and I am pleased that the Scottish Government established a strategy back in 2013 to enable growth and investment in the sector, to help improve the overall housing supply, and to improve consistency in the quality of management and the condition of property for rent. Measures such as the tenancy deposit scheme, the introduction of first-tier tribunals for disputes and the plans for further legislation to introduce a statutory code of conduct for letting agents are beneficial to landlords and tenants alike. But social housing remains a foundational piece of the housing jigsaw, possibly more so now than ever, as the spiralling property prices of recent decades have made home ownership increasingly unattainable for people on ordinary incomes. As the hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East said, the average house price in some parts of the country is 10 times the average salary. In Scotland, it is seven times the average salary, and that is simply not sustainable. The days when people could borrow only three times their salary are long gone, but I remember that when I got my first mortgage I was advised not to borrow that much because I would have to live, sustaining myself on what was left. Many people on good wages now cannot even think about buying a house. We have had exceptionally low interest rates in recent years, but I have real concerns about the level of debt many people are taking on just to house themselves and their families. I worry very much about how many of those people, who are mortgaged up to the hilt, will manage to service their debts when interest rates start to rise, as they inevitably must, given the floor they are on at the moment. That is the context in which home ownership has hit its 30-year low. Demand for rented accommodation in both the private and social sectors has soared, driving up rents to eye-watering levels in some places, not least here. For those on lower incomes, market rents in the current environment are just not realistic, and so demand for social housing is at unprecedented levels, too. Selling off housing association homes is not going to address that underlying problem; it just makes the problem worse because it fails to create any new supply to meet the demand that is growing in the market. It is worth making explicit the negative impact that this housing market failure is having on our social security system and our public spending. Housing benefit is one of the biggest-ticket items in the Department for Work and Pensions budget. As Ministers never tire of pointing out, the housing benefit bill has escalated substantially, and quite disproportionately, in recent years: there has been a 54% real-terms increase across Great Britain over the past decade. It is important that the House understands why that is happening, because to a very large extent those increases in the housing benefits bill are being driven by increases in private sector rents in areas of high demand and low supply of affordable housing. Almost a third of the increase is attributable to London alone-although there are other hotspots-but the Government do not want to accept that rents in this city are out of control and increasingly outwith the means of people earning normal wages. We are not even talking about low-paid people; we are talking about people with well-paid jobs who simply cannot afford a market rent. I hope the Government will take their head out of the sand and confront that issue. By contrast, in those parts of the UK where the housing pressures are not quite so acute, increases in housing benefit have been much more manageable and sustainable. In Scotland, for example, the inflation-adjusted increase in housing benefits for those in the social housing sector was only 6% over the same decade, which does not sound unmanageable. In Scotland-this is a key point-the ratio of housing benefit expenditure to GDP in the social rented sector was lower in 2012 than it was in 1997. That should give the Government and the Opposition Front Bench real food for thought. It would be very wrong to debate the housing crisis without mentioning the bedroom tax. In Scotland, around 70,000 households are liable for the bedroom tax, and 80% of them-much higher than in the rest of the UK-are the home of a disabled adult. Those are the people who already have the least choice in where they live. They are staying in the cheapest homes, and those homes have been allocated to them on the basis of their social need, not their household size. Given the depletion of the most modern social housing stock, thanks to the right-to-buy scheme, most of our extant council houses were built in an age when people had much bigger families, so we have a serious mismatch between the size of the available houses and the needs of today's tenants. If 60% of tenants need a one-bedroom property, but only 30% of the housing stock is that size, it does not take a maths genius to identify the underlying structural problem. Although the Scottish Government have provided money to ensure that everyone affected by the bedroom tax in Scotland can get a discretionary housing payment, that legislation remains on the statute book and tenants remain legally liable. I hope that the Scotland Bill currently going through the House will devolve the power to repeal that legislation in Scotland. I appeal to Ministers to look again at the punitive impact that the bedroom tax is having on some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people in our communities right across the UK, and recognise that it is simply not addressing the systemic issues underlying the housing crisis, namely chronic under-supply, under-investment and rents that have spiralled out of control. Before I conclude, I wish to say a few words about homelessness, because the motion specifically alludes to a rise in homelessness and rough sleeping. I have no doubt that recent changes to social security, delays and mistakes in the benefit system and the new sanctions regime are major contributory factors in those sharp increases, but on tackling homeless, it is important to put it on the record that in the past five years, the number of homeless applications in Scotland has fallen by 36%, and last year applications were down 8% on the previous year. That is not accidental. It is a consequence of progressive legislation that ensures that anyone who is assessed by the local authority as unintentionally homeless has a legal right to settled accommodation. That legislation has been recognised internationally as world leading and has been commended by the UN. It has not been easy to deliver those achievements. I pay tribute to the local authorities that have been working closely with the Scottish Government to reduce those figures. They have done that mostly by focusing efforts on prevention-preventing the most vulnerable from becoming homeless in the first place-and, crucially, by building many more houses in the affordable sector. We have made progress, but more needs to be done. I hope the Secretary of State will look seriously at how Scotland has reduced the rate of homelessness, and consider what might be emulated in a different context. The housing crisis cannot be fixed overnight, but the first step is to acknowledge the roots of the problem. It is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that under-investment in social housing by successive UK Governments has been a costly oversight and a big mistake. It is important that this Government acknowledge that their approach has been short-sighted and short term and that it has short-changed us all. Selling off the housing stock will not solve the problem, nor will pushing disabled tenants into the private sector.",69100,[],Housing,0,99,housing,2069

If the Government really want to house people and give them a decent place in which to live, they should understand that it is about security of tenure and having a place that people can call their home. I fear that until we are prepared to put money into building social housing, which incidentally would boost our economy and help our struggling construction industry, we will be back here repeatedly debating these issues over the next five years.",69100,[],Housing,0,100,housing,108
2015-06-10,Housing,350,Jake Berry,Con,False,"As this is the first housing debate in which I have spoken in this Parliament, I will take the opportunity to draw Members' attention to my declaration of interests as a landlord and a solicitor in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. I also take the opportunity to welcome the shadow Secretary of State and our new Secretary of State to their places. I look forward over the coming months to debating many issues around housing here in this Chamber. I support the Government's new right-to-buy policy of extending home ownership to 1.3 million housing association tenants. As a flagship policy of the last general election, the policy demonstrates the Conservative party's commitment to home ownership and helping people achieve their aspiration of owning their own home. I hope that, through debate in this Chamber, this excellent policy will be improved. There are two areas on which I wish to focus today, although I do understand that the policy is still being developed. Rural exception sites, as set out by the National Planning Policy Framework, are often owned and managed by housing associations. Members will probably be aware of such sites in their own constituencies. They are often outside a village boundary, and always outside existing planning policy. They are built in locations where market housing would not be acceptable because of local planning constraints. The local community may come forward with a site, but those sites can be brought forward only where there is proven and demonstrable need for affordable housing. I am talking here about areas such as the Lake district, Dingle's Way in Cornwall, which I have visited, and local areas in my constituency. If such rural exception sites were to become subject to the right to buy, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to see how they could be replaced. The Government have made a commitment for a one-for-one replacement following exercise of the right to buy policy in the local area-that was in the Department for Communities and Local Government's own guidance. That is not possible with rural exception sites. They are by their very nature exceptional and there is not the land available to replace that needed affordable housing. Will the Minister confirm that, as he develops the new extension to the right-to-buy policy as it affects housing associations, he will consider exempting rural exception sites from the policy, and inform the House what assessment he has made of the impact of this policy on social housing, particularly in national parks? The second point on which I wish to focus is the discount available to housing association tenants. The discount is significant and will, I think, attract housing association tenants who want to own their own home. But will the Government consider doing that by way of equity loan rather than a straight discount? We have seen the equity loan scheme used with great success as part of the hugely popular Help to Buy scheme. The reason why I propose an equity loan rather than a straight discount is that the interest rate will be payable after five years and, crucially, the Government will keep an equity stake in those houses as property prices increase. That will ensure a better return for the taxpayer and will enable the Government to benefit on a long-term bat on the property market, especially in areas of high demand, such as central London. This policy has, as its aspiration, a one-for-one replacement. It may be that an equity loan scheme, which will see more money coming back to the Government when the property is subsequently disposed of, will enable us to aim for a one-to-one-and-a-quarter replacement, or a one-to-one-and-a-half replacement as the policy matures over the years. It is clear to me that an equity loan, as opposed to a straight discount, would not be a clog on the sales of right-to-buy properties. As I have said, the scheme has been used very successfully in Help to Buy. Crucially, it creates a level playing field between those in the social sector who are looking to exercise their right to buy with the help of the Government and those in the private sector looking to exercise Help to Buy with the help of the Government. I hope that, as the Government develop this policy, they will consider those two points. I look forward to working with Ministers over the course of the legislation to see whether those ideas can be incorporated. Finally, let me touch briefly on the private rented sector. All of us who hold constituency surgeries will know that the British housing journey has changed. Traditionally, people would expect to be in private rented accommodation for a couple of years and then move into a house that they own. Now, people live in the private rented sector for up to 10 years or more. The assured shorthold tenancy has failed to change as the British housing journey has changed and is often not fit for purpose for people who are going to be in the private rented sector for a long period. That is why I support the work the Government have done on promoting family-friendly tenancy. I hope the Minister will be able to give us details of the uptake of such tenancies and, crucially, what stage he has reached in negotiations with lenders to ensure that, when lending to buy-to-let landlords, they have removed from their facility agreements some of the preclusions on granting tenancies in excess of one year. I will not be supporting the Opposition's motion, but I look forward to taking part in more debates in this Parliament.",69100,[],Housing,0,101,housing,938
2015-06-10,Housing,351,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"I am absolutely delighted that our first Opposition day debate of this Parliament is about housing, because very few issues are more important to the economic and social life of the country. As is often the case, it is important to look at the particular, rather than the general, in order to get a proper understanding both of the Government's proposals and of the nature of the problems we face, and I want to talk about London in that context. London faces unique challenges and has done for many years, but that is even more the case at present. We are now the second most expensive city in the world in terms of house prices. To buy a home in London, one needs nine times the average salary, which is a record figure. It is no coincidence that home ownership has become less feasible for Londoners. The number of homeowners has shrunk: fewer than half of all London households are now in home ownership, and in my constituency just three out of 10 households own their own homes. Social housing supply is also shrinking-we have already heard about some of the consequences of that-so demand inexorably turns to the private rented sector, pushing up rents, but also pushing up state subsidy in the form of housing benefit. It now costs the taxpayer Â£9 billion a year to subsidise private housing alone. Between 2010 and 2014, the Government spent Â£115 billion subsidising housing demand through home ownership support and housing benefit. I believe very strongly that there are better ways than that and the Government's latest proposals to spend that money. I do not think it is feasible for everyone to own their own home, but I very much support methods of encouraging home ownership for those for whom it is feasible. I regret-this is a particular problem in London-that the shared-ownership model of supporting home ownership for people on low incomes is broken. We need to put fresh life into it and I believe that that is probably a better way of supporting an increase in home ownership in higher-cost areas. The simple fact is that the Government's proposal for the right to buy housing association properties is massively expensive and we do not have answers from them as to how it will be properly funded. The National Housing Federation estimates that it will cost Â£11.6 billion, and the hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson), in his capacity as the Mayor of London, described it before the election as a crazy measure that would require â€œmassive subsidies.â€",69100,[],Housing,0,102,housing,430

2015-06-10,Housing,353,Karen Buck,Lab,False,"I absolutely agree with my right hon. Friend that the issue with right to buy is replacement, as has been the case for some years. I will come to that in a moment. The Government tell us that, in order to fund the cost of the discount for housing association sales, the replacement of properties and the investment in brownfield regeneration, they intend to force local authorities to sell high-value stock. We are not yet clear about whether they propose a regional solution whereby a third of properties would be sold by region, or whether they will require each individual local authority to sell those properties. As my right hon. Friend has said, it will be extremely difficult to replace properties. What will be the consequences of forcing local authorities to sell off their stock? Put simply, they will not be able to meet their housing obligations, carry out tenant transfers, relieve overcrowding, assist people with high medical priorities or assist homeless households. In London, it is estimated that, in my local authority, which is one of the high-value areas that will be most affected, the proposal will end lettings.

People who would have been housed in relatively row rent local authority stock will now have to be placed in the private rented sector, where the properties are much more expensive. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds) has said, Lord Kerslake from the other place has estimated that the proposal will also result in the loss of Â£5 billion-worth of housing investment in London. I do not know how Londoners approaching an election next year are going to feel about the fact that, despite the incredibly high pressure on housing in the capital, they are going to lose Â£5 billion-worth of housing stock. There are a number of unanswered questions about how this is all going to work, some of which have been asked by my hon. Friend. I would have loved to go through them, but, because time is pressing, I will not do so. We will return to them in the Bill. The Government have, however, failed to answer one critical point, and I think that is deliberate. They are talking about a one-for-one replacement. There have been no guarantees, but they are not talking about a like-for-like replacement. We know perfectly well that properties sold from the local authority stock tended to be of better quality and provided family-sized accommodation, but there is no guarantee that replacement properties under this proposal will provide such accommodation. This is a fundamentally flawed scheme in many important respects.

Let me also take the opportunity to wish you a very happy birthday today, although I do not wish to blot my copybook by mentioning which birthday it is. It is a particular pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck), who has, I know, taken a long-standing interest in housing issues. I pay tribute to my predecessor, the right hon. Sir Richard Ottaway. He was an officer in the Royal Navy before he came to this place, he served as Michael Heseltine's Parliamentary Private Secretary, he served on the Front Bench in opposition and he served in the Whips Office in John Major's Government-a fairly challenging task, but one that we hope will not need to be repeated during the course of this Parliament, judging by the size of last night's majority. Sir Richard served with great distinction as Chairman of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and in that capacity was banned by the Chinese from entering Hong Kong-a sure sign that he must be doing something right. There was, however, one biting disappointment late in Sir Richard's career. I refer, of course, to the Westminster dog of the year event, in which his beloved spaniel Roxy was beaten by an Alsatian from Stoke-on-Trent South and a poodle from Surrey Heath. Fortunately, I can report that Sir Richard has now recovered from the abject humiliation of being beaten by the Justice Secretary's poodle and I know that hon. Members will want to join me in wishing Sir Richard, Lady Ottaway and their spaniel Roxy well in their life after Parliament. Croydon South is a fantastic constituency with diverse communities ranging from Coulsdon through Purley, Kenley, Selsdon, Sanderstead and Waddon to Croham. I shall try to be of service to everybody in the constituency, regardless of their background. Some people think of Croydon South as having sprung up in the 1920s and 1930s, but let me correct them. The earliest constituents in Croydon South turned up in Neolithic times, on my doorstep at a beautiful place called Farthing Downs in Coulsdon, in the year 10,000 BC. I lay claim to Croydon South being the longest continuously inhabited constituency in the country. Urbanisation came with the arrival of the railway in 1841, if Members will forgive me for skipping over the intervening 12,000 years in the interests of the time limit. I can see that you approve of that, Mr Deputy Speaker. Many of us today rely on the railway to get into London, but I am sorry to say that Southern has not been performing well recently. It has been terrible. But I am pleased to report that the Rail Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Claire Perry), whom we met the week before last, has promised personally to get to grips with this serious problem. Kenley airfield in the constituency was in the front line of this country's defence during the battle of Britain. The extraordinary feats accomplished in that summer, 75 years ago, serve to remind us of what this nation can achieve when we pull together as one United Kingdom. My father's family has lived in south London for generations. I well remember my first Crystal Palace game at Selhurst Park 24 years ago on Boxing Day 1991, against Wimbledon. The score was one all, if anyone was wondering. I was brought up in the area and went to a local grammar school and I firmly believe that grammar schools give children from ordinary backgrounds like mine the opportunity to achieve their full potential. People in Croydon South believe that hard work and enterprise are the best ways of combating poverty and promoting prosperity. Businesses such as the Wing Yip Chinese supermarket on Purley Way and BSW Heating in Kenley are the lifeblood not just of our economy but of our society. I share those values. Over the past 15 years, I have set up and run my own businesses in this country and overseas. I set up my first business when I was 24. I started by driving the delivery van myself, and eventually floated that company on the stock market. My grandfather also drove a delivery van and he grew up in Peckham. I think he would be very proud, if he were still with us, to see his grandson speaking on the Floor of the House today. I am pleased to be speaking in a debate on housing, in which I should quickly declare an interest as a business I set up is involved in this area. It is vital that we secure more housing for young people. Home ownership is a fundamentally good thing, which is why I fully support the extension of the right to buy. I am pleased to report that in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell), housing starts increased by 251% from 593 in 2013 to 2,084 in 2014. That has been made possible by developing suitable brownfield sites and I fully support the Government's plans to use surplus public sector land to develop more housing as well as getting local development orders in place on 90% of brownfield sites by 2020 to ensure that the increase in housing supply that is so essential continues.

Members of this House in such an important debate. All this week, I have listened to a variety of maiden speeches, which have come in as many shapes, sizes and colours as the Members who sit in this House. Such diversity of speeches and Members is to be warmly welcomed. Outside this Chamber, our country is equally if not more diverse and it is right and proper that this place should reflect that reality. As Norwich's-and indeed Norfolk's-first-ever black MP, I like to think that I am making my own small personal contribution to that challenge. Half Grenadian, half English, I am proud of the rich heritage I have inherited from both sides of my working-class family. On my Grenadian side it was my father's passion for trade unions and socialism that, it could be argued, ultimately led me to this place. On my mother's English side, listening to the tales of my grandfather, a paratrooper who fought fascism in Normandy in the second world war, I developed an interest in the military-an interest that would ultimately lead me to become a reservist infantry officer, culminating in a tour of Afghanistan in 2009. But let me advise the House and any would-be armchair generals listening that it would be a grave error to mistake my service for a guarantee of support for future military adventurism. It is not. Better the House should see me as a pragmatic dove, sadder and wiser for my experience with the limitations of firepower when it comes to achieving our long-term security. Let me tell the House a little more about my constituency, Norwich South, and the city that sent me here to be its voice unto power. The previous MP to be sent here was my predecessor Simon Wright. As both a teacher and an MP, he has given many years of his life to public service-service given dutifully and to the best of his ability. For that I thank him on behalf of our city. For those who have not had the pleasure of visiting the fine city of Norwich, let me assure them that it is far more than the home of Alan Partridge and Radio Norwich. It is one of only a few cities with two cathedrals, it has an historically iconic marketplace and it has at its centre what is considered one of the finest examples of an 11th-century Norman castle in western Europe. Looking out from the top of Norwich castle, one sees our city spread out in uneven but concentric circles-the closer to the castle, the older the buildings. Moving out from the sites of historical slums, one begins to see the advent of 19th and 20th-century affordable social housing. My fear is that future generations of my city will look out from that castle and ask themselves, â€œWhat happened to the social housing of the 21st century?â€ Having listened to the Queen's Speech, my fear is that the answer will be, â€œThe foresight and wisdom of past generations spanning more than a century was squandered for the short-term gain of a few.â€ Today, as we debate the crucial issue of housing, we have a Government who are, in effect, seeking to forcibly asset-strip housing associations. Not content with that, they would also force local authorities to sell off their already scarce housing stock to fund this supreme tragic folly. In my humble opinion, this is a policy as economically incompetent as it is ideologically obnoxious. In one fell stroke it will increase the division between those who own properties and those who do not. It will raise rents, increase the housing benefit bill, fuel house price inflation, further segregate my city and increase the number of homes that are owned as mere units of speculation. For many of my constituents it is not an asset they desire, but a roof over their head and a place they can call home. As their MP, this is what I will fight for. Some may call that radical, but if striving for decent affordable homes for my constituents garners me that label, I will wear it with pride, for both Norwich and Norfolk have a long history of bearing radical sons and daughters. Take Robert Kett and his rebellion against the injustice of land enclosure in the 16th century. Kett led the poor and disfranchised of my city and beyond as they defied the wealthy who wished to take their land from them. Fast forward to today, and the robber barons are back. Take some of the academy chains operating in Norwich, such as the Inspiration Trust. Not content with taking over our schools and giving parents no say in their children's education, it craves ever more power and wealth. Now it wants to take from the people of Norwich the Hewett local authority school and the Â£60 million of land it sits on-land that belongs to the people of my city. Then there is the Earlham early years Sure Start centre in one of the most deprived parts of my city, now told by its new landlords-again, the Inspiration Trust-that it is to be evicted and must find new premises. Indeed, the robber barons are back. But now, as then, the people of Norwich are defiant. They will not go silently into the night. They will not be asset-stripped and thrown out on to the streets without a fight-a fight I am proud to be part of. At the end of it all, I only hope I fare slightly better than Robert Kett. Captured by the nobles, he was eventually executed and his body left hanging in chains from Norwich castle. The Inspiration Trust is ruthless, but I hope not quite that ruthless. I hope, then, that the spirit of Norwich-its defiance in the face of injustice; its desire, as the saying goes, to â€œdo differentâ€-will move and guide me in the years ahead, because now, more than ever, my constituents need hope: hope that we in this House can articulate an alternative to the politics of despair that austerity represents. My constituents deserve nothing less, and nothing less will they get from me.",69100,[],Housing,0,110,housing,1044
2015-06-10,Housing,360,James Cartlidge,Con,False,"I congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich South (Clive Lewis) on his maiden speech. As a Suffolk MP, it is good to see that there are some good things coming out of Norfolk. I want to draw the House's attention to my interests. I am a controlling shareholder in a mortgage broker and property portal that is focused on the shared ownership sector. It includes First Steps, which will be of interest to London MPs. According to the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association, if current trends in tenure continue, two decades from now, for the first time since the early 1970s, the majority of Britons will rent their home. I have spent my commercial life focused on first-time buyers, and I do not want to live in a country where home ownership is restricted to the few. That is why I strongly support the measures proposed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to support home ownership, particularly the extension of the right to buy. It is important to remember that this is not just about getting on the property ladder; it is about people keeping a roof over their head. Housing repossessions are at the lowest level for nine years; indeed, repossessions and arrears are falling. I welcome that. We must never forget that a key element of any housing policy is a strong economy in which people can afford to pay their mortgages, gain employment to obtain mortgages, keep paying their rent, and so on. I am proud to be a Conservative in a Government who are delivering a strong economy where people can get on the ladder and get on in life. I set up my company in 2004. I was originally a mortgage broker, although we have since diversified, and I want particularly to focus on mortgages. I have to say to the shadow housing spokesman, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds), that when we started in 2004 I was absolutely shocked and appalled by some of the practices in the mortgage lending industry. I was stunned that people who already had an adverse credit history and huge unsecured debts would call us up seeking a mortgage. Indeed, they were often able to obtain one, on a self-certified basis, through so-called adverse, heavy-adverse and super-adverse products. One very famous American bank even had a â€œcredit builderâ€ product, which basically meant â€œunlimited-adverseâ€. People could have missed as many payments as they wanted and still obtain a mortgage. Those were bad days for the mortgage industry. They were overseen by the Financial Services Authority, which was set up by Gordon Brown in 1997. When he did so, he said that it would give stability to the financial sector. For me, the biggest failure of the Labour Government was their failure to regulate the mortgage sector. I was a business owner in the mortgage sector, and we constantly received correspondence from the Financial Services Authority-huge reams of regulation and gobbledegook. Every six months we had to submit a capital adequacy return. Northern Rock would have been doing the same thing, so why could not the FSA have spotted what was happening? It was an incredible failure to regulate banking. Let us not forget that 1998 to 2007 was the most unprecedented period of growth in house prices in this country, so when Labour Members table a motion about first-time buyers and affordability, they must recognise their own culpability in this matter. One specific issue that I feel very strongly about is the growth of buy-to-let. I would never criticise anybody who has invested in property, especially given that we have had such problems in our pensions sector, not least because of the tax brought in-again-by Gordon Brown. I do not blame anyone for doing that, and I do not think we should do anything to clamp down on existing buy-to-let, because that would force rents up. However, when we look at new entrants to the market in the years ahead, we have to start to take account of the fact that the assets in buy-to-let will shortly hit Â£1 trillion. The key point about buy-to-let is that it is not a level playing field. Those properties are properties that first-time buyers wish to buy as well. Three key aspects illustrate why buy-to-let is not a level playing field. The first is stamp duty. If I buy my first property, I pay the same rate of stamp duty as someone buying their 15th buy-to-let portfolio property. I do not think that is acceptable. Then there is tax relief, which has been raised by hon. Members in all parts of the House. If we were to give first-time buyers the ability to offset their mortgage repayments against tax, we would be told that that was stimulating house prices, yet we feel quite happy that a buy-to-let landlord should be able to do the same. Again, I have a real problem with that. The most important point is about mortgages. If someone telephones our biggest mortgage bank, which was bailed out at great cost by the public, they will find that a residential customer-a first-time buyer or home mover-has to have a capital repayment mortgage, which is absolutely right, but that a buy-to-let landlord can get a mortgage for the same property from the same bank on an interest-only basis. The Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association has stated:â€œThe â€˜triple lock' of the new regulatory landscape-the mortgage market review (MMR), Basel 3 capital adequacy rules and macro-prudential regime, disadvantages first-time buyers relative to buy-to-let borrowers and may help to entrench the decline of owner-occupation going forward.â€That is what the mortgage lending industry says. It went on:â€œFor example under the MMR at an interest rate of 4%, first time buyers required to take out a capital repayment mortgage will face monthly mortgage payments 58% higher than a landlordâ€, who is probably borrowing to lend the property out to frustrated first-time buyers.",69100,[],Housing,0,111,housing,990

2015-06-10,Housing,362,James Cartlidge,Con,False,"It has to be said that the oversight of mortgages could not have been worse: it was a very grave failure under the FSA. The thing about the level playing field is that I want to see a country where first-time buyers on average earnings have a realistic prospect of buying a home, which is not that ambitious. I am a one nation Conservative, and I do not want to be in a two nation country with those who own property and those who have absolutely no chance of doing so. That is the key point. There are those who will feel that owning their own home is a long way away, but they want to feel that they have a chance. That is one reason why I support measures such as the extension of the right to buy and the Help to Buy individual savings account deposits. We want to give people opportunity. As we move forward, Mr Speaker- Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is the force of very short habit, as I have only just got into the House. I want us to consider such points, because we need a level playing field. House prices are affected not just by building and the supply of building; demand factors are critical as well. House prices collapsed in 2008 not because we suddenly built more homes, but because of the economy and what happened to mortgage finance. I hope that my right hon. and hon.

2015-06-10,Housing,363,Richard Burgon,Lab,False,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for calling me to make my maiden speech this afternoon. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich South (Clive Lewis) on his truly inspirational maiden speech. The constituency of Leeds East-or East Leeds as we locals call it, because it is not just a constituency; it is a distinct area as well-is a place I could not be prouder to represent. Leeds East is my home, and my family have lived and worked in Leeds East for over 100 years, ever since coming from Ireland to look for work. Before I talk about Leeds East, I want to talk about my predecessor, George Mudie. He served our community for nearly 40 years: first, as a local councillor in Seacroft in Leeds East; then as leader of Leeds City Council; and then as our MP. For me, he embodied the ethos of public service. In an age when so many are so cynical about elected representatives, he remains loved and respected across East Leeds and across Leeds. People know he was in politics for the right reasons-not to feather his nest or carve out a career come what may, but to make life better for ordinary people. To listen to him speaking up for his constituents, for our area and for accountable, well-funded public services in public hands was to witness someone speaking with a real moral force that no kind of synthetic media training could match. The memory of George Mudie's tireless work as our MP lives on in the minds and hearts of all those whose lives he improved. From Crossgates to Colton, from Halton Moor to Harehills, from Swarcliffe to Seacroft and Gipton, Leeds East is a fantastic place. People are friendly, people-including perhaps their MP-â€œtell it how it isâ€, and people by and large have always supported the correct team, whether that be in football or in politics. But all is not well in Leeds East, and housing is one of the major issues in my constituency. It is a constituency where the percentage of people owning their home has gone down, where the percentage of people renting a council house is markedly down and where the percentage of people renting from private landlords is markedly up. Wages are too low, rents are too high and Leeds City Council does not have enough council houses or enough money to build enough more of them. Too many people are priced out of buying a house. In the past four years, the number of people in Leeds East who are in work but who have to rely on housing benefit has increased by nearly 80%-not a surprise when one in five people in work in Leeds East do not get paid a living wage and more and more have been pushed on to zero-hours contracts. Last year, there were over 18,000 people in Leeds on the council house waiting list. So-called â€œaffordable homesâ€ are affordable in name only, at 80% of the market rent, and it must not be forgotten that 1,440 homes in Leeds East are hit by this Government's cruel bedroom tax. For the first time in not far off a century, mothers and fathers across Leeds East face the reality that their children have less chance of getting a council house and of being able to afford to buy a home than they did when they were their age. The people of Leeds East deserve better. They need a Government who will not just â€œleave it to the marketâ€ when it comes to housing and everything else; a Government who will control rent increases; a Government who will give local councils the money they need to build council houses; a Government who will not force councils and housing associations to deplete their housing stock at bargain-basement prices; a Government who will resist the big building companies' pursuit of quicker and easier profits and ensure that brownfield sites are built on first in an effort the better to protect our green belt; and a Government who will not choose to hit the most vulnerable with policies such as the bedroom tax. Fundamentally, people in Leeds East need a Government with an alternative economic strategy, and an economy that works in the interests of ordinary people, not just in the interest of big business and the super-rich. The economic divide we now have in the UK makes a mockery of the Conservative rhetoric of one nation. Our nation is in fact divided into those whom the current economic system serves and those whom the current economic system uses and, all too often, abuses. In politics, in life and in the economy, I believe that fulfilment of potential only comes when, in the words of the Leeds United song, we are â€œMarching On Togetherâ€. There is such a thing as society and there is such a thing as community. I am proud of the society and community I come from and I look forward to standing up for the people of East Leeds in this House in the years ahead.",69100,[],Housing,0,114,housing,848
2015-06-10,Housing,364,Mims Davies,Con,False,"East Leeds and Eastleigh-so close and yet so far. It is a pleasure to speak following some fine maiden speeches on both sides of the House. I welcome the housing Bill. It will give the right to buy to those people who made the effort to contact me during the election campaign to say that it would make a difference to their life, their planning, their schools and their children. My hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry) raised the issue of family-friendly policy. Those on the Conservative Benches should look at that, and I would be supportive of it. I thank the Housing Minister for meeting me soon after I walked into the House and for allowing me to make representations about concerns in my constituency. However, I want to highlight a different point. We have heard a lot about community and about challenges, but we have heard very little about people actively being involved in the choices for their community. There has been scaremongering, and I would find it worrying if I were trying to get involved in housing at a local level or in local community activism to secure, for example, a rural exception site. People want a home for their children and grandchildren, but there has been a lack of local planning in my patch. It concerns me that there is a lack of brownfield development in Eastleigh. There is no local plan and no five-year land supply, and there is not one neighbourhood plan. People are not involved, which is fundamentally wrong given that we have a localism agenda that people could get involved in. The lack of involvement of parish councils in my area concerns me. One plan introduced in 2011 would have helped to bring forward a much needed bypass, which would have been part of a way of ensuring controlled development. That has not happened in Botley, because it was discouraged by the local council, which, as a borough council, was keen to prevent local people from getting involved. One person's new carpet and shiny new kitchen is another person's concern about losing green space, so decisions will always be finely balanced. We need more parish councils and more local people to be involved in making their communities the place they want to live in. With the Localism Act 2011, we have the ability to look forward to the next 20 or so years. The lottery of the planning inspectors is the other reason why I am on my feet. We need fairer planning rules, so that we can find the right balance. I was concerned to find in my inbox today a letter from a developer telling me how one local bypass would be brought forward, because it had had the idea and was already working on it with the council. However, that was different from my information. The problem is that there is no plan, so there is nothing to work from. That is what I am seeking to highlight. Many of my constituents have taken the time to write to me about their concerns time after time, and it would be remiss of me not to bring their comments to the House. The lack of a local plan means that historic sites in my area, with listed buildings within their curtilage, are under threat, such as Stoneham Park and the Bursledon windmill. That is lamentable. We can do something about housing if we actively involve ourselves as communities. There are 9,000 parish councils across the UK, but six in 10 people do not have a parish council and do not get involved in neighbourhood planning. The Government have put localism on the statute book so that if people do not feel that they are adequately involved, they can get involved. I am delighted that the Government will continue to promote that, alongside the changes that will be made in the housing Bill.",69100,[],Housing,0,115,housing,656

I point out my entry in the Register of Members' Financial Interests-I am a landlord. I know that people have views on both sides of the argument, but the good news is that if we get these things right, our constituents will see the benefit. Perhaps they will be able to be part of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme, which has brought 127 people on to the housing ladder in Eastleigh, or the New Buy completion scheme, which has brought 15 people on to the ladder. I support the Department for Communities and Local Government in that, and I welcome the Secretary of State's comments today, but I would like more of a balance in how housing is brought forward.

2015-06-10,Housing,369,Steve Pound,Lab,False,"Sorry, it's Colin's brother. We are speaking today on an incredibly important subject. Last Friday morning, I went to the extreme east end of the District line, where a family from my constituency have been housed in temporary accommodation at the other end of London. The children have to get up at 7am to carry on attending their primary school in Northolt in my constituency. It takes an hour and a half to get there, before the day has even started. This is the reality of the housing crisis in the nation as a whole, but particularly in London. The housing that that family could once have aspired to has been sold. It is one of the cruellest ironies that some 42% of temporary accommodation that we provide under the private sector leasing scheme in Ealing is former council housing. What are the Government proposing? Are they talking about a sensible house building programme? Are they talking about fiscal incentives and mechanisms to assist people in buying properties? No. They are proposing one of the most cruel, stupid and brutal pieces of legislation I have heard of in my life. Harold Macmillan was mentioned earlier, a man who spoke for a time when we thought that housing was something that should be built, not sold off, and something that is not a bribe but an entitlement and a right. I have great respect for the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. He is a good man, but he has fallen among asset strippers here today. Harold Macmillan talked about selling off the family silver. Well, we are talking about selling off the family shelter. The idea is that the Government can go to a charitable housing association and say, â€œWe are going to nationalise you and then we're going to liquidate you and sequester your assets.â€ How on earth can anything think for a moment that that is a logical or sane way to go forward? I wish to do the Conservative party a favour. I wish to save them from themselves. I know there is no chance whatsoever of this proposed legislation actually seeing the light of day and becoming an Act. It simply cannot work. There will be legal challenges. As soon as we start to drill down into the minutiae, it will be realised that the Government simply cannot take a private asset and sell it off as a possible bribe to the future. If they want to take the logic of this forward, why not go to every single private landlord-including the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies), who confessed to being a landlord-and say to them in an attempt to expand the property-owning democracy that made this nation great, â€œWe're going to take your property.

2015-06-10,Housing,371,Steve Pound,Lab,False,"I wish I could, but I cannot. I believe in the fairly basic precept that no person should have a second home as long as there is one person who has no home. Will the proposed legislation-I address specifically the issue of extending the right to buy, the sequestration of housing associations-make any difference whatsoever? It will. It will make matters a great deal worse. Housing associations will lose their collateral base. They will lose their ability to borrow. There will not be some great freeing up of assets spreading across the nation. Rather, there will be the same slithering, slimy people scurrying around the remnants of our housing estates trying to persuade people to buy their property, to realise their assets and to free up the money in their property. These poodle-faking spivs have had the time of their lives under Conservative Governments. We do not want to see it reach an efflorescence again under this ludicrous Bill. In case after case in our surgeries, every one of us surely hears heartbreaking stories arising from the housing crisis. If someone is ill, they can go home until they feel better. If they lose their job, they can go home and apply for other jobs. If they lose their home, they are on a slippery slope to perdition. Homelessness means not just not having a home; it means being on the street and losing one's health and one's future. I spoke earlier about a primary school child making a one-and-a-half-hour journey in the morning and afternoon. What will be the corrosive effect of that on future generations? It will destroy their hopes, their dreams and their ability to learn and become good citizens. The Bill will not help. Let us save the Conservative party and say, â€œGet away from this nonsense of trying to bribe the future with their own propertyâ€, and let us look at building new housing.

2015-06-10,Housing,372,Kit Malthouse,Con,False,"I also congratulate you on your ascension, Madam Deputy Speaker. I join the Secretary of State in lamenting the lack of humility from Labour over their previous policy. It was my colleague on the London Assembly, the charming Tom Copley, who blew the lid off its record by revealing that more social housing was built in the final year of Margaret Thatcher's Administration than in the whole of the 13 years of Labour. The situation is even worse than that, however, because during those 13 years Labour created an unsustainable housing market, with rapidly rising prices, very thin mortgage equity requirements and a much looser credit situation than now. It then crashed the market and, once it had been revived, decided that the best thing to do was to propose a tax on it-the mansion tax. That is no solution to what is an extremely pressing problem. There is much to commend in the Government's plan presented in our manifesto and the proposed Bill, which addresses access to the market as well as supply. The brownfield register; the housing zone; the promotion of garden towns, the starter homes-all that is extremely welcome, but there are two areas I particularly want to address. One is the extension of right to buy, which I support. It has much potential to enable the same social change and progression that the right to buy council housing did during the 1980s and 1990s. I want, however, to bring two areas to my right hon. Friend's attention. One was eloquently highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry): exceptions for small rural communities, particularly in extremely delightful areas to live, such as large parts of my constituency, where there is pressure on housing already-I will not elaborate on that. Secondly, will the Secretary of State consider a transferable discount, so that housing association tenants can realise the value of their discount and transfer it into the private sector, with various conditions applied. That might solve the problem of disposing of the house, but also give them the freedom to move on. The second area I want to talk about, which sadly is not mentioned in the motion, is the role of the planning system, particularly the Planning Inspectorate. One of the revolutions that the previous Government introduced was the notion of local neighbourhood plans. I am pleased to say that large parts of my constituency have embraced the idea with extreme enthusiasm. From larger settlements, such as Whitchurch, Oakley, Kingsclere and Overton, to small villages, such as St Mary Bourne in the middle of my constituency, people have worked hard on their local neighbourhood plan. It has excited much interest in the community and quite a lot of debate, and for the first time in these areas, people feel as if planning is something being done with them, rather than to them. Still hovering above them, however, is the role of the Planning Inspectorate. I hope that over the next few months or weeks, as we debate the Bill, we can address the issue of the inspectorate and the game of poker that its existence creates in the planning system for local authorities. Far from smoothing the passage of planning applications, the planning inspectorate is more often used, I find, as an excuse to slow things down, as a complicated game of chicken is played between developer, local authority and local community about what each thinks the planning inspector will deal with. If localism is really to take hold, locally elected democratic representatives, including the Mayor of London-even with his vast majority and mandate, he has to bear in mind the chap in a suit from Bristol-will have to play a part in dealing with the possibly negative effect of the planning inspectorate. I think that any fear and loathing generated in communities by this problem needs to be addressed. Finally, let me say a few words about homelessness. The shadow Secretary of State tried to offer a simplistic solution to the rough-sleeping problem by saying that it is just about housing. That does a disservice to those many people who unfortunately find themselves on the street. There are complicated issues relating to mental health, alcohol, drug addition, previous life experience-particularly for the high proportion of rough sleepers who have been in the forces and might have post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health problems-that need to be addressed. Having worked as a councillor on this issue, I am aware that many people living on the street are very hard to help. Offering them just housing as a solution will often not get them very far. It was Ronald Reagan who said:â€œThere is no limit to the amount of good you can doâ€in politics,â€œif you don't care who gets the credit.â€I am extremely pleased to see my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in his place on the Front Bench. We were councillors together, and he has worked very hard on the localism agenda over the last five years. It is good to see him in a position where he is able both to achieve great things for housing in this country and to take much of the credit.",69100,[],Housing,0,123,housing,869
2015-06-10,Housing,373,Catherine West,Lab,False,"It is an honour to give my maiden speech today in the birthplace of Westminster democracy-a model that many other countries have used as a blueprint for their fledgling democracies. We must never forget that others look to us for leadership internationally not just on democracy, but on human rights, too. In the constituency of Hornsey and Wood Green, democracy features strongly. In the year I was born, 1966, the Conservative Hugh Rossi was elected and remained the MP until 1992, when he resigned. He was followed by the Labour Minister Barbara Roche who was the MP until 2005, when the Liberal Democrats' Lynne Featherstone won the seat. Tory, Labour and Liberal over a relatively short space of time-democracy is certainly alive and kicking in Hornsey and Wood Green. My predecessor, Lynne Featherstone, was well respected locally for her ministerial work on gay marriage and her campaigning for an end to the vile practice of female genital mutilation-causes that I am sure she will continue to pursue. I am very pleased to speak on housing and equally happy that my hon. Friends have brought this crucial matter forward as an Opposition debate so early in this Parliament. I am pleased, too, to see a fresh face in the Government. I am not sure what happened to his predecessor, but it is with a huge sigh of relief that those of us who come from local government see a slightly different face. I hope that this will presage some positive moves around the housing agenda. My constituency is one of great contrasts, with households on low incomes living in the graceful, but dilapidated, Victorian Noel Park estate. I was always amazed by our Victorian and even our post-war predecessors who saw the need to invest in housing for working communities and made it happen. In the coming months, so much energy will be spent on needlessly debating the merits of the â€˜right to buy' for housing stock where people are securely housed, when we could be getting stuck into building more for the many who lack housing security. There are so many excuses why we cannot do that, when we should be determined to build, build, build to address the critical imbalance between the supply and demand for housing. In the west of my constituency, leafy boulevards of Edwardian splendour nestle in the foothills of Alexandra Palace Park and run along the boundaries of the spooky Highgate and Queen's woods-28 hectares of ancient woodland known for its archaeological treasure trove of Roman pottery. The famous landmark of Alexandra Palace, originally known as â€œthe Palace of the Peopleâ€ was leased to the BBC in 1935 for its new television service, and its glass dome provides a magnificent backdrop, which today's shoppers can gaze at from the Wood Green shopping city. One hundred and eighty languages are spoken in our local schools. As an immigrant myself, I am proud of our rich diversity. Immigration is too commonly seen as a handicap when, in truth, it is our strength. Recent research has shown that households privately renting in Hornsey and Wood Green spend Â£250 of the average weekly wage of Â£500 on rent. Guidelines issued by Shelter, the national housing charity, state that a third of average weekly earnings should be spent on housing costs, not 50% as is the case in Hornsey and Wood Green. Costly housing is holding back the London economy, making London unaffordable for the workforce, and creating public health problems as a result of overcrowding. In short, â€œgeneration rentâ€ needs a break. It is good to see so many London Members here today. Not a day goes by without a London Member of Parliament or councillor hearing someone's heartbreaking story about overcrowded housing. The knock-on effect of high-cost rented housing is that fewer young people can purchase their own homes. The Government's much flaunted Help to Buy scheme has helped fewer than 20 households in my constituency. Meanwhile, the deregulation of pensions in recent times is fuelling the â€œbuy to letâ€ market and pushing up prices. There is nothing short of a housing crisis. People in housing need are being failed by this Government-and I am tired of hearing Members talk about what we did in the Labour Government. That is ancient history. I have been here for one month, and for me it is ancient history. I do not intend to let up on the fact that the housing benefit bill is costing the public purse dear, and that is a national disgrace. The only way out of this spiral is increased housing supply. Whether young people are trying to get on to the housing ladder or trying to rent a social home, councils must be permitted to build more affordable homes. That is the most efficient way. They must also be allowed to insist that 50% of all newly built homes are genuinely affordable, not with rents at 80% of the market rate. That is utterly unaffordable for average or middle-income households. To date, in the current Parliament, I have not heard anyone make a commitment to addressing the crucial issue of housing supply. We ignore it at our peril, but that is symptomatic of the tin ear of this Administration when it comes to investment in vital housing infrastructure-and, for that matter, any kind of infrastructure. There is also the crucial issue of social mobility for our young people, which our society desperately lacks. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for indulging me in my first speech in Parliament. I look forward to standing up for the people of Hornsey and Wood Green, challenging the housing inequality in our society, and fighting for the things that matter.",69100,[],Housing,0,124,housing,950

2015-06-10,Housing,375,Suella Fernandes,Con,False,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. In the interests of time, I will rapidly condense my planned speech. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West) on speaking eloquently and passionately about her constituency, and about what she hopes to achieve in the House. I wish her well. I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp) on an excellent maiden speech. He spoke about real aspiration, hard work and getting on, which are key values of his and guiding principles of this Conservative Government. I have no doubt that he will make an invaluable contribution during his time in the House. I must declare an interest, as a barrister specialising in planning law who has represented local planning authorities and house builders at planning inquiries.â€œHousing is the first of the social services. It is also one of the keys to increased productivity. Work, family life, health and education are all undermined by crowded houses.â€Those words are taken from the Conservative manifesto of 1951. The 1951 election, about which we have heard a great deal today, was narrowly won by Winston Churchill, who appointed Harold Macmillan as his Housing Minister. Macmillan achieved great feats, delivering more than 300,000 houses between 1952 and 1953 alone. He achieved that by liberating the market and providing incentives for house ownership, and he increased supply considerably. Thirty years on, Margaret Thatcher and Lord Heseltine achieved the same with the right to buy, and today, another 30 years on, I am proud to be part of a Conservative Government who are continuing that tradition of home ownership, helping people who are working hard, counting their pennies and saving in order to afford a home for their families-all in the name of responsibility, aspiration and the securing of a financial future. The facts speak for themselves. Housing completions have increased hugely. Some 200,000 new starter homes and the Help to Buy ISAs are directly helping first-time buyers get on to the housing ladder. In my constituency, a total of 258 new homes were started in 2014. It is crucial that sufficient schools and infrastructure are provided to meet demand. The hypocrisy on the Labour Benches is astonishing given the present-day failure. Let us look at Wales: Labour-run Wales has a paltry delivery record on home ownership, and has the lowest house building rate per capita of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom. In the UK overall house building increased by 28% in 2013, but it declined by 12% in Wales. Rent controls, which are being used in Sweden and New York, are failing. They are socially divisive and are decreasing supply. I am proud to say that housing is the key to social mobility. It is the building block for social justice and it is at the heart of aspiration. Both the achievements of the last five years and the programme for the future are well thought-through plans of which Macmillan would be proud.",69100,[],Housing,0,126,housing,496
2015-06-10,Housing,376,Roberta Blackman-Woods,Lab,False,"I welcome you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to your new role. It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair. It has been an interesting-but quite short-debate. I congratulate in particular the Members who made their maiden speeches. The hon. Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp) spoke passionately about the achievements of his constituents and his predecessors. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich South (Clive Lewis) reminded us of the importance of increasing the diversity of Parliament and this Chamber. He conjured up an amazing image of cathedrals and castles in Norwich and of their being defiant against injustice, which I am sure we would all want to emulate. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds East (Richard Burgon) spoke very movingly about the wide range of issues facing his constituents and how the actions of this Government and the previous Government are exacerbating them. He did a very good job in speaking up for all his constituents and speaking about the support they need and are not getting from this Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West) gave a moving speech. She reminded us of the problems facing â€œgeneration rentâ€ and the difficulty young people have in getting into the housing market, the need to promote social mobility and, especially in London, the need to address rising house prices, which are putting housing beyond the reach of so many. Elsewhere in the debate we heard a wonderful speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck), who highlighted the particular problems of housing in London and the need to breathe new life into shared ownership. The hon. Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge) made some interesting points about the need to reform buy to let and I will be interested to see how those on his Front Bench respond to them. The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies) made some interesting points about the need to do more to promote neighbourhood planning and ensure that infrastructure is in place to support new housing-a point emphasised by the hon. Member for Fareham (Suella Fernandes).",69100,[],Housing,0,127,housing,354

2015-06-10,Housing,378,Roberta Blackman-Woods,Lab,False,"My hon. Friend makes an excellent point; it is one that we made a number of times when we were opposing the Government's changes to section 106 agreements. Those changes are incredibly short-sighted and will lead to a long-term dearth of the infrastructure that our country so desperately needs. Our housing market is in crisis because the Government are failing to build the homes that our country needs. We need 245,000 homes to be built every year in England alone, just to keep up with demand, but only 125,000 new homes were built in England between April 2014 and March 2015. Recent figures from an LSE report demonstrate clearly that house building figures were much lower under the coalition Government than under the previous Labour Administration. Indeed, house building fell during that time to its lowest level since the 1920s. Between 2011 and 2014, the total shortfall against the need for new homes was a massive 515,000. This has led to record numbers of young people in their 20s and 30s living with their parents. Analysis by the estate agent Savills has shown that in areas such as the south-east, where there is high demand and a strong employment market, approvals for new builds areâ€œfalling well below objectively assessed needâ€. In other words, even the homes that are being built are not necessarily in the places with the most acute housing need. As a result of the Government's continuing failure to tackle barriers to housing supply, prices are continuing to rise, reflecting sky-high demand. Even though there is deflation in other parts of the economy, the annual rate of house-price inflation is now 8.6%. House prices have outstripped wage inflation and hit an affordability ceiling in all parts of the country, with figures for last year showing a salary-to-house-price ratio of 10 times across the UK. Houses are unaffordable right across the country, with a rate of seven times in the north-west and 14 times in London. As prices are pushed beyond the reach of an increasing majority of us, home ownership has fallen to a 30-year low.",69100,[],Housing,0,129,housing,348

2015-06-10,Housing,380,Roberta Blackman-Woods,Lab,False,"Indeed; my hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme is also stuttering to a halt, with completions falling by 43% in the last quarter of last year and at the beginning of this one. The record on private renting is no better. For renters who aspire to home ownership, the future poses huge challenges. Around 11 million people are now renting privately. They are not just young people trying to get on to the housing ladder: 1.4 million of them are families with children, and almost half of private renters are over the age of 35. The undersupply of private rented homes is making housing unaffordable for many, particularly those who rely on that sector. Rents are rising, and between 2008-09 and 2013-14, the mean average private rent increased from Â£153 a week to Â£176 a week-an increase of 15%. The increase in London was 21%. What are the Government doing about this? Absolutely nothing. Indeed, the previous Conservative chairman, the right hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), denied that private rents were rising, much to the incredulity of Labour Members. The Tories' record on social renting is no better. In 2013-14, only 10,840 social rented homes were delivered. That was a 71% decrease from the 37,000 delivered in 2012-13. Furthermore, despite Government promises to replace every home sold through the right to buy, that simply did not happen-for every 10 sold, only one had started to be built to replace them. The Government therefore have real questions to answer about their extension of the right to buy scheme. In particular, we must have better answers about how the extended scheme will be financed. Selling off expensive council houses to fund the policy will mean that, for some areas of London and for other inner cities too, all council housing might need to be sold, with like-for-like replacement unlikely to be achieved. That point was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan). I look forward to hearing from the Minister how the scheme is to be financed.

Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry) made a great contribution and gave some superb ideas for us to look into. He rightly outlined the work that we have done for family-friendly tenancies with the model tenancy agreement that the Government launched in the previous Parliament. I look forward to working with him over the months ahead to ensure that we will do what we can to deliver homes for people throughout our country and across tenures. In particular, I wish to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp) on his maiden speech. He made a good start in the House by respecting the comments of Mr Deputy Speaker and keeping himself short and tight in his words, while outlining his clear passion for his area and his experience as a man from London, although I would question his loyalty to Crystal Palace football club. I am a supporter of Queen's Park Rangers, so that might be one area where we fail to agree, but his passion and knowledge of housing will be a great contribution to the House, particularly his clear passion for the use of public sector and brownfield land. The hon. Member for Norwich South (Clive Lewis), one of my new neighbours as a fellow Norfolk MP, gave an interesting maiden speech, with an interesting outline of the Norwich that I know best as the city of ale, as I am a former pubs Minister. I look forward to him joining us in putting pressure on Labour-run Norwich City Council to use the powers and money that it has to build council houses in Norwich. I have met the council about that and I encourage him to join me in nagging it to go further. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge) for a thoughtful speech. He outlined some of the issues and problems left by the Labour party because of its failure to regulate properly, which led to some of the problems in the economic crash that Labour gave us just before it lost its majority in Parliament in 2010. The hon. Member for Leeds East (Richard Burgon) in his speech outlined his 100-year family background in the area, which he is clearly and rightly proud of. I am pleased that he, along with other Members, has given a clear message to the House that he has a focus on housing. I am sure that he will want to join me in congratulating the Leeds area on having the highest number of beneficiaries of the equity loan Help to Buy scheme in the entire country, for which it can thank a Conservative-led Government. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies) on another excellent and thoughtful contribution, which outlined the importance of local plans. She rightly seeks to ensure that absolute pressure is put on her local authority to deliver a local plan to serve the constituents she has been elected to represent. I hope that the council will have listened to her speech and taken note, and will deliver that local plan which it so badly needs and should rightly deliver for its residents. The hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound) gave a typically robust, if a little far-fetched, outline of the Government's policies, but I look forward to debating with him further when we come to the housing Bill later this year. Yes, it was not a maiden speech, but it was close. My hon. Friend the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse) made a thoughtful and helpful contribution, as I know he will do throughout his time in this Parliament. As with my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen, I particularly noted his comments about rural exception sites, and we will come back to that as part of the housing Bill in due course. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West) on her maiden speech, in which she paid a clear tribute to her predecessor. Again, I thank her for showing that she will have a clear focus on housing, and I hope she will join me in making sure we deliver the housing we need across our country. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Suella Fernandes) for giving a short but insightful speech, supporting good-quality development and highlighting the poor delivery of housing under the last Labour Government. I am fortunate, as the Minister for Housing and Planning, to be able to build on excellent work done by my predecessors, including my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk), who did fantastic groundwork on the private rented sector, setting it up to be the strong and growing sector it is today, and in his general work on housing. My hon. Friends the Members for Henley (John Howell) and for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) have also contributed through work on neighbourhood planning and on the NPPF. My neighbour, the hon. Member for South Norfolk, has done fantastic work on custom-build and right to build. That is all contributing and will go on to contribute further to build the homes we need across our country. I was surprised at a couple of things said by the Opposition Front Benchers, not least because we are still not entirely clear-I do not know whether any Labour Members are-about whether they support or do not support the aspiration to own that people who benefit from right to buy will have. Conservative Members absolutely support that. It is deeply ironic, at best, that the Opposition have called today's debate at all, in order to raise the alarm about the housing crisis that they created. It is a little like listening to the arsonist ringing the fire brigade to report a house that they burned to the ground. Let us remember where we have come from: in 2010, they left this country with the lowest level of peacetime house building rates since 1923, with millions of first-time buyers locked out of the market and-let us be clear about this-with a net loss of some 420,000 affordable houses. That was a shameful track record to leave this country. Let us contrast that with what has happened during the past five years of a Conservative-led Government. We have had the job of clearing up the mess, and progress has been made. Labour Members may not like to hear this, but let me give them some facts. Housing starts and the number of first-time buyers have doubled since 2009, and those continue to rise. Councils are building at the fastest rate in 23 years; just five years of a Conservative-led coalition built more social housing than 13 years of Labour. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State rightly said, we were the first Government since the 1980s to finish with a larger stock of affordable homes than we started with. We plan for a brighter and a bigger future, which the Opposition cannot come to terms with. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has set out a clear goal and a clear mission for him and for us in this Parliament, which is to ensure that everyone who works hard can aspire to have a home of their own. More than 1 million tenants in housing association properties will be helped to buy a home. Some 200,000 starter homes will be built with a 20% discount for first-time buyers, and 95,000 homes will be built on brownfield land. We will help communities to have more control over house building and we will build 275,000 more affordable homes, which is the fastest rate in more than 20 years. As my right hon. Friend said, we have a rich legacy on which to draw. Today we have heard the difference between a Government with plans to fulfil housing goals and an Opposition who want to frustrate them. We are offering working people a ladder, and the Opposition are telling them to form a queue. We will build more homes that people can afford. We will make it easier for local people to build the homes they need for the future in the places they want to build them. Above all, we will support the aspirations of working people who want to buy a home of their own.",69100,[],Housing,0,136,housing,1410
2015-12-15,Housing,330,John Healey,Lab,False,"I beg to move, That this House notes that the Government's record on housing is one of five years of failure with rising homelessness, falling home-ownership, escalating rents, deep cuts in investment and the lowest level of house-building since the 1920s; further notes that the Spending Review and Autumn Statement will not result in the homes that young people and families on ordinary incomes need being built because it cuts the level of investment from that of 2010 and fails to prioritise genuinely affordable homes to rent and buy; notes Shelter Scotland's report of September 2015, Affordable Housing Need in Scotland, which states that overall house-building levels are well below their peak in 2007 and that the number of new social homes built has fallen by 44 per cent from 2010 to 2014; notes the widespread concern that the Government's Housing and Planning Bill will lead to the severe loss of affordable homes, will be a let-down for aspiring home-owners, and will do nothing to help England's private renters struggling with poor conditions and high renting costs; and calls on the Government to help families who are struggling with the cost of housing, including by building more affordable homes to rent and buy. Above schools, wages, crime, foreign affairs and terrorism, people now place housing as their most pressing concern. It is fourth in Ipsos MORI's latest long-running â€œIssues Facing Britainâ€ survey. In all parts of this House, we know of the increasing pressure, frustration and sometimes despair that our constituents feel when a decent, affordable home to rent or buy is totally beyond them. That is why we have called today's debate on the Government's record on housing. It is a truly shameful record, with five years of failure on every front. For the Housing Minister, who I know is a fan of social media, we could call it #fiveyearsoffailure. There have been five years of failure on homelessness- -which, despite the laughter of Conservative Members, we all feel keenly at Christmas. Rough sleeping has increased by more than half in the past five years, while statutory homelessness is up by more than a third and is rising rapidly. There have been five years of failure on home ownership. The rate of home ownership has fallen each and every year since 2010, and the total number of home-owning households in this country is now more than 200,000 fewer than when the Tories took control. It is young people who are being hit the hardest, with the number of homeowners under the age of 35 down by a fifth in the past five years. There have been five years of failure on private rents. While incomes have stagnated, private rents on new lets have soared-up by Â£1,400 a year-since 2010. There have been five years of failure on housing benefit costs, which rose by Â£4.3 billion in the last Parliament, despite punishing cuts such as the bedroom tax, even as housing investment was slashed.

At this point in the political cycle, we need to look at what is ahead. Two areas demonstrate the direction that the Tory Government are taking on housing and serve as a warning of what is to come. The first is a systematic attack on housing opportunity for young people and families on ordinary incomes, the very people the housing market is failing most at the moment. Ministers have launched a full-frontal assault on council and housing association homes which will hit those on low and middle incomes hardest. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said that the result of both the Budget and the autumn statement together will be 34,000 fewer housing association homes built. Meanwhile, the Housing and Planning Bill strangles the ability and obligation of both private and public sectors to build the affordable homes to rent and to buy that are badly needed in both urban and rural areas alike. In addition there is an extraordinary forced sell-off of council homes to fund an extension of the right to buy, with no prospect or commitment, as Labour has urged, of like-for-like, one-for-one replacements in the local area. I have to say that in many areas of the country, both rural and urban but especially in London, these council homes will go not to families struggling to buy, but to speculators, second homeowners, and buy-to-let landlords-and of course the greater the demand for affordable housing in an area, the higher the value of the houses, and the more the Chancellor will take in his annual levy.",70534,[],Housing,0,31,housing,278

My fear for the future is that when Labour gets back into government, we will be faced with a similar legacy of neglect of our council housing. Over the next five years, we look ahead to a huge loss of affordable homes to rent and to buy in this country. In total, the Chartered Institute of Housing expects the loss of 195,000 affordable homes for social rent over the next five years. On top of this, in the very last sitting of the Housing and Planning Bill Committee, Ministers introduced plans to scrap the secure tenancies that Margaret Thatcher herself brought in for council tenants, restricting them instead to fixed-term tenancies of between two and five years.

Why do they not start by funding their policy with Government support, instead of taking it, like some medieval baron, from councils because their coffers are empty? Ministers made much of starter homes and there is clearly a need for more affordable homes to buy, especially given that the number has fallen in the past five years by nearly 30%. However, the Government's starter homes will be a non-starter for families on ordinary incomes. Shelter calculates that, across the country, one would need an annual income of around Â£50,000 and a deposit of Â£40,000 to afford a starter home. In London, one would need an income of Â£77,000 and a deposit of Â£98,000. That is simply out of reach for most of those on middle incomes-working families, who need help to buy the most. Of course, there are no controls to stop those who can afford to buy without help from the Government taking advantage of the scheme.

They do not like it, they do not believe it, they do not trust Ministers, but they signed up to it because it is the least worst option for them. With so many people's dreams of buying their own home out of reach, Ministers have responded by announcing plans to fiddle the figures again, by changing the definition of affordable homes to include so-called starter homes for sale at up to Â£450,000. That is an insult to young people and families on ordinary incomes, and a mockery of common sense and sound policy. It is like the Health Minister tackling the GP shortage by reclassifying cashiers at Boots pharmacy as qualified doctors. The second area that demonstrates the direction that the Government are taking in this Parliament is the systematic side-lining of local people and local decision making. Whatever they say, Ministers' actions are anti-localist. At every turn since the election, housing policy has been set to undermine the say of local people and override their local representatives. The Housing and Planning Bill puts 33 new centralising powers in the hands of the Secretary of State, from directing starter homes to be built instead of affordable homes, to fixing rents for so-called high-income tenants. Those powers include a legalised annual cash grab from councils, which totally undermines their ability to plan for housing need in their area. The Bill also rips up the contract of localising local finance for housing, which until this point has been the subject of all-party support. Ministers will have sweeping new powers to award â€œautomatic planning permissionâ€-the so-called â€œpermission in principleâ€. That is not, as the House has been led to believe, simply a policy for dealing with brownfield sites; it is a power and policy for any site allocated for use in a local plan. There will be no need to apply for full planning permission, no limitations on what sort of development can be built, and no planning gain or obligation on developers. Only the technical details will be left for the elected local planning authorities to deal with. A host of organisations now echo Labour's concerns about such open-ended powers, including the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Friends of the Earth and the Woodland Trust.

2015-12-15,Housing,376,John Healey,Lab,False,"The hon. Gentleman is a master of distraction. I am making a point about clause 1 of the Bill, and he has enough experience to know what is at stake.

If the Minister wants those powers, he should justify that in this House and the other place during the passage of the Bill, or tighten them up so that they do what he says he wants them to do. I look forward to the Minister's response on that point, but I am not holding my breath. In the housing world the Minister has become known as â€œMr Million Homesâ€. He said:â€œBy the end of this Parliament success would mean that we have seen a build in total of something like a million homesâ€. In other words, an average of 200,000 homes a year. Now we know that the Minister is prone to a bit of bullish bluster, but that is going some. In his first year as Housing Minister, not 200,000, but 115,590 homes were built. Last year-the best year out of the previous Government's five years-only 117,720 homes were built. The total number of homes built in that Government's best year was still lower than in the worst year of the Labour Government's 13 years, which was in the depths of the global banking crisis and recession. Even the Prime Minister has not gone as far as the Minister. In conclusion, no Government can sit back and see a whole generation priced out of a decent home, and call themselves a â€œone nationâ€ Government. No political party can say nothing in their manifesto to the 11 million people living in private rented accommodation, and call itself a â€œparty of aspirationâ€. No party can have a programme that will lead to a huge loss of genuinely affordable housing, and call itself the â€œparty of working peopleâ€.

We are the first Government since the 1980s to finish a term of office with a higher stock of affordable homes than we started with. I gently remind the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne, who has set out his preference for council house building, that twice as many council homes were built in the past five years of our Government than were built during 13 years of the Labour Government. More new council housing was started in London last year than during the whole of the Labour Government, shocking as that may seem. In all, Â£20 billion was invested over the course of the last Parliament, achieving the same rate of affordable house building with half the rate of grant as under the Labour Government.

2015-12-15,Housing,415,Brandon Lewis,Con,False,"I will make a bit more progress and then I will take more interventions. For the reasons that I have given, in the spending review we announced the biggest investment in housing for 40 years. We are determined to invest in what matters most to young people and to British families. We want to pay off Labour's debt and make sure we build the homes our country needs. Both are required to make this the turnaround decade. In the spending review, the Chancellor said, â€œWe choose housingâ€ and delivered a further Â£20 billion. Our work will include: major investments in large-scale projects, such as Ebbsfleet garden city, Bicester, Barking riverside and Northstowe; Â£7.5 billion to extend the Help to Buy equity loan scheme until 2021; and supporting the purchase of 145,000 new build homes. In London, we are doubling the value of equity loans to 40%, providing the capital's aspiring home owners with a better chance to buy. A new Help to Buy ISA is helping buyers across the country to save for a deposit. The brand new Help to Buy shared ownership will deliver a further 135,000 homes by removing many of the restrictions that have held back shared ownership. For example, an aspiring home owner in Yorkshire can get on the housing ladder with a deposit of just Â£1,400. I am sure the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) will be encouraging his constituents to apply. Let me provide the House with some clear examples of why this matters. In the south-east, a deposit could be as low as Â£2,400, and in London Â£3,400. Our plans for shared ownership will make 175,000 more people eligible for home ownership. Just last week, the Prime Minister visited a family in Burton and I visited one in Didcot. They were excited for the future and the possibilities home ownership opens up to them. These possibilities will be open to anyone of any occupation as long as they earn under Â£80,000, or Â£90,000 in London. We will provide other opportunities for working people, too: a Â£1 billion housing delivery fund to support small and custom builders; Â£8 billion to build 450,000 affordable homes; 100,000 homes for affordable rent; and, yes, 200,000 affordable homes will be starter homes available to young first-time buyers, with a 20% discount. That is the largest affordable housebuilding programme for many decades. Starter homes will be transformational. Opposition Members may laugh and pour scorn on starter homes, and go against the aspirations of first-time buyers, but I ask Members across the House just to pause and think for a moment. A first-time buyer getting a 20% discount on a new home, linking that with a 5% deposit thanks to Help to Buy, saves thousands. For example, a two-bedroom home in Durham-in the constituency of the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr Blackman-Woods)-can be bought for just under Â£150,000. With 20% off, that will be Â£120,000.

We are clear that we must go further and faster in all areas of housing supply. The Housing and Planning Bill is part of that, and it will give housebuilders and local decision makers the tools and confidence to deliver more homes. I know that Members of all parties will want building on brownfield land to be the first choice at all times. Under this Government, brownfield land will be prioritised. New homes will be built near existing residents, so that their green belt and local countryside is protected. Regenerating eyesores and derelict land to create modern homes for the next generation is the opportunity that lies ahead of us. A new statutory register of brownfield land will provide up-to-date and publicly available information on land suitable for housing. Forty brownfield housing zones are being created across the country, including 20 in London. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the Mayor of London, for working with us to deliver those homes in London. We want to see planning permissions in place for 90% of these sites by 2020.

Smaller firms in particular will benefit from quicker and simpler ways of establishing where and what they can build, especially with the new â€œpermission in principleâ€ for sites on the brownfield register. The Bill will ensure that the planning system helps to drive our increased aims for the supply of houses. During the last Parliament, we reformed and streamlined the failing top-down planning system.

What we are seeing through this local system is that trusting local people and moving away from the top-down days of Labour's past is working. We are seeing people develop their own plans for house building, and the system is faster and more efficient. Since 2010, the number of planning permissions for new homes has increased by 50%, and the number of local plans has more than doubled. Meanwhile, neighbourhood planning has captured the imagination of communities across the country. Following the holding of 125 referendums, each plan was approved by democratic mandate. I know that not every authority has reached the stage that we would like them all to reach with their local plans, but if plans are not in place by 2017, the Government will work with local people to ensure that that happens, so that all local areas have the plans that they want for the homes that they need. We have come a long way since the great housing crash of the last decade, when house building was in real danger of stopping altogether. We made the tough decisions to get Britain building again. We are still clearing up the mess that we were left, but now we are moving from rescue to recovery and thence to revival. Our investment in house building during the current Parliament is the largest for 40 years. We are determined to deliver a better housing market that secures our economic recovery, boosts productivity and rebalances the economy. Our plans go far beyond numbers, schemes and timelines; they are about people and their hopes and dreams; they are about supporting their aspirations and giving them the confidence that their hard work can be rewarded with home ownership and a place to raise their families.

2015-12-15,Housing,435,Alan Brown,SNP,False,"The motion is about a scattergun approach to a very important topic. I understand it is aimed mainly at the last five years of the coalition Government and the direction they took. Of course, a standard one-line dig is now levelled at the SNP Scottish Government, as if that is somehow going to transform Labour's fortunes north of the border. Current policy ties in with decades of housing policy of Governments of all hues. There is no doubt that the roots of the current housing crisis stem from the Housing Act 1980-an Act that Labour contemplated introducing before it lost power-which led to the decimation of housing stock across the UK as a whole, the biggest problem being that those houses were not replaced. The reason they were not replaced was that the moneys from the sale of stock were either used to offset debt or reclaimed by the Treasury, so it was impossible for councils to replace stock. Fast-forwarding to Scotland now, the SNP has recognised this issue. That is why we scrapped the right to buy. As of this year, the right to buy council houses has been eliminated in Scotland. We are also opposed to the extension of the right to buy to housing associations. By removing the right to buy and opposing it in housing associations, we preserve stock and allow better targeted new building of social housing to meet local housing needs. Labour had 13 years in power in the UK but did not do that and Labour did not do it in Scotland when it was in power for eight years. Labour could have invested in a council house building programme but, like the Tories, in the main chose to leave affordable housing to the markets and to social landlords. We have heard about the sorry state of affairs whereby the coalition Government actually built more council housing in five years than Labour did in 13. On the council housing theme, I point out that in Scotland the Scottish National party has now delivered more than 6,000 council houses, which compares to a grand total of six that Labour delivered when it was in power. I said that right, the figures are 6,000 versus six. There is no doubt that greater council house building just makes more sense. Councils can borrow at a lower rate, they can use their land supply and they can target regeneration. Those were all things I was pleased to be involved with as a councillor for East Ayrshire Council. Given the increased discounts put in by the coalition Government for right to buy, what council in England is going to invest in council house building in the future, as its stock will be at risk of getting sold off? The same goes for the extended right to buy in respect of housing associations. They will not be able to borrow securely when they no longer know accurately what their future rent projection will be. Clearly, they could build houses but those could then be sold off, which distorts the whole model that housing associations were built on. Let me now deal with one-to-one replacement. Despite what we heard from the Minister for Housing and Planning, it is a complete sham. It is based on a three-year cycle, and I understand that that is to allow for planning and getting houses coming out of the ground. The Government say that they have already achieved the one-to-one, but they are comparing the first year's right-to-buy sales with the replacements over a three-year period. There has been a massive increase in the right-to-buy sales since then. The Library briefing paper shows that to stay on track against the increased number of right-to-buy sales, 4,650 houses need to be built every six months. In the first six months of this year, there were only 730 starts and acquisitions, so for the first six months of this year the Government have achieved only 15% of that required target. There is therefore no doubt that going forward the one-to-one replacement will not happen. When that is combined with the forced sale of the highest-value council properties, it is clear that this Government are going to create a worse housing situation in the long term, rather than do something to sort it, despite all the bluster we have heard. There is still no definition of what one-to-one replacement is. The target is a national one, so it does not compel councils and housing associations to replace houses locally. It means that local needs and supply assessments do not govern the replacement strategy or housing strategy, whereas in Scotland the local needs and supply assessments are a prerequisite of Government funding The SNP Government, when funding social housing and council housing, are making sure that they take local needs and assessments into account. That is a proper strategic overview, which is the only way in which housing stock can be managed. Another major issue I have with the right-to-buy policy is that councils are forced to subsidise home ownership through the sales programme as well as fund the rebuild without any Government money being added. Monetary experts agree that this is the time to invest in infrastructure, and clearly housing is integral to infrastructure. If the Government used the Â£10 billion to Â£12 billion subsidy that is getting used for right to buy for housing associations, we could create additional housing. That would help to tackle the housing problem, it would create more jobs and it would lead to a more sustainable model. If the Government were actually willing to put money up front, that would also lead to Barnett consequentials for Scotland, and I know that the SNP Government would use that wisely. The right-to-buy measure in effect privatises housing associations. I draw a parallel with what happened during an early reading of the Scotland Bill when a proposal was made to devolve the Crown Estate. The hon. Member for North East Somerset (Mr Rees-Mogg) made an impassioned defence of the Crown Estate on the basis of the principle of not imposing a change of ownership. No Conservative Member is willing to come to the defence of housing associations, yet it is the same forced change of ownership. Under the right to buy, large family houses have all but disappeared from council stock in some areas, and private renting has had to increase to compensate. That drives up housing benefit costs, which is counterproductive for the taxpayer in the long run. Many sold properties end up in the rented sector, especially flatted properties. Someone exercises the right to buy. Then they die; the flat is passed on to family and the family have no need for it. It ends up as a buy-to-let and the taxpayer pays more money for someone to rent that property than for the person in the council house next door. In a study by Glasgow university, this is estimated to have cost the taxpayer an extra Â£3 million a year in Renfrewshire alone. We also know that 40% of flats in England sold under the right to buy have ended up in the buy-to-let market. Clearly, that will only increase under the extended right to buy for housing association tenants. We heard in the autumn statement of an additional levy on people who buy additional homes. That is supposed to provide some income to the Treasury and have a balancing effect on the buy-to-let market, but there is no doubt that it will not do anything. It will give the Treasury a wee bit more money, but the returns that buy-to-let landlords get will at least offset that one-off levy. So the taxpayer will still pay more money in the long run in housing benefit. Going forward, it is almost guaranteed that the only way the housing benefit bill will be reduced is if the Government take further punitive measures. I think I have made it clear that I am against extending the right to buy to housing association tenants. It will lead to social cleansing-to a clearing out of people.",70534,[],Housing,0,106,housing,1350

2015-12-15,Housing,437,Alan Brown,SNP,False,"They might do in the short term, but I can guarantee that they will get money from the taxpayer as a discount, then they will sell the property. Property developers will move in, they will demolish and rebuild and there will be an ongoing moving out of people. The social houses will not be rebuilt in that area so people on lower incomes will not be able to rent in the area that they were staying in. I think I should be pleased. I am getting a wee bit of chunter, and that is maybe a good thing. Affordable homes clearly need to be truly affordable. The SNP Government have made sure that that is the case, and it is part of our plan going forward. It is not the case here in London. A cursory glance at my local estate agent in Kennington where I have a flat for when I stay down here shows that the costs for one-bedroom flats are truly mind-blowing. I can understand why London has a housing crisis. In Scotland the SNP Government have delivered 30,000 affordable homes since 2011, backed by Â£1.7 billion of investment and they are committed to 50,000 affordable homes, of which 70% will be available for social rent, if they are re-elected. Despite what the motion says, I can inform the House that the chief executive of Shelter Scotland has welcomed this commitment. We have had no such commitment from Labour as yet in Scotland. Although we are against the extended right to buy, we are not against home ownership. I accept that many families welcomed the original right to buy and many people have benefited from it. However, the scheme has had its time and it is time to move on. The rhetoric comes back to whether we are for or against home ownership, but that is not the right message. I have concerns that the UK Government proposals for Help to Buy and right to buy will encourage more people to borrow. At present interest rates are at an all-time low, so homes may be on the cusp of affordability. People can borrow now, but when interest rates go up there will be a risk to the affordability of those homes. Although the Government talk about reducing borrowing, the one-for-one replacement scheme is funded by additional borrowing by councils and housing associations. As we now know, housing associations are adding to the public debt and are on the public books, so there is no benefit from what the Government are doing. The long-term economic recovery plan appears to give a discount to home owners, but it will increase personal debt and force borrowing elsewhere for replacement housing. All in all, it is not a plan at all. To meet people's requirements, we need more houses to be built, based on local need and demand. Those must be truly affordable homes that are energy efficient. This would deliver health benefits and reduce the long-term housing benefit bill. A house building programme would create jobs, improve the welfare bill as more people would be working, and improve the Treasury's income. That is the strategic plan that the Government should work to. It is one that the Scottish Government are doing their best to implement and they certainly will do so if re-elected next year.",70534,[],Housing,0,108,housing,555

We have a broken model, and it is this Government who are seeking to fix it. What I find so depressing from the Labour Benches is the paucity of ideas, the sheer paucity of radicalism. Almost every amendment proposed from the Opposition Benches during the Committee stage of the Housing and Planning Bill would have had the effect of slowing things down-sand in the gears, a spanner in the works. Labour Members do not seem to recognise that they are seeking to make the central problem-the problem of supply-even worse. Last week Kevin McCloud addressed the all-party self-build, custom-build and independent house building group at our No. 10 summit, and I am very pleased that he was able to do so. He said:â€œThe consumer has been on the receiving end of a pretty poor deal. We build some of the poorest, most expensive and smallest houses in Europe. That's not something to celebrate.â€Yet according to Ipsos MORI, 53% of the adult population would like to build a house at some point, 30% would like to do so in the next five years, and more than 1 million people would like to buy a site and start in the next 12 months. This can be done at scale. Adri Duivesteijn in Almere in the Netherlands has proved that it can be done, with serviced plots for over 3,000 dwellings. Cherwell District Council is now doing it in Oxfordshire, with over 1,900 serviced plots. This is the way to help supply rise to meet demand, putting the customer at the centre. Chapter 2 of the Housing and Planning Bill, on self-build and custom house building, will make that happen. The right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne did not mention chapter 2 or self-build and custom house building. There are very legitimate reasons why local authorities might want to have and maintain affordable housing. In my view, they could and should use some of their Â£22 billion of reserves to establish, promote and grow mutual housing co-operatives for affordable rent. That is completely normal in Berlin, where it is called genossenschaften, and elsewhere on the continent. These arrangements are not relevant in terms of right to buy because they involve people entering into contracts with each other to form part of a co-operative. I thought there was a thing called the Co-operative party, but we heard nothing about this in the Bill Committee; I was the one talking about it. Interestingly, the local authority leader who showed the most interest in it when asked about in-perpetuity social rents in big cities was the Conservative leader of Westminster council, Philippa Roe, who said very seriously, yet with a gleam in her eye, â€œYes, we're looking at that.â€ From Labour Members, I am afraid we heard nothing. We need vision and imagination, and the Bill will make that easier to achieve. Instead of building the most poorly performing, most expensive and smallest homes in Europe, we should do things differently. We should use our imagination and our knowledge to make the best places that we can, with the best-performing homes that we know how to build, in the most beautiful surroundings that we know how to create, where people will be able to find an education, find the skills they need for life, find a job they enjoy, perhaps start their own business, put down roots, build a house or have someone build a house to their own design, raise a family, and be part of a community. These are all normal human aspirations. We have to make it normal to achieve them, so that housing supply rises to meet demand here in this country, just as it does in the rest of Europe.

2015-12-15,Housing,448,Julie Elliott,Lab,False,"No. Getting a home of their own is a dream too far; being able to self-build is absolutely out of the question. Since 2010 this Government have presided over the lowest level of homes built in peacetime since the 1920s. This fact does not become dulled by repetition. Since May, muddled thinking has given way to contradictory policies. The Government give with one hand and take away with another. The Chancellor's Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed in November's â€œEconomic and fiscal outlookâ€ that Government policies since the election will lead to 34,000 fewer housing association homes being built over the next five years. I share the Government's desire to create a property-owning democracy for those who want to own their own home. I can therefore only assume that the Secretary of State shares my disappointment that home ownership under this Government has fallen by over 200,000 to the lowest level in 30 years, below the EU average for the first time on record. To choose a period at random, from 1997 to 2010 the number of homeowners rose by more than 1 million. The rise of insecure working practices, such as zero-hours contracts and underemployment, has meant that many people cannot save for a deposit or get a mortgage, because they do not have a permanent contract. The state of social housing in many parts of the country is close to breaking point, with waiting lists of many years. If the Government are not sure why that might be the case, perhaps they could look back to 2014, when the number of homes built for social rent was at its lowest for at least two decades. The number of affordable homes provided in the past year fell by more than a quarter compared with 2010. This Government simply do not get social housing. I sat on the Localism Bill Committee in the last Parliament, when a Conservative member of the Committee referred to social housing as â€œhousing of last resort.â€ I was born in a council house and I grew up in that house and that community-it was my home. Council housing provides a safe, warm place for millions of people to call home. It is not housing of last resort. The proposal in the Housing and Planning Bill, which is currently going through this House, to scrap tenancies for life is a disgrace, and this Government should be ashamed for proposing such a change. This Government have made it harder to build social homes by choking the planning system. They have consistently watered down section 106 affordable homes requirements, while in his day job as Mayor of London, the hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson), who is no longer in his place, has banned Labour councils from insisting on the building of genuine social homes through section 106 agreements in his London plan. He did that against the guidance of the planning inspector, but with the approval of the former Communities and Local Government Secretary, the right hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Sir Eric Pickles). With home ownership an unobtainable ambition for many, and with social housing in short supply, it should come as no surprise that the private rented sector has enjoyed tremendous growth. Although there are many good private landlords who provide decent homes for their tenants, many other tenants endure daily instability and short-term tenancies-typically of six months-as well as poor standards and rent increases at a pace that outstrips wages. By every metric, and in whatever part of the housing sector, the situation has deteriorated in the past five years. I hope the Government can start to address the differing and diverse needs of families across this country with a comprehensive strategy that does more than simply manage decline.",70534,[],Housing,0,119,housing,628
2015-12-15,Housing,449,Stephen Hammond,Con,False,"It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Sunderland Central (Julie Elliott), but I have to say that my conclusion from looking at every metric is rather different from hers. The right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) opened in his usual way, but, behind his faÃ§ade of bluster, the only conclusion we can draw from the statistics is that the Labour party left a housing crisis in this country. Under that Government, house building was at its lowest level since the 1920s, while the housing available for social rent decreased and the number of those on the waiting list increased. There are a huge number of possible solutions to that problem, but Labour Members have offered a paucity of ideas. This Government have delivered for the past five years and they are continuing to do so. They are delivering 753,000 new homes and 260,000 more affordable homes, and council house building is now at its highest level for 23 years. The Mayor of London, who is not in his place but I was pleased to see him here earlier, has a record to be proud of. He is on track to deliver those 100,000 more affordable homes over his two terms. Being a London Member, I was also pleased that the Chancellor, in both the autumn statement and the Budget, ensured that there was housing news and opportunity across the country. In particular, I was delighted with the extension of the very successful Help to Buy scheme-which in the last Parliament helped 120,000 households to get on the ladder-to London. That will be really important for the other measures the Government are also putting in place in London to work. It is clear that this Government do not lack ambition and that they are not complacent. I heard the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne ask why the Government do not sell off some of their own land. In London, the London Land Commission is going to do exactly that, which will be hugely powerful in delivering extra affordable homes during the term of office of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith), when he takes over as Mayor of London. The Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr Jones), who is in his place, will know that the London Land Commission will undertake a review in a year's time. When he looks at that review, I hope he might contemplate giving the Mayor the power to impose a duty to co-operate-or, indeed, a power to have a first right of refusal-so that if any public or local authorities drag their feet and hold back the aspiration to provide houses for Londoners, they can very clearly be told that it is their duty to co-operate with the London Land Commission and to get on with the job. The Budget contained several measures that will be powerful in accelerating the number of houses likely to be built in our country. In particular, in-principle permission for brownfield sites will allow developers to bring forward sites much more quickly. It will enable them to understand what can be achieved in outline. Any number of large projects may benefit from that, but equally, so will any number of small projects. If developers have the confidence to know what they can do, they will invest in the technical detail, which will in turn lead to community support for community infrastructure-it may also create opportunities for self-build property, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) has reminded us-and that will provide the opportunity for quality developers to bring forward quality developments on brownfield sites. Yet, Opposition Members have told people waiting to move into such homes, â€œVote Labour- it won't happen.â€ It is very clear that there is a real difference between us on such ideas and aspirations. I know that the Minister is in the mood and has an appetite to deliver even more than the target of 1 million houses, so let me tell him that he could do a few other things. In particular, will he consider introducing a plan to allow small-scale developers-perhaps paying a small extra fee to accelerate the process-to fast-track small developments through the process more quickly? That would give us a real opportunity to bring on some of the smaller sites. We all want big developments, but small ones will help just as much. This Government are absolutely right to be taking action on housing, which is the most important issue for our country.

What we have seen under this Government-although it did not start in 2010, of course-is an erosion of the principle of security. That erosion reached its nadir with the proposal to scrap the security of tenure for social housing. The proposal to scrap secure social tenancies will mean an intrusion into the lives of the poorest, and only the poorest, every few years as they are required to justify their home. The principle of security is being eroded in many other ways. There has been a doubling in the number of families who are bringing up children in private rented housing, where they can only rely on a 12-month assured shorthold tenancy. The Government refuse to do anything to address the desperate need for longer security for people in the private rented sector. There has been an increase in homelessness. It was coming down for many years from too high a peak under the last Labour Government, but it is soaring again. There has been a fantastic 820% increase in the number of families being held illegally in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Families are living, sometimes for years, in nightly booked temporary accommodation after they have been homeless. That has happened to my constituents. Insecurity is the new normal, but only for the poorest. Far from addressing that crisis, the Government plan to extend it and entrench it even more widely. The stories of my constituents and the constituents of everybody on the Opposition Benches-and, quite possibly, the stories of the constituents of Government Members that go unheard-are stories of people torn away from their children's schools, torn away from their parents, torn away from the people they have caring responsibilities for, torn away from the volunteering they do, torn away from their part-time or even full-time jobs and torn away from their communities. It is their children, above all, who suffer. The hyper-mobility that is forced on families at the moment is bringing about worse physical health, worse mental health, higher suicide risks and worse educational achievement. We are entrenching that into the lives of the poorest. Sadly, I do not have time to tell some of those stories, although I would love to be able to do so. We know not just from the anecdotes, but from academic research that has been done in Australia and America, just how damaging this is. Communities suffer as well as individuals when the people who are the building blocks of communities-people who are registered to vote and who are civic participants-can no longer be so because they are forced again and again to move house. They are forced to move house every six months or every year, and now social tenants will be forced to move house every three or four years. I will finish with a quotation from Professor Steve Hilditch, who for over 40 years has been an academic, a manager and a deliverer of housing. He says in respect of the end of secure social tenancies:â€œSocial rented housing is our most precious housing asset. Its existence broke the historic inevitability that people on low incomes and vulnerable people would also endure homelessness and dreadful housing conditions. It removed the blight of bad housing from generations of children. In my view it was the strongest mechanism of all to achieve genuine social mobility and to give children born into poor families similar opportunities to those enjoyed by better-off families.â€",70534,[],Housing,0,123,housing,581
2015-12-15,Housing,453,Robin Walker,Con,False,"I am grateful to the Opposition for calling a debate on affordable housing, because it gives me the opportunity to point out the very different records of Labour and my party in both national and local government in supplying affordable homes in Worcester. Affordable housing is one of the most pressing and important issues for me, as the MP for Worcester. It is the single most commonly raised concern at my surgeries. Although Worcester has seen nothing like the price inflation that has been seen in the south-east, the price of housing is a major worry for young people, whether they are students and apprentices setting out to rent or young professionals looking to buy their first home. In our beautiful county town, a city of about 100,000 people, there is rightly pressure to build affordable homes on brownfield rather than greenfield sites, both to protect the stunning Worcestershire countryside, which is such an asset to our county, and to defend the vital floodplains on which we rely each year to keep the River Severn out of homes and businesses. I was pleased to hear in a recent meeting with the Environment Agency that it rates Worcester City Council as one of the best councils in the area at using the planning system to protect its floodplains. Given that we see winter floods almost every year, that is essential. For as long as anyone can remember, Worcester has been bombarded by Labour leaflets telling people that Labour is the party of affordable housing. I remember fighting local election campaigns as long ago as 2001 in which every Labour leaflet was adorned with messages about affordable housing. In 2003, the Liberal Democrats went into coalition with Labour on the council, with the explicit aim of delivering more affordable houses. If Labour had any track record of success in this area, the leaflets would be understandable. Knowing the importance of affordable housing, I made it my mission to explore how much Labour administrations in the city had delivered. The figures from Worcester City Council tell a stark story of Labour neglect. From 1997 to 2000, a period in which Worcester had a Labour MP, a Labour-led council and-oh joy of joys-that things-can-only-get-better Labour Government in Westminster, the council built fewer than 20 affordable homes per year. Very few of these homes, and none after 1997-98, were for affordable ownership, and the abysmal record of Labour when they had complete political control of Worcester was of just 22, then 11, then 19 affordable homes delivered-these figures in a city of 100,000 people. Unsurprisingly, Labour was turfed out of control of Worcester in 2000 and a Conservative administration took control. What happened to affordable housing delivery when those nasty Tories took over? It rose 47% in the first year, more than doubled in the second year and then ran all the way from 2002 to 2012 at an average of 112 homes per year-five times as many as Labour had delivered. â€œAh, yes,â€ said the Labour party, â€œbut things slowed down after we lost power in 2010,â€ and yes, they did. Labour left us with the lowest rate of house building since the 1920s. It took years for the housing market to recover from the great recession that began in 2008, but in Worcester we kept on building affordable homes. In 2012-13 the council delivered a remarkable 117 units of affordable housing, 79% of all new homes delivered in the city that year, under a Conservative administration.",70534,[],Housing,0,124,housing,583

Worse still, the fall in delivery of housing meant a slowdown in receipts from the new homes bonus, a welcome financial incentive introduced by the coalition Government to support delivery of affordable housing. Not only did Labour's chaotic year in control mean a more acute housing shortage, but it also meant damage to the city's capital receipts. Fortunately, the voters of Worcester, seeing the record of both Labour and the Liberal Democrats-who, alas, are absent from this debate-elected more Conservative councillors in 2014, and those mean old Tories took back control of the council once again. The result: an immediate recovery in the number of new affordable homes. The delivery of affordable homes in Worcester in the last year is the highest on record since 1997, and out of 460 new homes delivered in the city, 260 are rated as affordable. In 2015, new homes bonus income for the city rose to Â£5 million. The lesson here is stark: Labour always promise affordable homes, but only the Conservatives actually deliver them. I know very well that there is still a great deal more demand, and the city's own estimates suggest that this year's record delivery is only the baseline for what is needed. In debates on building affordable homes it is often as if the only choice is to deliver them and concrete over our green fields or to give up on providing them altogether. That is simply not true. In fact, whereas a fifth of homes delivered in Labour's one year of control were delivered on greenfield sites around Worcester, that figure has fallen, even as delivery of homes has increased, to only around 7.5% in the current year. Looking ahead, about 90% of the homes planned for in Worcester's land supply can be delivered on brownfield sites, and I hope that figure continues to increase. There is much the Government can do to further support the delivery of affordable homes in brownfield sites, and I am pleased to hear about the new brownfield fund. I hope the Government will look into more mechanisms to support renting above the shop and city centre living, which I believe can both help our high streets and address the desperate need for affordable homes. I welcome the Government policies on Help to Buy. I have seen that for myself on the streets of Worcester, meeting people who have been able to buy their own home for the first time who would not otherwise have been able to do so. I particularly welcome the Help to Buy ISA. I also welcome the Government's efforts to crack down on rogue landlords, going further than Labour ever did in their 13 years in office to deal with this very serious issue. Today's motion is typical of the relentless negativity we see from today's Labour party. It says nothing about the aspiration of working families to live in homes they can own, nor the steps that have been taken, greater than under 13 years of Labour, to regulate rogue landlords. I am very proud that in Worcester, under a Conservative Government and with a Conservative council, we are delivering more affordable homes than ever.",70534,[],Housing,0,126,housing,589

2015-12-15,Housing,457,Helen Hayes,Lab,False,"I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate on housing; it is the single biggest area of concern to my constituents. Whatever measure we take, this Government have failed to deliver the homes we need in the areas where they are needed and at the pace which is required to address a housing crisis unprecedented since the second world war. If their own measure of success is home ownership, the Government have presided over a decline in the number of homeowners of 205,000 since 2010. If their measure of success is the housing benefit bill, the current Chancellor has seen an increase of Â£4.3 million in that bill over the past five years, including a doubling of the number of in-work households in receipt of housing benefit. If the measure of success is, as it should be, the level of homelessness, there has been an increase of more than 50% in the number of people sleeping rough since 2010, and an increase in homelessness as a whole of more than a third. If the measure of success is the delivery of affordable homes, we see perhaps the Government's most catastrophic failure: a decline of almost 75% in the delivery of new homes at genuinely affordable social rents since 2010, and a new definition of affordable rents, which makes a mockery of the term â€œaffordableâ€. In response to that failure, the Government appear to be constructing a new set of policies around an entirely arbitrary dividing line. Let us call it the aspiration threshold. Above that line, which quantifies at a house price of Â£450,000 in London, or an income of Â£90,000 with savings of close to Â£100,000, the Government recognise the aspiration of us all to have a stable home for the long term, to put down roots in our community, and to know that our children can attend the same schools for as long as they need to do so. Below that line, the Government do not recognise the legitimacy of people's aspirations. They seem to believe that the most that council tenants deserve is five years' stability at a time. In the private rented sector, it is viewed as entirely acceptable to live with the threat of a no-fault section 21 eviction. For those people, moving their children out of a school where they are settled and away from their friends in search of an affordable home is perceived as an acceptable way to live. For those people who are paying rent so high that they cannot afford to save for a home of their own, the aspiration of home ownership becomes increasingly hard to realise. I do not understand why the Government are so focused on that arbitrary line. Most people in my constituency want the same thing: an affordable place of their own that is secure, safe, warm and suited to their needs. Most people do not want their aspirations to be achieved at the expense of others. Housing association tenants who would like to buy a home of their own do not want that to be at the expense of a family with two children in a one-bedroom home, whose aspiration to move to a council home big enough for their needs will not be realised if the Government force the council to sell off its larger family homes because they are the homes of highest value. We need to build more homes across all tenures, not one type of home at the expense of another. The Minister for Housing and Planning came to the Communities and Local Government Committee this morning, and could not give any assurances that the numbers underpinning his proposed radical reform of housing policy add up. Next month, hon. Members will be asked to vote on a set of ideologically driven, uncosted and unproven proposals in the Housing and Planning Bill, which is a pitifully poor response to the biggest housing crisis that this country has faced since the second world war. The Government have a shameful record and are making an inadequate response. I hope that they will listen and introduce a more convincing plan to tackle the crisis.",70534,[],Housing,0,128,housing,693
2015-12-15,Housing,458,Jake Berry,Con,False,"I direct hon. Members to my entry in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak in today's debate. I agreed with much of what the hon. Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck) said about housing being largely about security. We must accept in this country that the British housing journey has changed. The private rented sector is now larger than the social housing sector and 11 million people live in privately rented homes. To give Members an idea of the growth in that sector, it increased by 69% between 1993 and 2013. More than 1 million families with children live in the private rented sector. I hope that the Minister will turn his attention to those families today. In the mid-1980s, the age of a first-time buyer was about 25. It is now over 30 and, in some parts of London, over 40. The Housing Act 1988 introduced the assured shorthold tenancy for people who rent on a short- term basis while saving for a deposit to buy a home. It was specifically designed-I went back to Hansard and had a look-for students, professionals and short-term renters. In an age when people are renting for longer and with families, I believe that the assured shorthold tenancy is no longer fit for purpose for people in the private rented sector with families. As the figures show, being in the private rented sector means that people move more often. People come to my advice surgery and say that they have struggled all year to save perhaps Â£100 a month towards a deposit to buy a house, only for those savings to be wiped out by the cost of moving, paying agency fees and a new deposit on a private rented home. That is borne out by Shelter's statistics, which state that 60% of those in the private rented sector have no money left at the end of the month, other than to pay the rent. Santander states that 49% of people in the private rented sector have given up saving for a deposit to buy their own home altogether. I welcome the Government's Help to Buy ISA, which is hugely encouraging and helps those in the private rented sector to save up a deposit. Will the Minister update the House on his progress with the family-friendly tenancy? I have sent several written questions to his Department, and I would be interested to know how many family-friendly tenancies have been taken up and what reassurance has been given to lenders. When I worked in the Downing Street policy unit on that policy, lenders were reticent to grant longer tenancies because of their nervousness about seeking possession if they went in as mortgagee in possession. If, as I suspect, the number of family-friendly tenancies taken up is low, is it time for the Government to consider legislating in that area? Given that so many houses in the private rented sector now have their rent paid by housing benefit, it is surely not unreasonable for the Government, who are paying the rent, to ask landlords to offer more security to their tenants. Finally, let me cover something different. As we approach Christmas we will all be thinking of homelessness, and I want to mention Joanne Atkin and Michelle Brindle in my constituency, who saw Carlos Maradona, a salesman of The Big Issue who works outside Sainsbury's in Darwen. As well as coming to see me, they set up a crowdfunding page, so that everyone in the town could get behind Carlos at Christmas and help him to find a home. I will tweet the link after this debate, but I thought the House might be interested to know that we have already raised Â£1,400.",70534,[],Housing,0,129,housing,628

2015-12-15,Housing,460,Karin Smyth,Lab,False,"I want to focus on supply and demand in Bristol, where the situation for buyers, and especially renters, is challenging. Information I have seen shows that property prices in Bristol have risen by between 7% and 9.7% in the past 12 months. Hometrack shows that of the 20 cities it monitors, only London, Cambridge and Oxford recorded a greater percentage increase than Bristol, and the influx of property investors from London and overseas is now a further influence on the Bristol housing sales market. One constituent who phoned my office told me that he was turned down for viewing a property because the estate agent had a queue of interested cash buyers. The pressure felt by would-be buyers will increase further with the electrification of the London to Bristol line that will reduce travel times by 15 minutes, and effectively put Bristol on the same commuter belt as Oxford. Looking ahead, Halifax estimates that national house prices will rise on average by between 4% and 6%, and in high-demand areas such as Bristol that could be up to 10%. That is possibly good for investors, landlords and those who want to buy to let, but for young people and those looking to get on the housing ladder, it is not a good picture. Rents have been rising throughout 2015, and they are expected to rise in 2016. This month, a local estate agent in my constituency told our local newspaper:â€œIf I take our Bedminster branch, there are 15 or 20 enquiries a day for rental properties, and the supply is maybe four or five a week, so the numbers are chilling. I'm pretty sure that the stamp duty rise on second homes will have an effect. It will force people to think twice and it will take a pretty robust person to buy a property to rent out. It is a bad thing for the Government to do because there is a massive shortage of properties to rent in the Bristol area and it will exacerbate the problem.â€Other factors that make the situation even bleaker include average prices of Â£210,000 and salaries of Â£22,000-I dispute the assertion by the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson) about houses being affordable above a line from the Severn to the Wash. Some 10,000 people in Bristol are waiting for social housing, and thousands of properties are standing empty. Some councils in the south-west are doing good work. A local council in Plymouth has plans for homes, plans for social rent, a plan for empty homes, a charter for private rented housing and a plan for social rented housing. That is a Labour-run council-a small blot of red in the blue that is the south-west of England. Bristol and other local authorities need to learn from each other and share good practice. Also, the Government need to support local authorities that are trying to achieve something. The Government need not only ambition but a better plan.",70534,[],Housing,0,131,housing,492
2015-12-15,Housing,461,James Cartlidge,Con,False,"I should like to begin by declaring my interest. I am a controlling director in a mortgage broker and property portal dedicated to shared ownership, and chairman of the all-party group on housing and planning. When we talk about housing at the moment, there is obviously a focus on new build and on supply, but as I said in my intervention on the Minister, I still think that one of this Government's most radical changes is the one we are making to buy to let. In the last Labour Opposition day debate on housing, in June, I spoke on buy to let and said that I was looking for three changes from the Government, relating to the rate of stamp duty, to tax relief and to mortgages. Two of those changes have been delivered, including a measure on stamp duty. I said that it was completely unfair that a first-time buyer should pay the same rate of stamp duty as someone buying their 25th portfolio buy-to-let property or a second home as a holiday home. The Chancellor has had the courage to make that change, which no Labour Chancellor ever made. On tax relief, I said that it was wrong that first-time buyers or other home owners, who no longer have mortgage interest relief at source-MIRAS-should not have tax relief when buy-to-let landlords do so. Again, we are addressing that. Of course the buy-to-let change is controversial, and we are now experiencing a backlash from The Daily Telegraph and others against it. In the one minute and 44 seconds remaining, I want to remind hon. Members why it is necessary. The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee's minutes show that the rate of credit loss on buy-to-let mortgages in the UK has been about twice that for residential mortgages, despite the fact that 75% of buy-to-let lending remains interest only. In the past year, there has been Â£28.5 billion of lending with no repayment of the debt. For me, any area of the economy that requires tax breaks and non-repayment of debt to survive is unsustainable. The buy-to-let sector has not been sustainable. That does not mean that we have something against those who wish to buy a property to let. I accept that some people use such properties as their pension, and some are saying, â€œIt's my pension. Why are the Government hitting me?â€ One change that must come out of this proposal is that we have to talk, as a country, about the fundamental issue of pension reform. If we can do that, it will represent an important gain. Luke Johnson has written in The Sunday Times:â€œWe cannot prosper as a nation of buy-to-let landlords; we must also produce goods and services and export to pay our way in the world.â€That means investment-not just foreign investment but our own investment-as well as a higher savings ratio and a more sustainable economy. I believe that a key part of that will be a more sustainable housing market in which first-time buyers have a reasonable chance of buying the properties which, at the moment, are being taken from them by people who will then rent them out to those same people who want to be first-time buyers. This is a fair move and it is being brought in by this radical Conservative Government.",70534,[],Housing,0,132,housing,553
2015-12-15,Housing,462,Richard Burgon,Lab,False,"In the brief time available, I want to highlight the problem in Leeds, to illustrate the fact that it is indeed a nationwide problem and not one that affects only London and the south-east. In Leeds, buying a home is increasingly unaffordable, and that includes starter homes. According to the National Housing Federation's paper, â€œHome Truths 2014/15: Yorkshire and Humberâ€, the current average house price in Leeds is Â£179,000, which is seven to eight times higher than median earnings in the city, depending on whose figures are used. That makes a mortgage unobtainable for vast swathes of the population. Projections from the Office for National Statistics and the House of Commons Library have suggested that by 2020, starter homes could cost around Â£162,000 in Leeds. If that turned out to be the case, that would be significantly below the cap. However, the average income needed for such a property would be Â£45,000, and the reality is that gross median income in Leeds is currently around Â£22,000. Unless median income doubles in the next five years, starter homes will remain unaffordable. Richard Lewis, Leeds City Council's executive member for regeneration, has said that the council's ambitions for a new generation of housing are at risk because ofâ€œcentral government's focus on starter homes above all other types of housing and their attempts to reduce housing mix through extending right to buy and forcing the sale of council homesâ€. The right to buy sell-off of council homes is resulting in local authority housing stock being diminished, with very little replacement. Over the past three years, 1,159 Leeds local authority properties have been sold, with only 59 replacement starts-a ratio of 20:1. Renting is increasingly unaffordable for a wide variety of groups. The Leeds Tenants Federation states that, even in council and housing association properties, some people are spending between 40% and 70% on rent. Many in Leeds are also struggling with private rent. Indeed, the council has previously written to the Communities and Local Government Committee to say of the private rental sector thatâ€œrents are now taking a greater proportion of incomeâ€. It said:â€œThere is an increasing issue of affordability across all sectors of the private rental market.â€So there is much to do. The Conservatives spent the last Parliament blaming Labour, but that will not wash any more. They have their own record now, and on housing, both in Leeds and across the country, it is five years of failure on every front, with unaffordable home ownership, rising rents, deep cuts in investment and the lowest level of house building since the 1920s. There is a lot of work to be done. The blame game has to end, and the work must start and then be finished.",70534,[],Housing,0,133,housing,454
2015-12-15,Housing,463,Kevin Hollinrake,Con,False,"It is as true today as it was 30 years ago that more than 80% of people aspire to buy their own home. On the other side of the equation, house builders make their living by providing as many homes as possible. There is no lack of will to build, or a lack of desire to buy. The problems are due to the supply-side issues in the marketplace. Supply is constrained by a planning process that is not fit for purpose. There is a shortage of viable land, as much of it is locked away in public sector land banks, and a major demand side issue, in that house prices are simply out of reach for far too many people. Fundamentally, the supply-side issue is the one that we most need to resolve. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication: build more homes and most of the problems of affordability will fall away. We are building more homes. There has been a 56% rise in housing starts since 2010, and the number is now running at 136,000 a year. Planning consents are at a post-recession high of 240,000 a year, which will inevitably lead to more homes being built. I welcome the provisions of the Housing and Planning Bill and its objective to increase further house building and home ownership. I welcome, too, the brownfield register, permission in principle, the simplicity of starter homes with a 20% discount, and right to buy. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Alan Brown) may be interested to know that we took evidence from Dr Mary Taylor, the chief executive of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. She was asked whether, if there had been a one-to-one policy for right to buy, she would have got behind that policy. She said that she might well have had a different view. One third of all people in relative poverty are there due to housing costs alone. The additional homes created by right to buy, and funded by making greater use of taxpayer-owned assets held by local authorities, will deliver affordable homes to buy, for shared ownership, and to rent. I share the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry) that we need longer, family-friendly tenancies and client money protection schemes for letting agents. Earlier, I mentioned the huge swathes of land held in the public sector. The Government have pledged to bring forward enough public sector land to build 150,000 homes over the next five years. I am concerned that this land will be released and that we may need incentives to ensure that surplus, under-utilised land in our public sector is made available for development for our housing associations and the private sector.

2015-12-15,Housing,464,Jess Phillips,Lab,False,"Successive Governments have failed to build anywhere near enough houses. The Government's current Housing and Planning Bill at least tries to deal with some of that fallout. However, as with so many of their current policies, we are expecting those with the least resource to pay for our mistakes. The spare room subsidy was the first assault on the most vulnerable people to right that wrong. I worked with a young woman who, due to violent and persistent domestic abuse, needed to go into hospital to deal with her severe physical and mental health problems. For that period, her child was removed to foster care. When she returned home, she began the process of rebuilding her relations with her daughter. Her daughter remained in foster care to give them both space to recover. The period of time was such that she was considered to be under-occupying her property. She fast built up arrears and debts and was eventually evicted, leaving her with no stable home for her child to return to. That woman lost her home, her health and her daughter, and all she needed was a chance. Was it her fault that houses were not rebuilt when they were sold off? I do not think so, yet she paid the price. The bedroom tax was an instrument meant to encourage people to move out of properties that could be used for a bigger family, but it does not work like that if there is nowhere for them to go. It just makes money out of those who simply cannot bear it. The blunt-ended policy fails to recognise the realities of people's lives. Some of the proposed elements of the current Housing and Planning Bill will do exactly the same. The Government's intention to end lifetime and successive tenancies is meant, again, to encourage people to free-up much needed properties. That is all well and good, but similar to the problems faced by bedroom tax victims, life does not work like that. When an adult child has a choice to give up their own tenancy and livelihood to move in and care for an elderly mother or father, they have a very tough choice to make and will be unsure of their own future. When a victim of domestic violence is rehoused with her children, who have probably been through enough, will we say, â€œSorry gang, you'll have to move schools pretty much every five yearsâ€? Will the Government fund all of the new housing officers that will be needed to ensure that the system works fairly? I wonder whether any of the Ministers have sat in their local housing queue recently. I have; it takes hours to be seen. I do not want to stand here and moan. I want the Government to do something and have some positive suggestions. If they are going to encourage people to move in and out of social housing more frequently, they need to invest heavily in temporary accommodation. Currently, there is no temporary accommodation. The taxpayer funds bed and breakfast accommodation for families to live in-where used condoms are stuffed into the walls and there are dirty beds-when there is nowhere for them to go. The Government must invest in that. They must also look at models such as the one we have in Birmingham, where we have a social lettings agency with an honest broker, two-year tenancies and help with deposits for tenants coming out of social housing. The Government should look at those suggestions before they rush into something that will show up in my surgeries in glorious technicolour.",70534,[],Housing,0,135,housing,599

Members' attention to my entry in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. Last Friday, I visited a new development in my constituency, Saxon Place in Penwortham. It is a mixture of family homes for rent and for sale under shared ownership. I mention that because I had the great pleasure of serving with many hon. Members on the Housing and Planning Bill Committee. There was a lot of talk about the affordability of starter homes and a lot of the conversation was very London-centric. My point is that, in many parts of the country including Lancashire, the starter and affordable homes really are affordable. On the average income in my constituency, a family could, under the shared ownership scheme, get a deposit of between Â£2,000 and Â£5,000 and have an equity stake in that house. I remind hon. Members that the world does not end at Watford Gap. We agree that most Britons aspire to home ownership, but we have had a problem in getting more houses built. We have a growing population and more and more people live on their own. We need to be flexible about what we build. I was particularly pleased with the measures on automatic planning permission for brownfield sites. I have experience of developing brownfield sites. In the past, remediation works were costly and difficult. The fact is that we are getting better at that and prices are coming down. The provisions will start us on the way to building more homes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake) said, we just need to increase supply. It is not the whole answer, but we absolutely must build more homes. The important thing about the outline nature of that permission is that it gives reassurance to the developer that he can invest, but leaves the right amount of risk on the business rather than on the taxpayer. If we were to change the outline permission to make it more detailed, winding up in red tape, it would slow down the process, and there would be far too much onus on the taxpayer rather than on the developer. I also greatly welcome the Government's pledge to bring forward more public sector land to build more homes. The Bill is forward looking.

Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry), who are strong supporters of English votes for English laws and who question why Scottish Members are speaking on a matter that should be fully devolved to the Scottish Parliament. I point out that Scotland is specifically mentioned in the motion we are debating today. The fact is that housing is an area where the headline statement of devolution is seriously undermined by a haphazard split of responsibilities between this place and the devolved Administrations. As a result, many decisions taken in this place can have serious implications for the delivery of housing policy in Scotland, and for the real issues and concerns of so many people. The UK Government have stated that they want to transform generation rent into generation buy. It is certainly no bad thing to buy a home, but it must be financially sustainable, it must be right for one's circumstances and it must not be at the expense of future housing stock. The UK Government must focus on alternatives, too. We have heard concern from Members on both sides of the House about homelessness, which is a very real and very destructive issue. I gently point out that we should concern ourselves with this issue all year and not just at Christmas. The UK Parliament has lost its focus on the quality and quantity of housing. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Alan Brown) that this can be traced back to the Housing Act 1980, when the Thatcher Government introduced right to buy. The policy has been popular with beneficiaries, but it has had serious side-effects on the quality of housing in the social rented sector and in entrenching deprivations in the areas of social rented housing that have not been sold off. This Conservative Government are now going further than Mrs Thatcher. Owner-occupation is seen as the normal tenure for all households, regardless of income. This is exactly the approach that led to the American sub-prime scandal. Dame Kate Barker described the policy asâ€œpeople who are just on the cusp of being able to buyâ€being nudged over the edge. It did not end well. The Government's thinking is that the social rented sector is a temporary stop-gap, where tenants should not regard their residence as a permanent home. They seem keen to import the deeply damaging and socially divisive concept of welfare housing. These policies are a smash and grab raid by the Chancellor on the assets of the social rented sector. Forcing councils to sell their best assets strengthens the social segregation that scars too many parts of this country and the forced sale of housing association properties represents the abandonment of those forced to wait for years for a decent home. Even The Daily Telegraph described the policy asâ€œdumb, economically illiterate...morally wrong...and close to absurdâ€. The contrast between this shambles and the action being taken by the Scottish Government could not be starker. Instead of viewing housing as a weapon in a political game, the Scottish Government act on the basis that decent, accessible and affordable housing is central to the delivery of many other policy objectives. If we in Scotland had built houses at English rates since 2007, we would have 42,000 fewer homes. In fact, the Scottish Government have committed to something the UK Government no longer do: build both social and affordable housing.",70534,[],Housing,0,137,housing,582

In particular, I would like to draw attention to the number of housing starts across the country as a whole in the past year, which was 165,000, compared to the right hon.

I suggest to the Minister that the London Land Commission be given more powers to take hold of the surplus public sector land identified and make sure that organisations such as the NHS, Network Rail and Transport for London do not shilly-shally or delay.

Similarly, many developers would be happy to pay higher planning fees in exchange for guaranteed faster decision making, perhaps with the extra fees being refunded if the service level was not met.

2015-12-15,Housing,470,Rupa Huq,Lab,False,"In 1892, Mr Pooter, from â€œThe Diary of a Nobodyâ€, was the archetypal suburban London Mr Average, but on current figures he could not afford today to live where he did. In 2009, The Spectator said his home would be worth Â£1 million and that his clerk's salary would be Â£40,000. In Ealing, a typical suburb, the figures are astronomical and are placing an average suburb out of reach for the average Joe and Josephine, for whom suburbia was intended. Last year, average rents were Â£1,400. According to this year's Land Registry figures, a terraced house in W5 now costs Â£781,000. The Government's housing record is one of abject failure, on homelessness, homeownership, house building, rents and, crucially, supply. Shelter, an objective charity, says that channelling existing public resources to build homes that only those on high incomes can afford will result in 180,000 affordable and low-rent homes not being built or sold. That is as a result of the changes in the Housing and Planning Bill. The goalposts have been moved several times. In respect of rents, â€œaffordableâ€ can now mean up to 80% of market rents, which is just not realistic. These subsidised starter homes have been trumpeted, but they are a non-starter for people in my constituency. In Ealing, average earnings are about Â£34,500. If someone wanted a shot at just a one-bedroom starter home in W13, they would have to earn Â£73,142. In W4, it is even worse: Â£90,501. At first sight, the 1% rent reduction looks good, but it will have massive unintended consequences. I went recently to the reopening of the YMCA foyer in my constituency. It has sunk all its assets into it, based on a business plan of rising rents, and it now expects to be completely sunk. It was a massive oversight not to have exempted supported housing. There is so much I could say about the mandatory â€œpay to stayâ€ policy. The figure of Â£40,000 means two incomes of Â£20,000, which is not a princely sum in London. It is an attack on aspiration, which Conservatives keep talking about. Our capital city is being hollowed out, as we pay ever more for housing yet become ever more insecure at the same time. The Spectator says that Holloway is now becoming banker land. I fear that not just Mr Pooter but many others on average and modest incomes are being forced out of London, which is being left to bankers, oligarchs and off-plan buyers, whose playground our capital is becoming.",70534,[],Housing,0,141,housing,419
2015-12-15,Housing,471,Mike Wood,Con,False,"I welcome the Opposition's choice of motion, but I was disappointed by the shadow Secretary of State's lack of humility when he moved it, given his own underwhelming record in government. As the shadow Secretary of State correctly said, housing is a top-four issue. I am sure it is towards the top of most of our postbags. The challenges of housing, rent and affordability are among the major challenges we face, and they deserve better than the rehashed diatribe we heard at the start of the debate. What we are seeing from this Government is the largest land building programme in decades, which will help to address the fundamental problem behind both the availability and affordability of housing. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) correctly said, the elephant in the room is the issue of supply. Why is there this market failure that we do not see in other areas of the economy? Part of the answer is regulatory failure. The Government cannot control all the levers that affect supply, but it is right for them to do what they can to eradicate some of the barriers to that market entry. There are two elements at the core of addressing supply. The first is action to bring brownfield land back into productive use for housing. That is why I am so pleased that the Government are introducing this assumption of planning consent for developments on brownfield land. Devolution deals around the country are important, too. The devolution deal reached in my west midlands region is a combined authority with the powers of investment to bring brownfield land, and particularly contaminated brownfield land, back into use so that it can be made part of the land supply for our housing market. That is good for the environment-using brownfield instead of green spaces-good for housing and good for the economy. The second area that needs to be addressed to increase supply is preventing the planning system from becoming a bottleneck to the availability of housing. The Government's action to move away from the regional spatial strategy towards local plans as well as introducing planning in principle is absolutely vital and will hopefully mean that we have the supply to match this record house building programme.",70534,[],Housing,0,142,housing,378
2015-12-15,Housing,472,Andrew Slaughter,Lab,False,"Members who picked up the Metro this morning on the tube will have seen that Hammersmith features in this week's property page. They will have found out that the average price of property there is just over Â£1 million, although they managed to find a one-bedroom basement flat for Â£425,000, which would be just within the starter home bracket, requiring an income of only just over Â£100,000 to snaffle that up. The more typical development-the new development with no social housing given permission by the previous Conservative council-sees a two-bedroom flat in Fulham going for Â£1.2 million or a three-bedroom flat in the Queen's Wharf or Sovereign Court for Â£2.2 million. That is why owner-occupation has dropped from over 40% to just over 30%. Local people cannot afford to buy those; they are bought by foreign investors from United Arab Emirates, Malaysia or wherever, and are either left empty or rented out, which is why the private sector has gone up from 30% to 40%, but all properties are unaffordable. I am afraid that I have to include in that list of unaffordable properties the 85% of council right to buys, which are now rented out at market rates, and mainly to local authorities that are now paying three or four times what it would cost to live in council accommodation. We know what the Housing Minister thinks about this because he recently said thatâ€œif people want to live and work in and around London, it's actually making a judgment call about what you can affordâ€-in other words, â€œon yer bikeâ€. One type of housing is affordable-30% of the accommodation in my constituency is still social housing. Most Governments in the past, irrespective of party, would have regarded that as an asset, but not this Government. What are they doing? They are selling off housing association homes so that they in turn can be turned into buy to let at market rates, and they are selling 50% of the remaining 12,000 council stock in order to subsidise that sale. When voters voted to get rid of the Conservative council that was selling off empty council properties-it sold off 300 and was warehousing and emptying blocks of council flats and constructing zero social homes in new developments-they thought that they had got rid of all that. Now, however, we have a Government who are bringing it all back at the national level through the Housing and Planning Bill. There will be no social homes built in the future-nothing that is affordable to my constituents. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck) is sitting next to me. Her speech hit the nail on the head when it comes to the most disgusting thing this Government are doing-removing security from people who live in council homes and telling them that they will have temporary housing as a form of charity rather than a permanent home in which to bring up their families. The Government have reversed their position on â€œpay to stayâ€ for housing associations, which is welcome, but they should do the same for everyone. They should let families on modest incomes continue to live in secure homes in London and around the country, and end this appalling business of removing security of tenure from council tenants.",70534,[],Housing,0,143,housing,552
2015-12-15,Housing,473,Huw Merriman,Con,False,"We are simply not building enough to keep up with both the demand and the challenges that are faced by many of our constituents who want to buy homes of their own. Government initiatives are radical and welcome, but I would advocate further action, and I hope that the Government will consider some of the following proposals. First, there is a need to build on green spaces. Nearly 80% of my constituency is designated as â€œarea of outstanding natural beautyâ€. There is a shortage of land afforded for local employment, but where there is such land, it is on brownfield sites. If the tens of thousands of houses that my district councils intend to build are allocated to brownfield employment sites, where will our current and next generations of homeowners work? In one of my parishes, the village petitioned the district council to allow a small housing complex to be built on a green field just outside the building boundary. As a result of the campaign for building to be allowed on that green site, Etchingham now has a new school, a new village hall, and new affordable housing-all of it courtesy of that bold move. I should like the Government to make it easier to allow parish and town councils to make such decisions. When a district council has a plan, parishes and towns are required to conform to it; if they do not do so, their own local plans will not be approved by the district council. I should like to free parishes and towns from the shackles of district plan compliance. If they want to designate a site, then let them do so, and let them override district plans for their own purposes if that is within the planning laws. Secondly, there is a need to deliver more infrastructure. Although the argument that more housing is required is being won, there is a real fear that communities will not have schools, doctors and other essential public services until the housing has been completed. If authorities could deliver infrastructure at the same time as building began, the public might embrace the building of more housing, and might even ask for more housing than had been scoped if, say, a new secondary school would be built with a few hundred more houses. I should like local authorities to be given the power to borrow money against the receipts from new homes bonuses, although, of course, that would work only if the new homes bonus scheme were extended for as long as the plans. Thirdly, consent needs to be turned into new homes. The amount of land where planning consent has been granted but work has not begun continues to cause concern. The lack of building not only adds to the problem of a shortage of housing numbers, but also deprives local authorities of the ability to collect receipts from section funding or community infrastructure levies. I would support a policy that required developers to pay a first instalment of section 106 moneys within 12 months of the granting of planning consent, rather than on the completion of developments. Such a policy would not only incentivise house building and increase stock, but would permit local authorities to deliver vital infrastructure in parallel with house building. The need to tackle our housing shortage is a huge priority. It is a national tragedy that more is not being done, but I support the Government on what is being done.",70534,[],Housing,0,144,housing,577

2015-12-15,Housing,475,Daniel Zeichner,Lab,False,"I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker. My city of Cambridge is in the grip of a housing crisis, and I have 110 seconds in which to speak. An email that I received from a constituent recently encapsulates the problem. She wrote:â€œI live, work and pay my council tax in Cambridge. Housing in Cambridge is almost as expensive as London these days. I was very excited to hear about the help to buy ISA-but Cambridge should have the same threshold as London of Â£450,000. Looking at rightmove right now, it is disheartening that there are only 4 properties that would meet our criteria of 3 bedrooms and the Government's criteria of maximum Â£250,000 within a 5 mile radius of Cambridge...How are we supposed to buy, afford and raise a family in Cambridge?â€There are only four of those properties-four! Perhaps the Minister will be able to answer my constituent's question, but I personally doubt it, because I do not think that the Government have a clue about the real problems that face young people in Britain today. If young people such as my constituent cannot afford to buy, they have to rent, and do we hear anything from the Government about helping renters? I do not think so. If they were really listening, they would know that when house prices become unaffordable in areas like mine, the nature of the private rented market changes. Young families who would once have bought are staying longer in the rented sector, but the legislation has not kept up; the Government have not kept up. Let me skip the points I was going to make about the attack on social housing and conclude by saying a little about the impact on business. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) visited my constituency recently and even he, experienced on these issues as he is, was shocked by the consistency of the message from employers. In every sector, be it the thriving life sciences and tech sector, research and our universities or major public sector employers such as the NHS, the message is clear: we cannot recruit and we cannot retain staff while housing remains so unaffordable. This is therefore not just about housing; it is about social justice and inter-generational justice. At the start of my speech I quoted the question from my constituent and I urge the Minister to answer it:â€œhow are we supposed to buy, afford and raise a family in Cambridge?â€",70534,[],Housing,0,146,housing,413
2015-12-15,Housing,476,Teresa Pearce,Lab,False,"In a wide-ranging debate, we have heard contributions from Members in all parts of the House, including the hon. Members for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond), for South Ribble (Seema Kennedy), for Croydon South (Chris Philp), for Dudley South (Mike Wood), for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake) and for East Renfrewshire (Kirsten Oswald); my hon. Friends the Member for Ealing Central and Acton (Dr Huq) and for Hammersmith (Andy Slaughter); the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Huw Merriman); and my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Daniel Zeichner). My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips) made a passionate speech about the human cost of the housing crisis, and my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland Central (Julie Elliott) also spoke with passion about the shortage of social housing. Most interestingly, the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) spoke of not only his well-known interest in self-build, but his less-known interest in the Deputy Speaker's shoes. Clearly, the housing crisis is one of the greatest challenges to face our country in recent times, and Members from across this Chamber know the impact that housing has on their constituents' lives. The hon. Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) spoke of his casework, which mirrors mine. My advice surgeries are full of people suffering as a result of the housing crisis, and my inbox and telephone line are jammed with their cases. Rent costs are rising, and there are poor standards in the private rented sector. We have ever-increasing homelessness across the country, both in terms of statutory homeless and rough sleeping. The Government are seemingly committed to seeing the end of the social housing sector as we know it. Fewer homes are being built than at any time since the 1920s and we have a generation of young people priced out of the property market. For five years, the Government have had the chance to tackle this housing crisis head on, but they failed. It has never been more important to tackle the housing crisis, because housing affects everything-it affects our whole lives. Insecure housing affects our whole society. It affects health, education and productivity. Without a secure roof over our heads, we face uncertainty, instability and doubt. Stable homes make stable communities, and without safe, stable and affordable housing we face pressure across our whole society and across our public services. It affects our schools and our children's education, with unsettled classes affected by churn and individual children falling behind as they move school again and again. It affects public health and our doctors, who struggle to co-ordinate health awareness campaigns as a result of instability in the housing sector, as residents constantly move between practices. It affects our communities, where many are unable to set down roots, commit to a local area, and join local organisations, sports teams and religious groups. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck). The Government claimed that they would build more affordable homes, but the â€œaffordable rentâ€ is not affordable to many people. House of Commons Library research shows that in London it would swallow up 84% of the earnings of a family on an average income and it requires a salary of up to Â£74,000. This does not just affect London; the contributions we heard from my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol South (Karin Smyth) and for Leeds East (Richard Burgon) showed us that this is a national crisis, not just a London one. Many of those who cannot afford to buy have to live in the private rented sector, where the Government have failed to increase security and improve standards, and have overseen rents reaching an all-time high. Once the private rented sector was mainly for students and young professionals, but now it is families and the vulnerable who live in the sector. That was spoken about with concern and compassion by the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry). Some 9 million people now rent privately. Almost half of those who rent are over 35. They want the same security and stability that they would have if they owned their home, but they face insecure assured shorthold tenancies, and a Government refusing to encourage long-term tenancies and to tackle rising up-front letting agent fees. While these people pay more, the Government are failing to act to improve standards in the sector. Although the majority of properties in the private rented sector are well maintained and of good quality, there are sadly too many landlords who let properties that are not fit for human habitation. Indeed, the Government's own statistics say that 16% of private rented sector dwellings are failing the minimum safety standard. When my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North introduced a private Member's Bill to make sure that homes were fit for human habitation, it was talked out by Conservative Members, who argued that it would put a huge burden on landlords.",70534,[],Housing,0,147,housing,825

I would like the Minister to respond to two questions. If home ownership is the only way forward, where are people who cannot get a mortgage meant to live? Can he confirm that starter homes will be for first-time buyers and will not be available to cash buyers? The Housing and Planning Bill will lead to a loss of affordable homes to rent and buy, but more than anything it is a missed opportunity to tackle the housing crisis head on, to provide greater security, stability and safety to tenants in the private rented sector, to offer a genuine hand-up to those who are trying to get on the property ladder and to build more social housing. We have seen a comprehensive spending review and an autumn statement that have failed to provide for a programme of affordable house building and have attacked many tenants on low incomes due to cuts in housing benefits.

Members, the House will appreciate a reminder of what has been achieved since 2010. Back then, the housing market was broken. We inherited a planning system that was dysfunctional, and levels of house building that were tumbling. The economy and public finances were on the brink of collapse. Enormous progress has been made since. Almost 900,000 new homes have been delivered in England since 2010. In the last Parliament the number of first-time buyers doubled, the number of new homes we built doubled and public support for new house building doubled, and since 2010 we have helped more than 270,000 households buy a home. We have provided more than 270,000 affordable homes for rent, with almost one third of those in London. We are the first Government since the 1980s to finish their term with a larger stock of affordable homes. A reformed planning system gives far greater weight to the views and needs of local communities, but in this Parliament we want to go much further. The Government's investment is being doubled to Â£20 billion in the next five years. It will support the largest housing programme by any Government since the 1970s. Our ambition is to deliver 1 million more homes and double the number of first-time buyers. My hon.

My hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk explained the importance of self-build and praised the measures in the Housing and Planning Bill to promote it. My hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon pointed out that council house building is now at its highest level for 23 years, knocking down the myth promoted by the Labour party. It was good to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester point out that the Conservatives in local government, not Labour, are providing affordable houses in Worcester. I was also pleased to hear his welcome for our crackdown on rogue landlords. My hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen stated the importance of first-time buyers and the Help to Buy ISA that the Government are introducing. My hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk mentioned the measures that the Chancellor is taking to make things fairer for first-time buyers. My hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton made a great point about the importance of the additional housing that will be provided by the right-to-buy receipts, and my hon. Friends the Members for South Ribble and for Dudley South made encouraging comments about planning in principle on brownfield sites and the difference that it will make in their constituencies. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon South mentioned the London Land Commission and the potential for public sector land to be brought forward for development. My hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle was a strong advocate of neighbourhood planning. That brings me to the points made by Opposition Members. I shall start where my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning left off. He mentioned â€œBack to the Futureâ€ to describe Labour's approach and he was right. Labour still has a past which it harks back to, but it has very little of a future to look forward to if today's debate is anything to go by. Speaking from the Front Bench, the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) and the hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Teresa Pearce) spent 40 minutes in total on their opening and winding-up speeches, and did not put forward one idea for tackling one of the biggest issues facing the country. It was all soundbites, empty rhetoric and ideology rather than pragmatism to help people get into their own home. For some reason Opposition Members seem very happy to own homes themselves, but when it comes to other people having the chance to own their home, they do not seem to want it. We want people to have the opportunity to own their home, which 86% of people want. There were eight speeches from Labour Back-Bench Members that were extremely consistent with those from their Front Bench. In those eight speeches not one idea was suggested to try to deal with the issues that the country faces. There was one notable exception. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips) made several constructive comments and proposed a number of ideas that we will look at in the context of the debate. Britain has come a long way over the past five years, a journey that has taken us from the brink of bankruptcy to being the fastest-growing advanced economy in the world. Confidence has returned and living standards are rising. More people are buying homes and house building is on the rise. But we must go further, and this Government are under no illusion about the scale of the progress that is required. In the past five years we have pulled house building up from the record lows of the previous decade, and in the next five years we intend to push it up further to levels not sustained since the 1980s. The challenges that we face today have been many decades in the making. Our focus moves us from rescue to reform. We must address the deep structural weaknesses in the way that this country plans and builds for the future. A better housing market will be vital for raising the productivity of our country and rebalancing the economy. Above all, it will ensure that Britain is a country of opportunity, where everyone who works hard can realise their dream of home ownership-the housing association tenant, the young family who want to settle down, and the retired couple who want to build their own house. They all voted for a better housing market and that is what this Government are determined to deliver.",70534,[],Housing,0,150,housing,1039
2019-03-28,Housing,710,Richard Bacon,Con,False,"I am sorry to see Members leaving the Chamber, because we are about to discuss the Government's top domestic priority, which is of far more concern to many people up and down the country than our endless talk of Brexit. I have entitled this debate â€œHousingâ€ because I did not want to be confined to any specific part of the housing debate and wanted to give the Minister the opportunity to address any question within the housing space. It is absolutely clear that we have a very big housing problem, and have had a very big problem, for some years. I have been attending seminars, roundtables and conferences on housing for at least seven years. I first went to the QEII Centre to hear Adri Duivesteijn, the godfather of the self-build and custom house building movement in the Netherlands-a former Dutch Member of Parliament who then became the mayor of Almere, a community in the Netherlands that I think I am right in saying the Minister has visited. Since then, I have been to many events of various kinds, and everyone has their own diagnosis of the problems and their own solutions, but generally they all mention land, planning or finance. They often mention the role of the volume house builders, the way in which local council planning authorities are stretched and the difficulty in getting access to land. Many of these points have a great deal of truth about them, but the issue can be encapsulated much more simply in the following sentence: the supply of housing does not rise to meet the demand for housing. In many other areas of life, it is true that supply generally does rise to meet demand. In what I would call orthodox, rather than classical, economics, if someone is making what economists call supernormal profits-profits that are in excess of what one might expect-two factors generally combine to bring those profits down to normal levels. One factor is that other actors in the marketplace will see the opportunity of those high profits and will move in. In other words, new suppliers will move in, with competition, increasing choice for consumers and driving down the profit margins. But that is not the situation that we have in the United Kingdom. In fact, over the last 30 years, the situation has steadily become the reverse of that. We effectively have permanent supernormal profits. Some 30 years ago, in 1988, 66% of houses in this country-a large fraction of the total-were built by SME builders, which were represented by excellent organisations such as the Federation of Master Builders. The situation now is that less than 20%-perhaps 15% or 17%-of houses are built by SME builders, with all kinds of extra problems that make it more difficult for them to engage. Now a very small number of very large companies build most of the houses; for the most part, they are the members of the Home Builders Federation. The strange thing is that if one asks consumers what they think and what they want, as has been done several times by independent, authoritative opinion pollster organisations that have been commissioned for the purpose, they will come up with the following result. Somewhere between two thirds and three quarters of people do not want to buy the products of volume house builders. The figure of 75% comes from a You Gov survey conducted by the National Custom and Self Build Association, which is a trade body for, as the name suggests, self-building and custom house building, whereby houses are manufactured offsite-perhaps a better way of putting it is â€œhigh-tech offsite constructionâ€-and then delivered to a site where they are constructed. The figure of 67%-the two thirds of people who do not want to, or would prefer not to, buy the product of the volume house builders-comes from the volume house builders themselves. Their own research tells us that most people do not want to buy their product. Now, in a vaguely competitive ecosystem where there was choice for consumers, that would be corrected by new suppliers coming in and providing something that consumers did want. Let me be very clear that the numbers themselves suggest that between a third and a quarter of consumers do want to buy the product of volume house builders. If they wish to do so, they should be free to do so, as long as those products are built to the right standards in terms of health and safety and building regulations. I have no issue with that at all. It is true that, over the last 30 to 40 years, houses have got smaller and more expensive than they were in the not-that-distant past. However, if people wish to buy the product of a volume house builder, they should certainly be free to do so, as long as those volume house builders operate within the law; I do not object to that at all. But fundamentally, the two things required for this ecosystem to function are low barriers to entry and consumer choice, and those are the two things that are fundamentally absent. We all know what the consequence is. I have tested this with nine-year-olds in primary schools in my constituency. I say, â€œWhat happens to the price of something if there is not enough of it?â€, and every had goes up and they say, â€œIt goes up.â€ Then, just to make the point really clearly, I say, â€œAnd what happens to the price of something if there is too much of it?â€, and every hand goes up and they say, â€œIt goes down.â€ It is not difficult to understand-it is intuitive to the point where a nine-year-old can grasp it. That is what has happened to the housing market, if one can call it a market, in the UK. I suppose that an economist might say that of course it is a market, but a very oligopolistic one-in other words, something approaching, but not quite, a monopoly. That means that the suppliers making supernormal profits can keep on doing this for a very long time without let or hindrance. At the same time, the average price of an average dwelling has gone from three and half to four times income a generation ago to about eight times income now. That depends on where one is in the country, of course. For South Norfolk, the last figures I saw from the National Housing Federation-admittedly slightly out of date now, but they will not have changed that much-were about 8.2 times average income. The same numbers suggested 8.2 times average income in Harlow in Essex, 13 times average income in Hertfordshire, and 17 times average income in Oxford-and in some of the really hot boroughs in London, it was completely off the charts. Even in the poorer parts of the country where incomes are lower and properties are less desirable, it is now five and half to six times average income in many cases. I pumped my parliamentary salary into one of the websites just to see what a lender would lend, and I was quite horrified that the first number that came out was five and half times income. That would not have been possible a generation ago. We have had more money chasing roughly the same amount of houses, and, not surprisingly, the price has gone up.

In the same light, I would not bang on about carbon, making people feel kind of morally inferior-I would explain that one could have the choice of having a house that would cost nothing to heat, and ask why anyone would want one that cost a lot to heat. I had this out very specifically at the Policy Exchange think-tank with the land use and planning director of Barratt. I asked about what it did for its customers in this regard. I said, â€œIs it really true that you have a conversation with your customers in which you say, â€˜Now madam, we've got a variety of houses available for you, this one over here that will cost you roughly Â£1,400 a year for heat and hot water, and this one over here that is insulated to, or nearly at, passive house standards that will cost you almost nothing to heat-perhaps, with mechanical ventilation with heat recovery, Â£80 or Â£150 a year.

I have heard the chief executives of volume house builders criticise Persimmon for its bad practice. We all know what happened to the sainted Jeff Fairburn. Because of his compensation scheme, he was being paid-I will say this slowly-Â£130 million in emoluments by the shareholders of Persimmon. So egregious a scandal was it that he got so sick of being followed round by someone from the BBC with a microphone asking him to justify it that he eventually resigned, which was a red letter day for many of us who are campaigning for higher quality.

Modern house building should ensure better air quality, better insulation, better heating, better windows and better doors. It is also about the location-for example, the green areas around the house and access to shops. A house has to be a home. I declare an interest, as chair of the all-party parliamentary group for healthy homes and buildings. I know that the Minister and the hon. Gentleman have read the APPG's report and are aware of its recommendations. Does he feel that those are a way forward for housing?",80790,[],Housing,0,6,housing,115
2019-03-28,Housing,716,Richard Bacon,Con,False,"I do, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of that. There is a lot of evidence that if people live in better, more spacious, healthier homes, there are lower costs for the NHS and lower sickness rates; it is better for employees and employers. There are lots of other ancillary benefits of having better homes, as well as their being good in themselves. I am keeping a close eye on the clock, Madam Deputy Speaker. I planned to start with a preamble, which I seem to be doing without too much trouble, and then get into the specifics of what I want to say to the Minister about the Right to Build Task Force, but I will say one or two more things before I do that. The situation we face is one in which an entire generation have basically given up on the chance of either owning a property or even being able to afford to rent one. In general, and especially in the big cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester, people spend an absurd proportion of their income on rent. When it is costing people over 50% of their net monthly salary to rent a ghastly little bedsit where the mattress is hanging over the sink-I do not exaggerate; I saw such an example on a Channel 4 documentary a while ago-we obviously have a big problem. I was at a dinner at the London School of Economics where a professor was talking about a graduate student of his who was about to start working in the Bank of England on a not inconsiderable salary, but he was going to be living at home with his mum. The chap from KPMG around the table said, â€œWell, that's nothing. We start our graduates on Â£45,000, and they can't afford to buy anywhere.â€ Then the chap from Black Rock said, â€œWell, that's nothing. We start our graduates on Â£75,000, and they can't afford to buy anywhere, certainly not within a decent distance of our office.â€ It has got completely out of sync, and the Government have to fix it. There is, of course, a political problem for our own party. I will address that later, but it is perfectly obvious that if people cannot get somewhere to live at a price they can afford, they will not vote for a party that cannot provide that for them. We need a fundamental change. We have dug ourselves a big hole over the last 20 to 25 years, and it will take us 20 to 25 years to dig ourselves out of it. If we are not careful, we will be in the same position in 20 to 25 years, only worse, unless we have the right policy proposals for fixing it. That is what I want to come to. When I came off the Public Accounts Committee in 2017, it was to spend time on the Right to Build Task Force, an initiative set up by the National Custom and Self Build Association to help local councils, developers, community groups and landowners who want to bring forward self-build and custom house building projects on serviced plots of land-that is to say, where all the difficult bits such as fresh water, sewage, electricity, broad- band and so on are already dealt with-in order to increase supply and give people more choice. That is what I have spent most of the last two years in this place doing.",80790,[],Housing,0,7,housing,580
2019-03-28,Housing,717,Alex Chalk,Con,False,"In Cheltenham, the overwhelming majority of the house building taking place in the town centre is for retirement apartments. Does my hon. Friend agree that if we want to maintain the culture, vitality and vibrancy, we have to ensure that young people can afford to live there as well? Will he join me in congratulating the Government on providing, through the home improvement fund, millions of pounds for a Portland Place development in Cheltenham that subsidises marginal viability schemes, to ensure that young people can truly live in the town centre and contribute to its vibrancy?",80790,[],Housing,0,8,housing,96
2019-03-28,Housing,718,Richard Bacon,Con,False,"Yes, I do, although I could easily get into a long discussion about viability that would consume the rest of this debate, which I cannot do. There are big problems with the whole concept of the way in which we calculate viability. However, I congratulate the Government on helping Cheltenham bring forward what sounds like a very important scheme. The Right to Build Task Force has been going for two years. We have scraped together Â£300,000, courtesy of the Nationwide building society's charitable foundation, the Nationwide Foundation. Over 50 organisations have been helped, of which 60% are local councils, with the rest being community groups, landowners and developers. There is a whole range of examples of its work. Aylesbury Woodlands in Buckinghamshire will have a project where 15% of all the new homes are custom and self-build. Cornwall has an ambition to bring forward up to 1,000 serviced plots across the county. I am looking around for my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Scott Mann), who arranged the meeting we had with the Prime Minister on this very subject and who is a passionate believer in more serviced plots. North Northamptonshire has a plan whereby as many as 10% of homes could be custom and self-built across several different local authorities. There are rural areas such as Eden in Cumbria, which is looking at a range of opportunities for affordable homes for local people. King's Lynn and North Norfolk, in my own county of Norfolk, has agreed an action plan to drive up delivery across the area with landowners and smaller builders. A lot is going on already, but the thing is that there could be very much more going on. This is the fundamental point. It is a quote from Andrew Baddeley-Chappell, a former director of Nationwide building society, who is now the chief executive of NaCSBA, while still chairing the Bank of England residential property forum. He has said:â€œCustom and Self-build can deliver more and better homes that more people aspire to live in and that communities are happier to see built.â€An exegesis of that would basically cover most of what I want to say. If we want more homes, we have to build them in a way that people want. At the moment, the problem is that most local people feel they have no say or voice in what gets built, where it gets built, what it looks like, how it performs-its thermal performance and therefore what it costs to run-and, absolutely crucially, who gets the chance to live there. If we change all that, we change the conversation. As the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn), the former shadow Secretary of State said, we need to turn NIMBYs into YIMBYs. Prince Charles put it even better when His Royal Highness referred to BIMBYs-beauty in my backyard. We need to create an environment in which people actually welcome housing. We have reached the tipping point now in that more people want it than do not, because people have begun to realise how serious the crisis is. As the Minister would expect, I have a small number of specific asks. The first is that we should have more Government support for the taskforce. We have already had some. I persuaded my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Sajid Javid), when he was the Housing Secretary, to lend us a civil servant-a qualified planner and career civil servant. He would prefer me not to mention his name, but I will because we are so indebted to him. His name is Mario Wolf, and he directs the work of the taskforce. We are very grateful for the loan of Mario Wolf from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. He has done an enormous amount with very little in the way of resources. I mentioned some of the work earlier. It is of course true that if we had more Government support, we could do more. The Help to Buy programme, which I will come on to in a moment, has so far spent Â£10.6 billion, and plans to have spent Â£22 billion by 2021. In other words, 35,000 times more is spent on subsidising demand than on a scheme to subsidise supply, albeit indirectly by helping to facilitate and increase choice for consumers-except, of course, that the Government are not actually paying for it; Nationwide building society is paying for it. I hope to have a discussion about that with the Minister at some point, because we are of course implementing Government policy. If hon. Members read the housing White Paper, they can see that we are implementing Government policy. If they read the Homes England strategy, it is very clear that the strategy calls for diversification of housing. The second thing I would like the Minister to consider is a review of the planning guidance on custom and self-build housing-the guidance that supports the revised national planning policy framework-because at the moment it is outdated. Three things need urgent attention. On land allocation, many councils do not even know if they are allowed to allocate land specifically for custom and self-build housing, even though they are, and councils such as Bristol City Council are already doing so. We also need clarity about what counts. Some local authorities are gaming the system, and in some cases local authorities are not clear what counts towards their legal obligations to provide permissioned plots of land. Some councils are allowing the conversion of holiday lets into private dwellings under the happy delusion that that counts towards meeting their legal obligations under the right to build legislation, and some of them may be in for a rude awakening at some point. There is also the issue of viability. For as long as one has viability assessments, the Government need to look carefully at how they should work in relation to custom and self-build; they will not necessarily be the same as for market housing. I would be grateful if the Minister engaged with the taskforce on updating the guidance generally, so that it is more fit for purpose. My third request is about the Planning Inspectorate. It is absolutely imperative that Government planning inspectors properly apply the current provisions of the legislation when they determine planning appeals and when they examine local plans. There is clear evidence that that is not happening as it should-mostly because planning inspectors are unfamiliar with the law in this area, which is still quite new. The obvious answer is to have training for inspectors. The Secretary of State has agreed with me at the Dispatch Box that we should do that, although it has not happened yet. I urge the Minister to pursue that and engage with the taskforce in identifying exactly what training is required. We need something to help raise consumer awareness. Most people would like to commission a project of their own at some point in their lives; 1 million people would like to do that in the next 12 months, yet only 12,000 to 15,000 do. The reason is that it is very difficult to get a serviced plot of land. If getting one were as easy as it is to go into a Ford dealership and buy a Ford Fiesta, far more people would do it. We are spending a significant amount of public money on housing, but at the moment I am not convinced that we are not simply making the problem worse. Help to Buy will have spent Â£22 billion by 2021 on helping 360,000 households. If we divide one figure by the other, we get Â£61,111-that is per household. We should be spending that better. At the moment, we are propping up an oligopoly that performs well financially for itself, with some horrible results, while making itself unpopular with consumers who cannot afford its products.",80790,[],Housing,0,9,housing,1312

If we get this right, we can engender a revolution in this country in how housing is done. If we get it wrong, we will pay a high price at the ballot box: almost nobody between the ages of 20 and 40 can easily, at a price a normal person can afford, dream of having their own place, even though 86% of people in this country want to.

Friend has not been to listen to many of my speeches, but what he said resonates strongly with me: many of the themes he laid out in his preamble and diagnosis I am myself going around the country promoting-not least the dysfunctionality of the house building market. The one element that he omitted, but that I am sure he is aware of, is that the situation is not helped by the fact that in the crash of 2007-08, 50% of all small house builders were wiped out-removed from the market-having produced, as my hon. Friend said, more than half of all new homes. That proportion has now dropped to about a third, I think.

He is right that we need to do something about the way in which the house building market functions at the moment, and my job is to wander around being disruptive, supporting new entrants and players to create the competitive landscape that he is looking for-competing on quality and type; being disruptive on technology and encouraging modern methods of construction, including off-site manufacture and new techniques, so that new entrants find it easier to overcome the barriers to entry that he mentioned; and being disruptive on finance. My hon. Friend is a little negative about Help to Buy, but I ask him to take care.

We continue to review the policy in the light of its success-some 160,000 people have now accessed homes who otherwise would not have done so. In the last minute or so I want to return to my hon. Friend's questions. He asked five specific questions. First, will we look at a review for the taskforce? Given that we are going into a spending round, with what may be small amounts of money in the scale of the spending that I have available, I would be more than happy to do so. I am of course also more than happy to look at planning guidance review and particularly land allocation. In particular, we could perhaps think about communicating more widely to local authorities. I would be happy to help him by sponsoring some kind of event to promote the idea and to help local authorities to learn. On viability, when I was on the Treasury Committee we did a housing inquiry in which I posed the question to Kate Barker and David Orr whether we should do away with the viability test as part of the planning system, and both of them thought that that was a good idea. In the meantime we have standardised the viability test to see where we get to. On the Planning Inspectorate, my hon. Friend is right. We are trying to talk to staff about how they can be more consistent in their decision making and apply it more regularly across the country. Finally I would be more than happy to join my hon.

2019-04-09,Housing,508,Kit Malthouse,Con,False,"Well, 12,500 is the minimum amount that is due to come out of the affordable homes programme. We hope and believe that the aspiration may be more, not least because we have taken the cap off the housing revenue account. It is therefore up to the ambition of councils whether they do this. As the Chairman of the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts), knows, I would love to sit in my office in Whitehall and plan the country-the Malthouse period of planning. I could plan in his constituency, as I could in mine, and decree what all these targets might be. However, as he knows, there are numerous housing markets in the UK -there are probably 30 or 40 in the capital alone-and they all operate in a different way, with lots of variable sites that all have their own issues and problems that need to be dealt with, so we are setting a standard target across the country as an aspiration. However, by setting councils free to build a new generation of social homes and investing enormous amounts of money in the affordable homes programme, which can also be for social homes, we hope and believe that that tenure will advance and increase to play its part in the 300,000 homes that are, we hope, coming in the years ahead. I am mindful that, with such a dramatic increase in supply, the more we build, the more important it is that we get it right. That is why we are focused on building better. A key part of that is communities having a bigger role in shaping the future of the places they call home. We are making changes to our planning system, and in particular the planning rule book, so that they can do this. We are providing greater clarity and certainty for developers and communities alike, by giving local areas more options and the freedom and flexibility to make effective use of the land they have.

We have seen that in parts of the country from Carlisle, to Exeter, to Oxfordshire, where forward-thinking civic leaders are able to think 10, 15 or 20 years ahead.

2019-04-09,Housing,513,Kit Malthouse,Con,False,"The hon. Gentleman raises a pertinent point. As I tour the country, I go to lots of places in all parts of the country with significant brownfield land. One of the cries I hear from people in meetings is, â€œWhere have all the bungalows gone?â€ That is a proxy for: where is the move-on space for older people whose children have left home and feel they need to downsize? We are keen to try to stimulate and encourage an, if you like, less than prime market that provides the kind of homes that older people would like to occupy. Key to that will be encouraging more participants in the house building market, as well as giving local authorities, as we have in the National Planning Policy Framework, the power to devise in their plans the type of housing that they need. It is perfectly possible for the hon. Gentleman's local authority to signal in its plan that that is the kind of housing it requires. We have also seen how community support increases when we build homes that grow a sense of place, rather than undermine it. It is why we are championing design and quality through the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission. We reinforced that in February when we hosted a second national design conference. It is increasingly important as we create new settlements across the country, such as garden communities. Last month, we announced support for a further five garden towns with the potential to deliver up to 65,000 homes, in addition to the 23 locally led garden communities we are already supporting. It is not just about getting numbers up, however. We are determined to put fairness back at the heart of the housing market. Our commitment to restore the dream of home ownership remains as strong as ever. That is why we have committed to a new Help to Buy scheme, which will run from April 2021 to 2023. We have cut stamp duty for first-time buyers and put a call out for evidence on innovation in shared ownership.

Local authorities should deliver more than would otherwise be delivered in their plan and can justify the need for infrastructure on that basis.

Having said that, the Government have taken steps, such as giving councils the power to charge premium council tax on empty homes and second homes, which should help with that issue. In the end, however, in areas such as the hon. Lady's, most of the problem will be solved by increasing supply. I recently attended a meeting with the Campaign to Protect Rural England down in her part of the world, where I tried to explain to 240 people who were not best pleased at the idea of having a significant number of homes in their area that this was their moral duty to the next generation and that they needed to accept the homes, control them, design them well, and make them fit in and enhance their local communities. We have a growing population and in popular areas where people want to live and from which young people are often driven out, the solution will be to build more homes. Happily, the picture is also improving for renters. We are cracking down on rogue landlords and from 1 June, the Tenant Fees Act 2019 will come into force, banning unfair letting fees and capping deposits. These vital steps will protect tenants and save them millions. We will also set out our position shortly on longer-term tenancies, because those in the private rented sector can face a high degree of insecurity. It is time that we put that right. Indeed, landlords could also benefit from more stability. As well as feeling more secure, nothing is more important than people being safe in their homes, so we will also be implementing a new regulatory framework for building safety.

When I reflect on what we can do better, I am clear that we must do everything possible to confront rough sleeping and the broader challenges of homelessness. Our cross-Government, Â£100 million rough sleeping strategy is helping our rough sleeping initiative reach more parts of the country-now more than 75% of local authorities in England. As part of that, we announced Â£46 million to support people off the streets and into accommodation in 2019-20, because we have already seen how that can work and make a real difference. Recent figures have shown the first fall in the number of people sleeping rough in eight years. However, we should make no mistake: one person sleeping rough is one person too many and we remain more determined than ever to end rough sleeping for good.

My triple challenge-more, better, faster-is the key to the country's happiness, health and prosperity and the work is starting to pay off.

It was the action that the Government took then that kept house building going and helped to pull the country out of the crisis. More than a decade on, under this Government, the level of house building has still not reached the pre-crisis peak. We have seen a pitiful performance over the past nine years. The public have lost patience with a Government who, nine years on, try to blame their Labour predecessors. The Government's record is now very clear. The rate of home ownership is lower, with almost 900,000 fewer under-45s owning a home now than in 2010. The level of homelessness is higher: the number of people sleeping rough on our streets has more than doubled since 2010. Private rents are higher, with the average tenant paying Â£1,900 more than in 2010. The rate of social house building is lower, and in the last two years it has been the lowest since the second world war. Let me say this to the Minister. If the Government had only continued to build homes for social rent at the same rate as Labour did in 2009, there would be 180,000 more of those homes-more than enough to house every family in temporary accommodation, every person sleeping rough on our streets, and every resident in every hostel for the homeless.

These are the fundamental facts. These are the hard truths about the Conservatives' record on housing, which Ministers cannot deny or disguise, and which, come the next election, the Conservative party will not be able to dodge. Given that record over nine years, it is little wonder that, when asked, three in four people say that they believe the country has a housing crisis. They are right, of course. Everybody knows someone who cannot get the home they need or desire. They say that the crisis is getting worse, not better, and they are right. Even many Conservatives have lost faith in the free market fundamentalism about housing, because it is failing on all fronts. That is why the Conservatives have been losing the argument and have been forced to cede ground to Labour, from legislating to outlaw letting fees, to banning combustible cladding on high-rise blocks and lifting the cap on council borrowing to build new homes. However, those are baby steps. The biggest roadblock to the radical changes needed to fix the housing crisis for millions of people is the Conservative party itself. It is largely the same ideologically inflexible Conservative culprits who are making the Prime Minister's life so difficult over Brexit who will not countenance the Government action that is needed to deal with the other big challenges our country faces: social care, falling real wages, deep regional divides and, of course, housing. So after nine years, we must conclude that the Conservatives in government cannot fix the housing crisis, and that it will fall to a Labour Government to do that. Here is the plan. We will build 1 million genuinely affordable homes over 10 years, the majority of which will be for social rent, with the biggest council house building programme in this country for nearly 40 years. We will reset grants for affordable housing to at least Â£4 billion a year. We will scrap the Conservatives' so-called affordable rent and establish a new Labour definition linked to local incomes and not to the market. We will stop the huge haemorrhage of social rented homes by halting the right to buy and ending the Government's forced conversions to affordable rent. We will end rough sleeping within five years, with 8,000 new homes available to those with a history of rough sleeping and a Â£100 million programme for emergency winter accommodation to help to prevent people from dying on our streets. We will legislate so that renters have new rights: to indefinite tenancies; to new minimum standards; to controls on rents; and to tougher enforcement.

He knows that I am a champion of community-led housing, and I was delighted that the Government responded so positively to the campaigning of myself and colleagues for the establishment of the community housing fund. It was first announced in the 2016 Budget with a commitment to invest Â£300 million over five years, with the money coming from the proceeds of extra stamp duty on second home sales. Money was allocated to 148 local authorities, roughly in proportion to the number of second homes and affordability issues. I believe that the fund will transform the community-led housing sector. It is expected to deliver 10,000 homes by 2021. However, the fund ends with the end of the current spending period. With more than 3,500 homes now in the pipeline, it is essential that the fund is extended to the next spending review period so that those homes can be delivered. Because of the delay in the spending review, there will now be a significant period of uncertainty for groups. Money must be spent by March 2020, so few bids will come forward from this point on. The spending review will not conclude until the autumn statement, at the earliest, and there could be further delay and indecision following that. So groups, including those in Cornwall, face an invidious choice. Should they continue to work on their projects and hope that funding will come through, or should they wait and potentially stall and collapse? In the social housing Green Paper, the Government acknowledged that housing associations could deliver more if they were given more time. That is more true for this sector than for any other. To illustrate my point, the Cornwall Community Land Trust, a well-respected enabler of community-led housing, estimates that the discontinuance of the community housing fund could put up to 230 community-led homes in jeopardy. I am sure we all agree that we need to deliver more genuinely affordable homes for local people in beautiful coastal communities where there are very high house prices, such as those in Cornwall, where it is so attractive for people to buy second homes. We need those affordable homes to sustain communities for generations to come, so I urge the Minister, who I know wants to ensure that my constituents and people all over the country have high-quality homes to live in, to make an urgent statement about the continuity of the much-supported and much-needed community housing fund.",80930,[],Housing,0,51,housing,427

For many of my constituents, a social rented house is an aspiration, and they are perfectly happy to live in one. Indeed, my gran lived in social rented housing her entire life and never owned her home. The Tories' record on housing is one of their failed promises. The UK Government talk big but deliver very little, with flagship manifesto pledges disappearing almost as soon as they are made. House building in England has fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s, while evictions are at a record level, the lead cause of people becoming homeless is the end of a tenancy, and a mere one in five council homes is replaced when it is sold. Contrast that with Scotland, where we have ended the right to buy for social rented housing, securing social rented housing stock for the future. No longer do houses disappear from the social rented sector and reappear almost instantly in the private rented sector at inflated rents that people cannot afford to pay. We have secured that investment, which has meant a huge amount to many of my constituents and to people right across Scotland. In England in particular, hundreds of thousands of people are stuck on social housing waiting lists because new stock just is not being built and houses that are sold off are not replaced. All the while, homelessness is up by 50% and rough sleeping has risen for seven consecutive years. I note that the Minister said rough sleeping has fallen recently, but that is on the back of huge spikes.",80930,[],Housing,0,52,housing,368

2019-04-09,Housing,547,Alison Thewliss,SNP,False,"The Scottish Government's house building record has been excellent. We have a target to build 50,000 new homes during this term of the Scottish Parliament, and houses are being built right across the country. The hon. Gentleman will remember from our time together on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee how well the Scottish housing sector was spoken about by those who came to give evidence to us. The hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Luke Graham) should pay no attention to his colleague the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake), who, as he often does, has his own axe to grind on all this. It is widely recognised that the Scottish Government are leading on housing policy. Our legislation on secure tenancies and in other areas has given renters in the private rented sector huge security. Ensuring that everyone has a safe, warm and affordable home is central to the Scottish Government's vision of a fairer and more prosperous Scotland. People cannot get on in life if they do not have a secure tenancy, a warm home and a roof over their head. The SNP remains on track to deliver on our target of building 50,000 affordable homes during the lifetime of this Scottish Parliament, which is backed by more than Â£3 billion of investment in the sector. There were 18,750 new build homes completed across all sectors in the year ending September 2018, an increase of 4%, or 635 homes, on the previous year. The latest statistics show that the Scottish Government have delivered nearly 82,100 affordable homes since 2007, which is significant. The hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire chunters from a sedentary position, but things are not going nearly as well in England. We are building proportionately more homes, more quickly, and he would do well to listen to us about this. That is all in the face of the challenges of austerity. Housing associations tell me they are deeply concerned about the Government's social security policies. For example, the roll-out of universal credit has negatively affected both tenants and landlords due to the major increase in rent arrears. I hear that from housing associations in my constituency and across Scotland, and my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Drew Hendry) could tell the House how housing debt has soared astronomically and how the Government have not learned the lessons. A report this month from the Scottish Government shows that in East Lothian, for example, 72% of social housing tenants claiming universal credit are in arrears, compared with 30% of tenants overall-that is happening across England, too-and with a trebling of evictions for non-payment of rent over the year since universal credit was rolled out. Some 88% of local authorities expect an increase in homelessness as a result of welfare reform over the next two years, and 75% expect that the roll-out of universal credit will increase homelessness. We are doing what we can in Scotland, and we have introduced a full mitigation of the bedroom tax, which people in England still have to pay. Without that, 70,000 individuals would lose, on average, around Â£650 a year. We also provide additional funding for direct mitigation of welfare reforms, direct support for those on low incomes and advice and other services. Further, concerns remain on the UK Government's right-to-rent scheme. There is a lack of clarity on what will happen with the scheme, and the Scottish Housing Minister, Kevin Stewart, has been in touch in light of the recent High Court ruling. What is actually going to happen with the right to rent? We need to know for the security and safety of our tenants in Scotland. We are still waiting on the courts to see whether Serco's lock change policy in Glasgow of August 2018 is unlawful. The policy has led to huge distress among those in the city of Glasgow with insecure immigration status, and we need to know the answer so that those affected have some certainty. In Scotland, we are also taking a range of actions to bring empty homes back into use. There are many empty homes that could provide people with good housing and a secure future. Since 2010, the Scottish empty homes partnership has been instrumental in bringing more than 2,800 empty homes back into use, each and every one of them hugely valued both by communities that do not want empty homes and by those now living in them-the homes are no longer going to waste. Empty homes partnership funding is to double from Â£212,500 in 2018 to over Â£400,000 in 2021 to bring those empty homes back into productive use and to make homes for people who need them very much. We have also created an ending homelessness together fund of Â£50 million over the five years from 2018-19 to support the prevention of homelessness and to drive sustainable change. Scotland has some of the world's strongest rights for homeless people, but we are not resting on our laurels. We are doing much more to tackle rough sleeping. We have a national objective to eradicate rough sleeping, and we have established a homelessness and rough sleeping action group chaired by Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Crisis. The group has developed 70 recommendations on the actions required to end rough sleeping and transform the use of temporary accommodation. The Scottish Government accepted those recommendations and are now taking them forward. Jon Sparkes has said he isâ€œvery pleased the Scottish Government has given in principle support to all of the recommendations on ending rough sleeping from the Homelessness & Rough Sleeping Action Group. The members of the action group have gone above and beyond to dedicate themselves to bringing forward the right recommendations that will have the biggest impact on the way people sleeping rough can access and receive services.â€In that light, we have been piloting Housing First. This is hugely important, and it will have a huge impact on reducing homelessness. The Under-Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mrs Wheeler), has been to Scotland to hear about what is happening, and she has noted that she is pleased with what Scotland is doing-she said so at Question Time, so I assume she still is. A recent documentary visited various cities, and the connectedness of services in Scotland-different services speaking to one another and taking action-was well commended, but we do not rest on our laurels. When there are still people sleeping on the streets of Glasgow, we must do more to ensure rough sleeping is ended, and ended soon. The Scottish Government's strong direction of travel is key. We need to prioritise that, but it takes a lot more than warm words and things said in statements and manifesto pledges to make that happen. Before coming here, I was reflecting on the number of housing developments in my constituency in the past few years. Off the top of my head, new houses have been built for social rent in the Gorbals, Pollokshields, Govanhill, the Toryglen transformational regeneration area, Oatlands, Calton, Bridgeton, Dalmarnock, the city centre, Anderston, Kinning Park and the Laurieston transformational regeneration area. None of them happened by accident. They happened because of the work of community-based housing associations, which strive to develop, build more and house their local communities. That comes on the back of the Scottish Government supporting them in everything they do and ending the right to buy to ensure that their investment is sound and can continue. The UK Government would do well to learn from what has happened on housing in Scotland, because our record is a good one.",80930,[],Housing,0,54,housing,1285
2019-04-09,Housing,548,Priti Patel,Con,False,"The residents of the Witham constituency are concerned about a wide range of housing matters. Ministers might be familiar with some of them, but I want to pick on three examples. First, the issue of how the five-year land supply is calculated affects communities across the country. In planning applications and appeals, we see developers trying to pick apart the declared pipelines in councils' local plans. To be frank, highly paid consultants and advisers are producing lengthy reports for applications and appeals, and the public struggle to contest them because they do not have the resources. I have seen many cases in my constituency of developers trying to pick apart the council's supply pipeline and go against local community planning and the council's planning objectives. That is not good enough. We all recognise that the delivery of land and housing can sometimes be beyond councils' framework and mandate. I urge the Government to look again at how much weight is applied to the five-year supply. We must ensure that councils and communities have more protection. Developers think that by ripping apart five-year supply calculations, they can develop almost anywhere. That is a major issue across the board.",80930,[],Housing,0,55,housing,197

2019-04-09,Housing,550,Priti Patel,Con,False,"I thank the Minister for that point. I will come on to that. Like all Members of Parliament, I want to see my communities empowered in planning decision making. In Witham town, there was recently an application for Gimsons-a site at River View in Witham-which is deemed a visually important site and is highly regarded by everyone in the community. The current local plan protects it from development. The draft local plan, which could be two years away from adoption, recommends approximately 40 dwellings, but an application for 78 came along and was granted permission. The residents were appalled that their views were ignored. I am a great believer in neighbourhood plans and I encourage all my parishes to develop them. We want much more support for community-based planning and neighbourhood plans, particularly with parish councils. I urge the Minister and his team to give more resource to parishes and communities so we can ensure that they are protected from developers, who sometimes come along wanting to rip up the five-year land supply and to challenge councils and communities. Importantly, we must ensure that there are resources and that place-shaping can happen. The Minister has already spoken about that. My final point is about the ways in which we can support housing and development. The Minister spoke about garden settlements. We have had many conversations and I urge him to ask the Secretary of State to reply to me-we have some outstanding correspondence. There is a huge opportunity for all Departments to work together to ensure we have integrated planning. That means that we have the right infrastructure, including road and rail, health, schools, and public amenities and services. That is a great programme that our Government could take forward. I urge the Minister and his colleagues across Government to work in an integrated way so we can drive the right kind of local community outcomes on housing and planning.",80930,[],Housing,0,57,housing,320
2019-04-09,Housing,551,Clive Betts,Lab,False,"I take the Minister back to my intervention about social housing. Let us go back to 2010. The biggest cut in expenditure that the coalition Government brought in was a 60% cut in social housing capital funding. If we are to build the 300,000 homes that I think both the Government and the Opposition are now committed to building, we shall not get them built unless at least 100,000 or more come from the public sector. Just look at the figures since the war. We have built 300,000 homes a year in this country, although quite a long time ago, but in no year when 300,000 homes were built were fewer than 100,000 built by councils and housing associations-and mostly by councils. That is the reality. The Minister says that the housing revenue account cap has been lifted. That is really welcome and I applaud the Government for that, but that of itself will not get the houses built. The Minister should not sit back and say, â€œI sit in my office and I cannot tell councils what to do.â€ It is not just about borrowing the money but about being able to fund the borrowing. The Government will have to look at more revenue support for councils and housing associations to get those numbers up. Of course, there will have to be developments such as modern methods of construction, which the Select Committee is examining at present but, in the end, revenue funding is crucial. I also say to the Minister, in terms of the HRA, the funding does not only go to build new homes; it is vital to make sure that existing homes are properly maintained. In 1997, when the Labour Government came in, there was a Â£19 billion backlog of disrepair in the social housing sector, which the decent homes programme had to deal with. So councils have that responsibility. They will need extra revenue support to build the homes. I shall make a couple of points about the private rented sector. There are now more people living in the private rented sector than in the social housing sector. Hopefully, we might reverse that in future by building more social housing. I say three things to the Minister. First, let us have some more tough powers to deal with bad landlords. The Select Committee recommended, in extremis, confiscating the properties of landlords who put the health and safety of tenants at risk. Let us go for that. Secondly, let us give councils more freedom: selective licensing can work. If councils want to do it in their area, they should be free to do so. The Minister reviewing the whole process of selective licensing--I hope that is where we get to--but, in the end, selective licensing works where councils can go into properties proactively and seek out the problems and the problem landlords, and deal with them. Thirdly, the difficulty for councils is that selective licensing needs resources. Since 2010, the funding for private sector housing teams in councils has been cut by 60%, and it is not possible to deal with bad landlords proactively, constructively and properly without more money. I say to the Minister, therefore, that there is a major financial challenge, both in terms of building social housing and of properly dealing with the problems in the private rented sector.",80930,[],Housing,0,58,housing,556
2019-04-09,Housing,552,Kevin Hollinrake,Con,False,"It is a pleasure to speak after my Select Committee Chair; we agree on much, although I am not sure about selective licensing, which is too often a licence to print money for some local authorities. It is also a pleasure to speak with the Housing Minister on the Treasury Bench. I feel, from my short time in Parliament, that he has got at least as good a handle on these issues as anyone I have seen. We need to build more truly affordable housing, both to rent and to buy. We cannot simply do what Labour would do-put more pressure on an overburdened taxpayer. We must do it in different ways. The best way to do it is to cut out the middlemen or middlewomen; I speak as a middleman who has been involved in the property market for 30 years. There are a couple of simple ways we could do that that are simply too good to miss. The Housing Minister is familiar with some of my ideas on this, particularly on delivering more affordable homes to purchase through the section 106 system. Every year, we deliver around 25,000 affordable homes through section 106 requirements. They are typically sold to housing associations at 50% of market value. The housing association then rents them out at 80% of market value and puts them on their balance sheet at 100% of market value; nice work if you can get it. Why, instead of doing that, do we not simply sell those properties-or half those properties-to first-time buyers on low incomes, at 50% of market value? That would be in perpetuity and those first-time buyers could pass the properties on to the next person. There is no cost to the taxpayer whatsoever. It is good for them. It is good for the developers, who are dealing direct with their customers. The only people who probably will not be too keen on it are the housing associations, but that is not who we are here for; we are here for real people.",80930,[],Housing,0,59,housing,340

To give a local example, in the town of Easingwold where I was born and brought up, 656 homes are being delivered, 279 homes affordable, all for renting, and only eight are two-bedroomed properties for young first-time buyers. That dynamic could be changed, and tens of thousands of homes delivered for first-time buyers on low incomes. The second way to cut out the middlemen is through the pension system. Currently, residential property cannot be put in a pension. If we change that rule, lots of empty or unconverted space above shops could be changed overnight. We should allow those properties to be put in a pension, as long as-this would be the catch, but it is a fair one-those properties were made available at a social rent. We would widen the pension system to allow people to buy property to put it into a pension, as long as they let it out at a social rent.

The homeless people I see on the streets of Birmingham often live in medieval conditions. I have met people in subways in their hospital gowns and people with rat bites fighting and fearing sepsis, and yet the homeless people in Britain's second city, in the sixth richest economy on earth, face a health system that is rated inadequate and a mental health service in which the caseload is rising four times faster than funding, and where only 1% of the money promised to the West Midlands combined authority for housing has actually been paid over to build new homes. That roll of names is a roll call of shame. I hope that in our city, if not elsewhere, we build a permanent memorial, so that we are confronted every day with the names of those who died, the names of those whom we have collectively failed.

One in seven homes in my borough is overcrowded, and housing conditions are the worst I have seen in 30 years, in particular in the private rented sector. That is why we needed the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018 of my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck), to call out those absolutely disgusting and appalling conditions in which families are living every day in my constituency. As for affordability, for the bottom quartile of homes-that is, the ones that should be most affordable-the average price is more than Â£500,000 in my constituency. Average monthly rent is over Â£2,000, and the ratio between house prices and earnings is over 20:1. And yet, because of the way in which the Government implement policies like the benefits cap, the reality is that people simply cannot afford to live in areas where they, their families and their communities have lived for decades. The only remedy is the sort of radical programme that my right hon. Friend the shadow Housing Secretary has set out. It is possible to make a difference locally. We do not have local elections in my area this year, but for those who do, I will just outline the difference between having a Labour council and a Conservative one. My council was Conservative until 2014. In its last four years, it sold off more than 300 empty council properties because they had become vacant. That included three and four-bedroomed houses, and many two-bedroomed houses and flats. These properties were sold off on the open market, putting them out of reach of families forever and a day. Cynically, that council then took a housing waiting list of over 8,000 families and reduced it to over 1,000, simply by knocking families off the list. In many cases, the council did not even have the courtesy to tell them. That degree of cynicism and that type of social engineering has gone on not just in my borough, but in many boroughs across London and elsewhere-and it is a moral crime, not just bad policy. I contrast that situation with the position of my council under Labour. This issue is one of the reasons that Labour was elected in Hammersmith and Fulham, and was then re-elected with a landslide last year. Labour-run Hammersmith and Fulham Council stated this month that itâ€œhas recently secured more than 1,600 genuinely affordable homes in the borough at zero cost to taxpayers after negotiating a series of deals with developers.â€That is the difference that Labour makes in local government, and I believe that in national Government-with this sort of programme of housebuilding, and the crackdown on poor landlords and poor conditions-we can actually tackle this crisis. It is not just that this Government are complacent; as my right hon.

That is nearly one in five homebuyers who are experiencing the injustices of the leasehold process. I have received 54 responses to a consultation that I launched on this matter, and there was an overwhelming sense of injustice and frustration with the leasehold process, in line with the findings of the Select Committee. Constituents made comments such as:â€œI feel stuck in a loopâ€, and said that they felt that they were â€œbeing held hostageâ€. Others said:â€œI'll have nothing to leave for my childrenâ€. One of the most common situations I have heard about is when homeowners wish to move home in order to downsize before retirement, but no company will offer a mortgage on the property because the lease is not long enough. Those people either have to find someone to buy the property cash in hand, or extend the lease. But extending the lease costs at least Â£10,000 and is frankly not an option for many of my constituents, who want to use that money to live on for the rest of their retirement. The Minister has stated many times that at least there is choice in the property market for those who may not wish to buy freehold, but the evidence collected by the Select Committee and the heartfelt responses I have received suggest that this so-called choice is anything but. It is not a choice if there is a lack of information about what leasehold means, and 36% of the responses to my survey indicated that people were unaware of what leasehold meant at the point of sale. It is not a choice when homebuyers are not told that the property is leasehold until the very day that they are signing for their new home, which is what three of my constituents told me had happened to them. It was also not a choice for 13 of my constituents who told me that, after saving up and wishing to buy the freehold, and paying numerous administrative fees-in the hundreds of pounds-the freeholder simply said that they were not willing to sell at that point. It is not a choice for those families. Another injustice is that of leases being sold by the freeholder to third-party companies, without any consultation, correspondence or notice given to the leaseholder. Where is the accountability? My constituents are telling me of their increased anxiety at the fact that their property does not â€œfeel like their ownâ€, and saying thatâ€œoutside people control their destinyâ€. Does the Minister agree that this is not a healthy situation for any family to go through? This is the home that people have worked for, saved for and are paying for.

The Labour Front-Bench team has committed to build 1 million affordable homes, and we should make sure that we build them in a way that does not harm our environment any more than it has already been harmed. Because of its affordability and its green footprint, I think the future should be modular. In my constituency, I have had the pleasure of watching modular social housing coming up just outside my office. They are some of the most energy-efficient homes in the country. Not only are they providing people with a beautiful place to live, but they are helping them save money. As I am sure the Minister is aware, Hull is the caravan building capital of the country. We have fantastic skills in my constituency, with an industrial base and knowledge that have developed over generations. I urge the Minister to look seriously at the businesses in Hull and to give them a secure funding stream and stability, so that these modular building companies have the capacity to develop and invest. These are uncertain times and there is uncertainty for business investment, but having a promise from the Government that they see modular homes as the way forward and are willing to invest in innovation would give those businesses the security they need.

2019-04-09,Housing,561,Helen Hayes,Lab,False,"The Minister spoke of the difficulty of quantifying Government targets for different types of housing. This is what can be quantified: the 1.25 million people on the waiting list for social housing, the 123,000 children living in temporary accommodation, and the fact that more than 99% of homes to rent in the private sector in Lambeth and Southwark have rent that is above the local housing allowance cap. This Government are failing, as the coalition did before them, by cutting the subsidy for new social housing, redefining affordable housing to make a mockery of the word â€œaffordableâ€, penalising residents with the bedroom tax, and lining the pockets of shoddy developers such as Persimmon and unscrupulous private sector landlords. The Government are also presiding over the disastrous relaxation of the rules on permitted development rights. In the time left available to me, it is this policy that I will focus on. The expansion of permitted development rights is delivering poor quality homes in former office buildings up and down the country, resulting in children playing in industrial estate car parks, poor fire safety standards, and homes that are not homes but essentially hotels by the back door that are let out through Airbnb and other platforms for short-term lets. Most shockingly, having introduced this major planning reform, the Government have undertaken no evaluation of its impact and propose further expansions that would enable developers to demolish and rebuild office buildings without planning permission. This policy is removing quality control and democratic accountability from housing delivery. Councils and communities have no say, and the developers who profit from these developments make no contribution to local community needs or the delivery of genuinely affordable housing. In many areas, the expansion of permitted development rights is delivering the slums of tomorrow and the fire safety horrors of tomorrow. This is happening on the Minister's watch. I therefore urge the Minister to do one small practical thing: to halt the expansion of permitted development rights while a full evaluation of its impact is undertaken, and to restore housing delivery to the full democratic control of local authority planning departments, which can decide where their communities need new housing, say where it should be built, and secure affordable housing contributions and funding for community facilities, so that we build not the slums of tomorrow but the high-quality, sustainable, affordable communities that this country so desperately needs.",80930,[],Housing,0,68,housing,400

If I was to use the issues that constituents come to see me about in my surgery as a guide to what else we should be talking about, housing would come at the top of the list every time. From the parent facing eviction from their private tenancy with no permanent housing options on the table, to the tenant coming back to me for the fifth time because the damp still has not been fixed, to the young couple whose kids have to share a box room totally unsuitable for them, it is very clear that we do not have enough housing at the right prices or of the right tenure. On a positive note, my local council, Chester West and Cheshire Council, is now building council housing, the first for nearly 40 years. I am delighted about that, but we still have less council housing than we had a couple of years ago, due to a huge increase in right-to-buy applications. Who can blame people for wanting to take advantage of 70% discounts? The policy, however, is short-term in the extreme. It is, of course, the Government's stated aim that every council property sold under the right to buy should be replaced, but the reality is that, rather than one-for-one replacements, it is more like one new property for every four sold. The situation is clearly unsustainable. There needs to be a wholesale change in the culture of and approach taken by developers. There seems to be general agreement across the political spectrum that we need to build more homes, but those good intentions are at risk of failing because there is an over-reliance on the market to deliver those aims. To date, the private sector has shown itself incapable of working in a way that chimes with the needs of the country. To put it mildly, I remain to be persuaded about the altruism of the house building industry; one need only look at the Â£100 million Persimmon bonus to see where its priorities lie. Plc house builders that help themselves to more than Â£8 billion of taxpayers' money through the Help to Buy scheme show their true colours when they rip off their own customers through â€œfleeceholdâ€. They have a lot to answer for. The reliance on a small group of developers has been a very poor deal for the taxpayer, and that is the backdrop against which the leasehold scandal emerged. I look forward to the Government's response to the excellent report by the Select Committee on Housing, Communities and Local Government. I hope concrete action will be taken soon. Many in the industry have signed a pledge to move away from onerous leases, but to be frank I think that has happened only because there has been so much bad publicity against the people guilty of this wholesale scam over the years. The pledge also seems hollow to those of my constituents who have been notified in the past couple of weeks that their freehold has changed hands again, from one opaque company based in Guernsey to another opaque company based in Guernsey. The industry pledge intends to make the whole processâ€œcheaper, easier and more transparentâ€, but actions such as those in my constituency will make it more expensive, more difficult and less transparent for people to buy out their freehold. The only way these rapacious people will be brought to order is through changes to the law, and the sooner the Government get on to that, the better. The biggest developers in the country have not just ripped off millions of homeowners; they have ripped off all of us. We should not rely on them to solve the crisis we face. The housing market is broken and needs radical intervention, and it certainly needs a Labour Government.",80930,[],Housing,0,69,housing,645
2019-04-09,Housing,563,David Linden,SNP,False,"I was delighted to hear the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss). She spoke about the damage that right to buy caused in Scotland, so I will not focus on that in my short speech. Instead, I will focus on investment in new socially rented stock. After years of under-investment in social house building, work is now under way to deliver 50,000 affordable homes in Scotland by 2021. People around the east end can now see the tangible results of that investment-whether on Cranhill's Bellrock Street, Easterhouse's Auchinlea Road or Shettleston's Wellshot Road-because work is under way to invest in new housing, which will go some way towards meeting the demand we face. That 50,000 target, though, should only be a starting point. I have been very clear with the Housing Minister, Kevin Stewart, that we need to keep up our investment in new build social housing. I was encouraged to hear him say at a recent Tollcross Housing Association event that, for so long as associations can keep up the house building, he will be happy to sign the cheques. The reality, however, is that we will quickly run out of space to build those new properties, which is why we must also protect and preserve our existing tenement stock housing. As the MP for Glasgow East, I am acutely aware that about one third of my housing stock is made of tenement properties. A quick drive along Tollcross Road, Baillieston Main Street or Westmuir Street will demonstrate that. The fact is that Glasgow's tenements have become a rich part of the city's architectural heritage, and my local housing associations genuinely understand the importance of maintaining them to meet the demands of their waiting lists. They want to invest in and preserve those buildings for generations to come, but that comes at great cost and there is a role for the British Government to assist with that. This morning I suggested to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that VAT could be reduced on tenement repair work. Currently, an association wishing to undertake costly works to preserve tenement properties will have a 20% VAT charge slapped on to the invoice. If the Chancellor was willing to look sympathetically at a reduction in VAT for that type of work, it would allow associations to invest in tenement stock and simultaneously provide a fiscal stimulus for the construction industry.",80930,[],Housing,0,70,housing,403

2019-04-09,Housing,565,David Linden,SNP,False,"Absolutely. I am conscious of the constraints on time, so I will just conclude by saying that Glasgow is a city bursting with ideas about how we can progress housing and meet the challenges head-on. I urge my hon. Friend to take that forward, and I urge the Minister, in summing up, to touch on the point about reducing VAT, particularly on tenement properties.",80930,[],Housing,0,72,housing,64
2019-04-09,Housing,566,Rachael Maskell,Lab,False,"On average, house prices are 10 times wages, and we know this skews our local economy but also drives the housing poverty that is so damaging to my city of York. The Lib Dem-Tory council has presided over this housing failure, with a fall in social housing when there is such desperate need, while at the same time developers have made their millions building luxury apartments that our city just does not need. City of York Council should be getting to grips with what is happening in housing, but it has failed, and I am glad the Government have rejected its local plan. Just last Monday, the council failed again when it signed off a 72 acre brownfield site for over 2,000 luxury apartments that our city does not need. I would juxtapose that with the 11 homeless people who lost their lives in our city last year, and with the people I see in my surgeries who are living in box bedrooms-whole families are in that situation-with adults and children sleeping on sofas. That is the reality of York, as so many people in housing poverty know. Not only that, but the council has handed over its influence over the future of that site, through a commercial agreement, while contributing Â£35 million to the site. This must be stopped and reviewed. Residents are rightly angry. They are being driven into deeper housing poverty, while the elite moves in on their space. They are being driven out of their city, and they are being ignored. While people invest in their assets and purchase their commuter and second homes, my local families are cooped up in unsuitable, cramped and damp housing. York, which calls itself a human rights city, is the most inequitable city outside London, and this latest development will simply make it worse. The Lib Dem-Tory council's plan just supports corporate greed over local need, and it must be changed. That will start with a Labour council, which will build the housing that our city desperately needs. It will put right the local economy by ensuring that we have the skills our city needs. We need 500 people in the NHS, and there are also those needed in the care workforce, but they cannot afford to live in our city. We will relive the dream that Joseph Rowntree planted in our city as he built the houses fit for heroes and the housing developments that set the agenda for the garden villages and sustainable green homes that will ensure people across our city can live in and enjoy our city. Labour will make the difference in York: it is time for change.",80930,[],Housing,0,73,housing,443
2019-04-09,Housing,567,Sarah Jones,Lab,False,"This has been a short but good debate-quality not quantity. We have heard from Members across the country from the hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton) to the hon. Member for Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss). To pick out a few, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts) spoke with great authority, as always, about the need for real revenue funding and for a substantial change in the private rented sector. The hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake) was absolutely right that we should look at locked-in discounts for first-time buyers. He will be pleased to hear that this is indeed a Labour policy, and if he votes Labour at the next election, his idea may well come to fruition. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy) talked about the need to tackle climate change through housing and how important the role of modular housing is. The Government are not just failing to address the housing crisis; they are actively making it worse. I do not know whether it is incompetence, mismanagement, complacency or deliberate policy, but this Government are wilfully exacerbating the housing crisis. Whether it is homelessness, private renting, leasehold, home ownership or fire safety, the story is always the same: things are getting worse, not better. The problems can be traced to bad Government policies. In government, Labour managed to successfully tackle these issues. As a Government in waiting, Labour is the party with the solutions to these problems. Things are getting worse, not better. Rough sleeping has doubled. We heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne) that rough sleeping has gone up by 333% and that someone is dying every fortnight. Only 6,500 homes for social rent were built last year. Home ownership is supposed to be the thing the Conservative party cares about, but nearly 1 million young people are unable to access it. My hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson) was absolutely right to talk about the overwhelming sense of injustice felt by leaseholders. My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) eloquently talked about the plight of permitted development-something the Government want to increase. The problems can be traced right back to the Government. Ministers have stretched the term â€œaffordable housingâ€ to breaking point, to include homes that are let at up to 80% of market rents. We are building the wrong homes, as my hon. Friend the Member for York Central (Rachael Maskell) said. The Government have repeatedly ignored fire safety advice that sprinklers are essential. They have also ignored advice following the Lakanal House and Grenfell Tower fires and refused to intervene in other blocks with aluminium composite material cladding. We have 40,000 people still trapped in deadly buildings. We have also lost more than 170,000 affordable council homes through poorly designed policies. In government, Labour managed to successfully tackle these issues. As a Government in waiting, Labour is the party with the answers to solve these problems and the ability to deliver the change we need. It is the Government's job to solve the housing crisis, and it is the Government's shame that they have failed. This country has a right to expect better, which it will get under a Labour Government.",80930,[],Housing,0,74,housing,562
2019-04-09,Housing,568,Heather Wheeler,Con,False,"This has been a really excellent debate. I have this wonderful speech here, which is obviously way too long, so we are not going to worry about that. The contributions made by so many people in the House make it clear why housing is the No. 1 domestic priority for the Government. We all want Brexit done, so please vote for the deal, and then we can get on with dealing with this stuff. The important thing to me is talking about community land trusts, as my hon.

2019-04-09,Housing,570,Heather Wheeler,Con,False,"That is why it is important that it is coming through. The important thing here is that the guidance is coming through now, and there has been great respect for that, which I am very pleased about. I am appalled at the way in which issues are turned into political footballs. There is no stronger Department in trying to deal with such issues one by one, in a logical way, so that nobody ends up sleeping rough or dying on our streets. The important thing is that the Government totally get this. We are spending an awful lot of money to change things around, because that is what is important. People out there realise that changes are being made in the private rented sector, changes are being made for tenants, and changes are being made to professionalise the professional services-the letting agents and managing agents. Leasehold changes are on the way. There are all sorts of things in our country that are wrong; they need to change, and it is this Government who are going to change them. I am delighted that our ministerial team is on the case, looking at how many houses we need to build in the year; looking at giving councils the freedoms to build more council houses; encouraging social housing to grow; encouraging first-time buyers; encouraging veterans to get on the housing ladder once they leave the armed forces; making sure that veterans are not sleeping rough and that they get the help they need; and looking after people in Scotland, where there are innovative ideas-I looked at rough sleeping issues and Housing First in Glasgow. All these ideas are very important to the Government; no one should be left under any illusion about the fact that only the Government are making the changes that will get these things right. People's lives are at risk. People's happiness is at risk. We want to make sure that fairness is sorted out for the future. I pay huge tribute to the teams of civil servants that are going round the country making sure that people get the help they need. In Medway and Cornwall, there has been a 40% reduction in rough sleepers. These are huge changes, and I am very proud of what the Government are doing.",80930,[],Housing,0,77,housing,381
